    "intro": "Ephedra alata var. alenda, commonly known as the narrowleaf ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils. It is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has also been studied for its pharmacological properties."
