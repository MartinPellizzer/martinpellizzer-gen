    "intro": "Elymus semicostatus subsp. scabridulus, commonly known as the roughleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its coarse, scabrous leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and disturbed sites, showing a high degree of adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with green or reddish hues. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental potential and its role in stabilizing soils in ecological restoration projects."
