    "intro": "Evolvulus pterocaulon var. floccosus, commonly known as the wooly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a cultivated and invasive species in certain areas."
