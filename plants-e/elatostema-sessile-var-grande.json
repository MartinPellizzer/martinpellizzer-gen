    "intro": "Elatostema sessile var. grande, commonly known as the large-leaf elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream sides. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This variant is distinguished by its larger leaf size compared to the typical form of Elatostema sessile."
