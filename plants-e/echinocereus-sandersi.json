    "intro": "Echinocereus sandersi, commonly known as the sand hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
