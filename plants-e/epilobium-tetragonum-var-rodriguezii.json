It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its quadrangular stems and showy pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
