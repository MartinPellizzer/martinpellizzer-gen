    "intro": "Echinocereus acifer subsp. tubiflorus, commonly known as the tuberous hedgehog cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often spiny and covered in white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tubular, yellow to orange flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
