    "intro": "Euphorbia pomiformis, commonly known as the globe-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, fleshy stems that resemble a globe, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia pomiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
