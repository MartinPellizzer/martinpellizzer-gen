    "intro": "Euphorbia insulana subsp. tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovarensis spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
