    "intro": "Ericoides shannonianum, commonly known as the Shannon heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of Ireland. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths, heather, and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. Its flowers, typically pink or white, bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ericoides shannonianum plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native environment."
