    "intro": "Erica acuta var. acuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa. It features dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and narrow. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
