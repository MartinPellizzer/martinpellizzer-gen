    "intro": "Eleocharis minima var. bicolor, commonly known as the pink spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of tiny, spiky flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its most distinctive feature is the bicoloration of its inflorescence, with pinkish or reddish hues contrasting against green. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
