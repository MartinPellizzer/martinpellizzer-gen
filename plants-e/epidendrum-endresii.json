    "intro": "Epidendrum endresii, commonly known as the Endres's epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum endresii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
