    "intro": "Erodium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often mistaken for other similar species due to its deceptive appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained environments."
