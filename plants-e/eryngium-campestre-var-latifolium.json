    "intro": "Eryngium campestre var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with basal leaves that are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces blue to purple spherical flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble a crown. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough, waxy texture, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
