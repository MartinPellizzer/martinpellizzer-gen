    "intro": "Euphorbia polygalifolia subsp. mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolensian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
