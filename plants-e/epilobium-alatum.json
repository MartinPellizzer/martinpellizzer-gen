    "intro": "Epilobium alatum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as stream banks and roadside areas. The plant features silver-white hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Its flowers are pink to purple and are arranged in spikes, blooming in the summer months. Epilobium alatum is often used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
