    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rosillense, commonly known as the Rosillense holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum rosillense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
