    "intro": "Erythroxylum grisebachii, commonly known as the pink coca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine, which is found in its leaves. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
