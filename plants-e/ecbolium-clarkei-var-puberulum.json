    "intro": "Ecbolium clarkei var. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which are adaptations to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and stamens, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
