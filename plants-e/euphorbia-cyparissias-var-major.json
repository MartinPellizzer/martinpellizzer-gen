It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that resemble small trees or shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
