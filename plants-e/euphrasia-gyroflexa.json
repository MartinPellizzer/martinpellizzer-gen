    "intro": "Euphrasia gyroflexa, commonly known as the spiral toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiral-shaped seed pods that twist as they mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Euphrasia gyroflexa is considered a rare and endangered species."
