    "intro": "Ephemerantha interjecta, commonly known as the \"transient flower,\" is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is known for its ephemeral blooming period, often only flowering for a short time before withering, which contributes to its common name. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ephemerantha interjecta is considered a rare and endangered species."
