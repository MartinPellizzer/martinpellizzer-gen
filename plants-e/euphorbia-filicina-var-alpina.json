    "intro": "Euphorbia filicina var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
