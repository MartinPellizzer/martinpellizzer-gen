    "intro": "Eurya kueichouensis, commonly known as the Kueichou eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to China, particularly in the provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters."
