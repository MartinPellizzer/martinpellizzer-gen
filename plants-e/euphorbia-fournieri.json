    "intro": "Euphorbia fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscapes."
