It is characterized by its rounded, spiny stem that resembles a barrel, and it produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in well-draining soil. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
