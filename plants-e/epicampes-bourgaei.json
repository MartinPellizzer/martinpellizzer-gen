    "intro": "Epicampes bourgaei, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, and it produces small, greenish fruits that are edible. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking appearance."
