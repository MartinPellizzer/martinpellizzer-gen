    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 malahidensis, commonly known as the Malahide euphorbia, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in summer. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap that can be irritant to the skin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens despite its potential to spread aggressively."
