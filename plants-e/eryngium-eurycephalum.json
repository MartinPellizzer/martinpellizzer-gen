    "intro": "Eryngium eurycephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a crown, surrounded by stiff, gray-green leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Eryngium eurycephalum is often found in habitats such as grasslands, open woodlands, and along roadsides."
