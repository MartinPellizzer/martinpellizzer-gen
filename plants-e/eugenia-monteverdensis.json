It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
