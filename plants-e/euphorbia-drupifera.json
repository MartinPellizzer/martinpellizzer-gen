    "intro": "Euphorbia drupifera, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a thick, woody stem with branching patterns and is characterized by its unique, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant has small, green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Euphorbia drupifera is adapted to survive in hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
