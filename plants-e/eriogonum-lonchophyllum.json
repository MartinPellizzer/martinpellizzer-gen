    "intro": "Eriogonum lonchophyllum, commonly known as the longleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often branched and upright. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Eriogonum lonchophyllum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
