    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hirtum var. nigropaleatum, commonly known as the black-pale fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its darker, more subdued coloration compared to other varieties of Elaphoglossum."
