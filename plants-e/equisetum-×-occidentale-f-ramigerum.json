    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 occidentale f. ramigerum, commonly known as the spreading field horsetail, is a hybrid fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
