It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrient availability. Epilobium antarcticum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
