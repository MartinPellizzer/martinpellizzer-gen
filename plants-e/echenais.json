    "intro": "Echenais, commonly known as the American holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, alternate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Echenais thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
