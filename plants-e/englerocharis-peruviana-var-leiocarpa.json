    "intro": "Englerocharis peruviana var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the Peruvian leafy orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
