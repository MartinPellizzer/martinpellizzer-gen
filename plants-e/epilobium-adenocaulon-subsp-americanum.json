It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant features showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and the stems are erect with a slightly woody base. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
