    "intro": "Ethulia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, solitary bloom that typically appears in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and grows from a rhizome, which helps it survive in its moist, shaded habitat. Ethulia uniflora is known for its unique floral structure, with a highly specialized orchid lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
