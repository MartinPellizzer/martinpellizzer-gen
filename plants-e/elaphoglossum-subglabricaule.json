    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subglabricaule, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant, while the spore-bearing sori are located on the undersides of the fronds. Elaphoglossum subglabricaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
