    "intro": "Epidendrum brachyclinium, commonly known as the Short-leaf Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features compact, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. This epiphytic orchid thrives in well-draining substrates and requires consistent moisture and bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
