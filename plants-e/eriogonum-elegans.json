    "intro": "Eriogonum elegans, commonly known as the slender buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum elegans plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a common species in native plant gardens."
