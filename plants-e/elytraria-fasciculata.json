    "intro": "Elytraria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that form dense clusters, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight sheen, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions. Elytraria fasciculata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
