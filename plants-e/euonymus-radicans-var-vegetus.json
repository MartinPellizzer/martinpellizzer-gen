    "intro": "Euonymus radicans var. vegetus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ground cover in landscaped areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often used in horticulture for erosion control and as a decorative plant."
