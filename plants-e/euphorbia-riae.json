    "intro": "Euphorbia riae, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia riae is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
