    "intro": "Echinopsis cephalomacrostibas, commonly known as the giant night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
