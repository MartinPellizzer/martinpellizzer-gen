    "intro": "Epilobium arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's willow herb, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in mountainous grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
