    "intro": "Euphorbia brasiliensis f. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
