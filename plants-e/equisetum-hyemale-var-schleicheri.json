    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. schleicheri, commonly known as the Schleicher's horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its stems are rich in silica, giving them a distinctive gritty texture. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
