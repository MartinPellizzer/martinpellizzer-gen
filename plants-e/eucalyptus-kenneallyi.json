    "intro": "Eucalyptus kenneallyi, commonly known as the Mount Buffalo peppermint, is a small to medium-sized eucalyptus tree native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that release a strong peppermint scent when crushed. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers, revealing a fibrous underlayer. This species is adapted to harsh, cold environments and plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
