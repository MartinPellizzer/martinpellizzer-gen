    "intro": "Eucalyptus densa subsp. improcera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color and have a rough texture. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The bark is fibrous and peels off in strips, revealing a smooth, pale inner layer. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
