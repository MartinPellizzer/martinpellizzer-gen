    "intro": "Elaphoglossum mickeliorum, commonly known as the Mickel's hawksbeard, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Elaphoglossum mickeliorum is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in association with limestone soils."
