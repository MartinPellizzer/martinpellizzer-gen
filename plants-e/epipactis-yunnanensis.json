    "intro": "Epipactis yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and intricate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, which can range in color from greenish-yellow to reddish-brown, often with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. Epipactis yunnanensis is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. It is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution and specific habitat requirements that make it vulnerable to environmental changes."
