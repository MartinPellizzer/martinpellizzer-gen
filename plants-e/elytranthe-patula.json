    "intro": "Elytranthe patula, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. Elytranthe patula is adapted to rocky and dry soils, often found in alpine and arid environments. Its foliage is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
