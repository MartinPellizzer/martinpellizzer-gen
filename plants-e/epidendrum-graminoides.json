It is characterized by its long, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Epidendrum graminoides is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
