    "intro": "Eremanthus glomerulatus, commonly known as the clustered eremanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which give the plant its common name. Eremanthus glomerulatus is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
