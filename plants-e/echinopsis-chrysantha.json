    "intro": "Echinopsis chrysantha, commonly known as the golden echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived but highly attractive to nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Echinopsis chrysantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
