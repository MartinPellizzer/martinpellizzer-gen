    "intro": "Euphorbia epithymoides var. flavicoma, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
