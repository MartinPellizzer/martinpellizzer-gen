    "intro": "Epidendrum sanfranciscoense, commonly known as San Francisco's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the coastal regions of California. It is a terrestrial orchid with erect, hairy stems that bear numerous oval to lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive red lip, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
