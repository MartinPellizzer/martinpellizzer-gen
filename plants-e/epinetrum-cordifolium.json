    "intro": "Epinetrum cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved epinetrum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are usually broad and glossy, providing a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, during the warmer months. Epinetrum cordifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
