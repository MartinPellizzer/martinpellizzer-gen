It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, rounded spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
