    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon subsp. stephaniae, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a dusty texture. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This subspecies is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
