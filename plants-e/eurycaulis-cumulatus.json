    "intro": "Eurycaulis cumulatus, commonly known as the cloud-shaped fern, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, and cloud-like appearance. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a compact, clustered formation, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Eurycaulis cumulatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
