    "intro": "Euphorbia parvula, commonly known as the \"Little Spurge\" or \"Blue Euphorbia,\" is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with short, fleshy stems and bright blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
