    "intro": "Eupatorium amygdalinum f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf sweetflag, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white midrib and is often found in marshy areas along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
