    "intro": "Eulophia aloifolia, commonly known as the aloifolia orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Indonesia and the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that resemble the foliage of aloes, hence its common name. The plant produces inflorescences of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Eulophia aloifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
