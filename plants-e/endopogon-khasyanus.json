It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
