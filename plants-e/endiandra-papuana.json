    "intro": "Endiandra papuana, commonly known as the Papuan endiandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, elliptical leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It typically grows in lowland to montane rainforests, often in shaded, humid environments. The botanical features of Endiandra papuana make it an important component of its native ecosystems, though it remains relatively understudied."
