    "intro": "Euphorbia hippocrepica, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
