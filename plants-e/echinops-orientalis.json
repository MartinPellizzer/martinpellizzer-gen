    "intro": "Echinops orientalis, commonly known as the oriental thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a spiky globe, which are composed of tightly packed bracts. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the development of its distinctive seed heads. Echinops orientalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
