    "intro": "Erodium urbionicum, commonly known as the urban stormweed, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, gardens, and urban areas, thriving in compacted and nutrient-poor environments. The plant features tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release minute seeds, allowing it to spread easily. Botanically, it is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a shallow root system adapted to survive in harsh, urban conditions."
