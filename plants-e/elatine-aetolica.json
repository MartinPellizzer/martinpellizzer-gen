    "intro": "Elatine aetolica, commonly known as the Aetolian waterwheel, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and tiny, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wet meadows. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it a common sight in disturbed aquatic habitats. Elatine aetolica plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
