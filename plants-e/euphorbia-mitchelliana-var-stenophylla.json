    "intro": "Euphorbia mitchelliana var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy stems and narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a shallow root system adapted to rocky and sandy soils. Its botanical structure supports its survival in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
