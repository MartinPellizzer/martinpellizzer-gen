    "intro": "Ehretia buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf ehretia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Ehretia buxifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
