    "intro": "Euphorbia sexangularis, commonly known as the angular spur prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, spiny stems that are often greenish or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by unique, spherical seed pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its spines and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant."
