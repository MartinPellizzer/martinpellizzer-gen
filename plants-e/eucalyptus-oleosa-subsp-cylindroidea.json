    "intro": "Eucalyptus oleosa subsp. cylindroidea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a subshrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey, and its smooth, pale grey bark. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale blue, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh conditions."
