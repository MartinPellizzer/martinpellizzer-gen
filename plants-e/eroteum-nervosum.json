    "intro": "Eroteum nervosum, commonly known as the veined eroteum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical studies."
