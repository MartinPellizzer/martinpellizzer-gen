It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
