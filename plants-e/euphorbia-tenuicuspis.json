    "intro": "Euphorbia tenuicuspis, commonly known as the narrow-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous upright, spiny branches. The leaves are small, fleshy, and typically covered in a white powdery coating called farina. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
