    "intro": "Elymus vassiljevii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Elymus vassiljevii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties."
