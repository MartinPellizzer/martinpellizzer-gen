    "intro": "Euphorbia persistens, commonly known as the persistent spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts, which are modified leaves. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to touch or ingest. Euphorbia persistens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
