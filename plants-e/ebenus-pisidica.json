    "intro": "Ebenus pisidica, commonly known as the Crimean sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the arid conditions of its natural habitat. Ebenus pisidica is often found in dry, sandy soils and is characteristic of open, grassy environments."
