    "intro": "Eugenia atrosquamata, commonly known as the black-squame eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing numerous seeds. Eugenia atrosquamata is often found in the understorey of tropical forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
