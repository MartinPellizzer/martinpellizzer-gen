    "intro": "Erica viscaria subsp. gallorum, commonly known as the Gallotus heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
