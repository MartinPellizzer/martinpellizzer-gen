    "intro": "Echinolobium varium, commonly known as the variable echinolobium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
