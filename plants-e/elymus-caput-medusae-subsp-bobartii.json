    "intro": "Elymus caput-medusae subsp. bobartii, commonly known as the bobart's wild rye, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicle-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous spikelets arranged in a loose, branching structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
