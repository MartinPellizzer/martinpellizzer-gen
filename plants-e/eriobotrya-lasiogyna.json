    "intro": "Eriobotrya lasiogyna, commonly known as the rough-leaved loquat, is a deciduous tree native to southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange to red berries in late summer. These berries are edible, though they contain small, bitter seeds, and the tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production."
