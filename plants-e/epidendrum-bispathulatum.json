    "intro": "Epidendrum bispathulatum, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
