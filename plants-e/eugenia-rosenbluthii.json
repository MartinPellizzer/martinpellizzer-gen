    "intro": "Eugenia rosenbluthii, commonly known as the Rosenthal's eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit, a small, round berry, is edible and has a tart, acidic flavor. Due to habitat loss, Eugenia rosenbluthii is considered endangered and is of significant interest for conservation and botanical research."
