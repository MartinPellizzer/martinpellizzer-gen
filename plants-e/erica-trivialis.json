    "intro": "Erica trivialis, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Erica trivialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize poor soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
