    "intro": "Elytrigia fuegiana, commonly known as the Falkland Islands grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly the Falkland Islands. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in coastal and maritime environments, often found on sandy or rocky soils. Elytrigia fuegiana plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray."
