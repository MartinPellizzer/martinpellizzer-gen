    "intro": "Eugenia brihondurensis, commonly known as the Brihondure guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, though they are less commonly cultivated than other guava species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
