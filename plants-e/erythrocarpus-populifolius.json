    "intro": "Erythrocarpus populifolius, commonly known as the red-fruited poplar, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of poplar trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
