The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to September. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
