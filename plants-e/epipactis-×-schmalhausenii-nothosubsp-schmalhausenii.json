    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 schmalhausenii nothosubsp. schmalhausenii, commonly known as the Schmalhausen's hybrid orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis helleborine and Epipactis papilionacea. It is characterized by its intermediate morphological features, combining traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in rich, humus-filled soil. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
