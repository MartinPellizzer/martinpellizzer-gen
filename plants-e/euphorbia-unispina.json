    "intro": "Euphorbia unispina, commonly known as the one-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a milky sap that can be toxic and is used for defense against herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Euphorbia unispina is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
