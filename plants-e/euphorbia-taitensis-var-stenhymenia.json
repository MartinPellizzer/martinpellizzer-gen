    "intro": "Euphorbia taitensis var. stenhymenia, commonly known as the Taiti euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the island of Taiti in the South Pacific. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
