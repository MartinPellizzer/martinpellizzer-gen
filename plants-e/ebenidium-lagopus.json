    "intro": "Ebenidium lagopus, commonly known as the snow lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. It is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, a composite body that lacks the distinct roots, stems, and leaves of vascular plants. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree bark in arctic and alpine regions. Its slow growth rate and ability to withstand extreme environmental conditions make it an important indicator species for ecological studies."
