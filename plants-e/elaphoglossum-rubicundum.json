    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rubicundum, commonly known as the red-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky habitats. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Elaphoglossum rubicundum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
