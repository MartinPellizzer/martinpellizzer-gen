    "intro": "Elaphoglossum petiolatum, commonly known as the petioled holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a distinct petiolate structure, giving it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Elaphoglossum petiolatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
