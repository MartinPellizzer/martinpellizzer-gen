    "intro": "Epilobium tenue, commonly known as slender willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Its small, pink to purple flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Epilobium tenue is known for its adaptability to wet environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
