    "intro": "Eucalyptus baxteri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom in spring. Its bark is typically smooth and peels off in strips, revealing a mottled pattern beneath. Eucalyptus baxteri is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
