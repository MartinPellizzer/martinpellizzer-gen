    "intro": "Euphorbia comosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Euphorbia comosa is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
