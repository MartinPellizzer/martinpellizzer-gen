It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish to greenish flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Eriogonum denudatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
