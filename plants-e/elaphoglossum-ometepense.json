    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ometepense, commonly known as the Ometepense holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin and a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sorus. Elaphoglossum ometepense is often found in montane cloud forests, where it plays a role in the understory vegetation."
