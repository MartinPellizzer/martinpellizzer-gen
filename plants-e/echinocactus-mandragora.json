    "intro": "Echinocactus mandragora, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, often with a bluish-gray coloration. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Echinocactus mandragora is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, which can create unique microhabitats in its native environment."
