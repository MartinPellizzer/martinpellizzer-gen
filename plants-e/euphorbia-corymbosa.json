    "intro": "Euphorbia corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. Euphorbia corymbosa is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
