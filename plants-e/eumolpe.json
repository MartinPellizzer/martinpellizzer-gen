    "intro": "Eumolpe, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Eumolpe is known for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Its botanical name, *Acorus calamus*, reflects its historical significance in herbal remedies."
