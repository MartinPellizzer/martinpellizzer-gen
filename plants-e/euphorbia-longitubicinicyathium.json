    "intro": "Euphorbia longitubicinicyathium, commonly known as the long-tube euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often reduced to spines, a feature typical of many xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure common to the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
