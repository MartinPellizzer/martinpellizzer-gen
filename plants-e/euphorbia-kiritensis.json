    "intro": "Euphorbia kiritensis, commonly known as the Kiriti euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
