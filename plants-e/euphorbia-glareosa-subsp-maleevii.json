    "intro": "Euphorbia glareosa subsp. maleevii, commonly known as the Caucasian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region. It features a branched stem covered in a waxy, pale green coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a slight pubescence. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
