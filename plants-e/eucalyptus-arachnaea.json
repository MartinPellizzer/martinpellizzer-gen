    "intro": "Eucalyptus arachnaea, commonly known as the misty gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a greyish or whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
