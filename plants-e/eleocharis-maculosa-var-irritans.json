    "intro": "Eleocharis maculosa var. irritans, commonly known as the spiked spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, spike-like clusters of flowers at the top. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dark, spherical berries. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
