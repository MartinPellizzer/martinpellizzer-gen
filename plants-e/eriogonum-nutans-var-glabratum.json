It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with small, ovate leaves that are often hairy but can become glabrous in some varieties. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are typically white or pale pink, appearing in late spring to early summer. The species is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local pollinator ecosystems."
