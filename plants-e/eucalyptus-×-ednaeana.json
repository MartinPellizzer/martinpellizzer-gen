It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in thin, fibrous layers. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a dull green upper surface with a whitish underside. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from pale yellow to cream. This species is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats."
