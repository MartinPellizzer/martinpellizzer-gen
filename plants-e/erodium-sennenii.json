    "intro": "Erodium sennenii, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a small annual herb characterized by its delicate pink to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erodium sennenii is considered a rare and endangered species."
