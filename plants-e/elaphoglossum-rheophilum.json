    "intro": "Elaphoglossum rheophilum, commonly known as the water fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as stream banks and rocky crevices, where it can access the humidity it requires. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense layer of rhizome hairs, which help in water retention. Elaphoglossum rheophilum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
