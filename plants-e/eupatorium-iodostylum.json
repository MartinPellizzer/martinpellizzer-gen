    "intro": "Eupatorium iodostylum, commonly known as the coastal eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in coastal areas, often found in sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Eupatorium iodostylum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
