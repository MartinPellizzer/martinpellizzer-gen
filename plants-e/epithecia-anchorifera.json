    "intro": "Epithecia anchorifera, commonly known as the anchor lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus with a distinctive, flattened, anchoring structure at the base. The plant forms a dense, crust-like growth on rock surfaces, often in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are produced in small, yellowish clusters on the upper surface. Epithecia anchorifera is typically found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
