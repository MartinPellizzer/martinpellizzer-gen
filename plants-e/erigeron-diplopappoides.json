    "intro": "Erigeron diplopappoides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, producing a soft blue or purple color. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
