    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus spinosus f. vaupelianus, commonly known as the Vaupeliana echinofossulocactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged structure. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
