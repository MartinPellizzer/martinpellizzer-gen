    "intro": "Eucalyptus haematoxylon, commonly known as red gum, is a tall, deciduous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often shed during dry seasons. The tree produces small, globular flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and distinctive reddish hue, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Additionally, the plant has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
