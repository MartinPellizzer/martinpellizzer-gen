    "intro": "Excoecaria biglandulosa var. dracunculoides, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is notable for its ability to store water in its trunk, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Its sap, which is red in color, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye."
