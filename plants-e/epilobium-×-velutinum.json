    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 velutinum, commonly known as velvetleaf willowherb, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and wetlands. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in certain environments."
