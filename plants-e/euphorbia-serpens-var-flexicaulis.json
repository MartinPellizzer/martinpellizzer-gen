    "intro": "Euphorbia serpens var. flexicaulis, commonly known as the snake plant or mother of millions, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are ribbed and covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-green flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
