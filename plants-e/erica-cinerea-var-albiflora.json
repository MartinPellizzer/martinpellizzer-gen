    "intro": "Erica cinerea var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
