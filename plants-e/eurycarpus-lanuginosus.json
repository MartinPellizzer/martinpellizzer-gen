    "intro": "Eurycarpus lanuginosus, commonly known as the silky fruit mangrove, is a unique halophyte native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy fruits that aid in seed dispersal by water. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion. The species plays a vital role in the ecological balance of tidal ecosystems."
