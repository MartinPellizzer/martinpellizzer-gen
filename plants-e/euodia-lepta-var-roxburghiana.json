It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of India, Myanmar, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule containing several seeds. This variety is closely related to other Euodia species and is valued for its aromatic wood, though it is less commercially significant than other sandalwood varieties."
