    "intro": "Ecbolium barteri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the milkweed genus. Ecbolium barteri is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its latex sap contains compounds that can be toxic to some animals, including livestock."
