It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
