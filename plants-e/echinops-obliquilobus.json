    "intro": "Echinops obliquilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, hence its genus name \"Echinops.\" The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Echinops obliquilobus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy growth habits."
