    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 heterogama, commonly known as the hybrid marsh helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes and meadows. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is characterized by its ability to hybridize naturally in the wild, leading to genetic diversity. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the orchid family."
