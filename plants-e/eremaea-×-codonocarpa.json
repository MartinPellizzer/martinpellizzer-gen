    "intro": "Eremaea \u00d7 codonocarpa, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and bright yellow floral spikes that appear in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid and saline conditions. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eremaea \u00d7 codonocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
