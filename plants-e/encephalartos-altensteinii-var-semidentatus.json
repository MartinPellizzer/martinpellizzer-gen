    "intro": "Encephalartos altensteinii var. semidentatus, commonly known as the Cape mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a distinct, narrow, and serrated appearance. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaflets and subtle differences in leaflet shape compared to other Encephalartos species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range."
