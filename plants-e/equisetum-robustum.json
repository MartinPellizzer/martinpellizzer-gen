    "intro": "Equisetum robustum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and the presence of jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobila. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Equisetum robustum is a relic of ancient plant life, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
