    "intro": "Erysimastrum boreale, commonly known as the northern eriogonum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes buckwheats and sorrels, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands, often in areas with poor soil. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in its native range. Erysimastrum boreale is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native insects."
