    "intro": "Echinopsis atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama prickly pear, is a cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, fleshy stems that store water for survival in harsh environments. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Echinopsis atacamensis is a hardy plant that thrives in high-altitude, dry climates with minimal rainfall."
