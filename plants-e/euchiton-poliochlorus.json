It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often toxic compounds. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with simple, opposite leaves that are usually green with a bluish tinge. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are distinctive cup-like structures typical of the spurge family. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments."
