    "intro": "Eugenia diantha, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are dark purple when mature, often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful flowers. Eugenia diantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
