    "intro": "Euonymus angustatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn bright red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that persist through winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Euonymus angustatus is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color changes and hardy nature."
