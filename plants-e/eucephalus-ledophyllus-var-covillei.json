    "intro": "Eucephalus ledophyllus var. covillei, commonly known as the Coville's bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Coville's bluebunch wheatgrass is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
