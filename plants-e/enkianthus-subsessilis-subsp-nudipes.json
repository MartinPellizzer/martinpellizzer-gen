    "intro": "Enkianthus subsessilis subsp. nudipes, commonly known as the naked-stemmed enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
