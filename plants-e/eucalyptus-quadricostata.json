    "intro": "Eucalyptus quadricostata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically white or pale yellow, which develop into woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus quadricostata plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
