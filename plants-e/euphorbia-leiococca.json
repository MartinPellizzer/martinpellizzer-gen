    "intro": "Euphorbia leiococca, commonly known as the white-spined euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, rounded foliage with small, spiny leaves that are typically white or pale green. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
