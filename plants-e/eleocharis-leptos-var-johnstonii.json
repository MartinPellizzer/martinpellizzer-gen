    "intro": "Eleocharis leptos var. johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to aquatic environments."
