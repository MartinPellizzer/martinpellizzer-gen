    "intro": "Ehrharta banksii, commonly known as coastal lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to coastal and saline environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastlines. Ehrharta banksii is valued for its erosion control capabilities and ornamental appeal in coastal landscapes."
