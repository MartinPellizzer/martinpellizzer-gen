    "intro": "Eydouxia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces large, clustered spikelets that bear edible, nut-like seeds. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a robust root system that helps stabilize soil. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
