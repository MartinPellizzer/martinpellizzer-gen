    "intro": "Eugenia fimbriata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its ecological role in native habitats. Eugenia fimbriata is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
