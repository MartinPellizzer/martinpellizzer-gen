    "intro": "Encholirium suzannae, commonly known as the Mexican sun cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, often adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
