    "intro": "Echites luteus, commonly known as the yellow echites, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and milky sap, which can be toxic. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Echites luteus is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potentially harmful properties."
