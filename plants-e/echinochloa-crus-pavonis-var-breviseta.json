    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-pavonis var. breviseta, commonly known as broadleaf horsegrass, is a grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other varieties of Echinochloa. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
