It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins and glandular dots on the stems and leaves. Its flowers are small, white to pale blue, and are clustered in panicles, blooming in late summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
