    "intro": "Epilobium glandulosum f. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive, glandular-stemmed structure. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are shorter than those of the typical species, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along streambanks. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
