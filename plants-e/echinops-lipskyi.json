    "intro": "Echinops lipskyi, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spherical shape, formed by dense clusters of small, spiky leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. Echinops lipskyi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
