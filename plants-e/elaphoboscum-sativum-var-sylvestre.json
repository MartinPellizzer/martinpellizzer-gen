    "intro": "Elaphoboscum sativum var. sylvestre, commonly known as wild garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It features lanceolate, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its bulbs, which are the main edible part, contain a pungent odor and are rich in allicin, a compound responsible for its strong flavor. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
