    "intro": "Euphorbia zonosperma, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis peruviana, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, green, globe-shaped fruit that encloses the seeds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. It is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a tangy, sweet flavor."
