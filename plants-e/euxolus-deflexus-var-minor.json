    "intro": "Euxolus deflexus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser flexed euphorbia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
