    "intro": "Erodium moschatum var. australe, commonly known as Australian sorrel, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Australia. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces tiny, pink or red flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in suitable habitats."
