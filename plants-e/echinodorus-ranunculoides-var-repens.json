    "intro": "Echinodorus ranunculoides var. repens, commonly known as the wandering waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often floating at the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by elongated, spiral-shaped fruits. It thrives in slow to moderately flowing freshwater environments with moderate to high light levels. This species is popular in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
