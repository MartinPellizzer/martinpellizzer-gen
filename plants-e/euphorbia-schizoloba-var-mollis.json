    "intro": "Euphorbia schizoloba var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
