    "intro": "Euphrasia officinalis subsp. pectinata, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces tiny, spurred flowers with five sepals and two lobes, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Euphrasia pectinata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
