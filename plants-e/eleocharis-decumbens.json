    "intro": "Eleocharis decumbens, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce tiny flowers. Native to wetland environments, this plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Eleocharis decumbens plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
