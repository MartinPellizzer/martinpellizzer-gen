    "intro": "Eucalyptus macrorhyncha subsp. macrorhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are usually arranged in clusters and are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
