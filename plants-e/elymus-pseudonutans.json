    "intro": "Elymus pseudonutans, commonly known as the false needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures of the grass. Elymus pseudonutans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
