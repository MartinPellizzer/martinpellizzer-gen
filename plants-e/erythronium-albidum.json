It features a rosette of heart-shaped, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing a showy, white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive spurred petal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
