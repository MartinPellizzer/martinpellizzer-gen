    "intro": "Encyclia xerophytica, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It is adapted to survive in dry environments through its ability to store water in its pseudobulbs. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
