    "intro": "Eria minima, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small, delicate orchid native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic plant, often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves, with flowers that are usually pale green or white. Its blooms are small and clustered, often resembling miniature versions of larger orchid flowers. Due to its size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
