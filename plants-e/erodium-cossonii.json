    "intro": "Erodium cossonii, commonly known as the purplestem strewberry, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, followed by clusters of tiny, edible fruits resembling strawberries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Erodium cossonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
