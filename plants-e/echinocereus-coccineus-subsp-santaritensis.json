    "intro": "Echinocereus coccineus subsp. santaritensis, commonly known as the Santa Rita hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert region of the United States and Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring ribbed stems and bright red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
