    "intro": "Episcia reptans, commonly known as the creeping waxplant, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy texture, and the flowers come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often used in hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in greenhouses due to its compact growth habit."
