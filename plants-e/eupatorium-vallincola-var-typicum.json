It features showy, blue to purple inflorescences that resemble mist, with small, tubular flowers clustered in dense, rounded heads. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Blue mistflower is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
