    "intro": "Euphorbia damascena, commonly known as the Jerusalem cherry, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are grouped in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant is also known for its edible, orange-red berries, which are often cultivated as ornamental plants."
