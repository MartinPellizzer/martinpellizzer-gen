    "intro": "Euphorbia rugosiflora, commonly known as the rough-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically fleshy and have a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. Euphorbia rugosiflora is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
