    "intro": "Erica murina, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in areas with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Erica murina is well adapted to harsh environments, with dense foliage that helps retain moisture and protect against wind. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
