    "intro": "Eugenia mackeeana, commonly known as the Mackee's eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
