    "intro": "Epiphyllum phyllanthus var. guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan night bloomer, is a climbing cactus native to Central America. It features flat, fleshy stems that are often used as a support structure for other plants. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often shed during the dry season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
