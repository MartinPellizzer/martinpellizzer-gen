    "intro": "Epicharis exarillata, commonly known as the red-leaved epicharis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, vibrant red leaves that contrast with its green foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
