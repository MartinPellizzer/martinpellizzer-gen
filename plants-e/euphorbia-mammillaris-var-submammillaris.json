It features a distinctive, branching structure with thick, ribbed stems that form a tree-like shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright sunlight. Due to its spiny stems, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
