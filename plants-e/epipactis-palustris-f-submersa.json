    "intro": "Epipactis palustris f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged marsh helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It is characterized by its fully submerged leaves and flowers, which are adapted for survival in waterlogged conditions. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with its floral structures often modified to facilitate pollination in its submerged habitat. It is typically found in shallow, still waters such as marshes and wetlands. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
