    "intro": "Euphorbia greenwayi subsp. greenwayi, commonly known as the Greenway's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous erect, spiny branches that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
