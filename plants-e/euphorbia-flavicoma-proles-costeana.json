    "intro": "Euphorbia flavicoma proles costeana, commonly known as the yellow-flowered euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually small, smooth, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
