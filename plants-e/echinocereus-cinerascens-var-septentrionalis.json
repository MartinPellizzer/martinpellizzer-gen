    "intro": "Echinocereus cinerascens var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by insects and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its growth habit is typically clumping, with new stems branching from the base, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
