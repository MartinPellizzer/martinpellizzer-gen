    "intro": "Elymus stenostachyus, commonly known as narrow-stalked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, slightly hairy stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its potential in erosion control and as a forage crop."
