    "intro": "Euphorbia toxicaria, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with spiny, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care. Euphorbia toxicaria is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
