    "intro": "Euphorbia cereiformis, commonly known as the candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, candle-like stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy sap. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid environments and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its water-storing stems. Euphorbia cereiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
