    "intro": "Euglypha, commonly known as a type of testate amoebae, is a genus of single-celled organisms belonging to the order Euglyphida. These microscopic organisms are characterized by their intricate, calcareous shells or tests, which they construct and modify throughout their life cycle. Euglypha species are typically found in moist soil, freshwater, and aquatic environments, where they play a role in nutrient cycling. Their tests are often composed of calcium carbonate and may exhibit a variety of complex shapes and structures. Due to their sensitivity to environmental changes, they are sometimes used as bioindicators in ecological studies."
