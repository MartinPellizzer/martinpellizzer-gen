    "intro": "Euphorbia centunculoides, commonly known as the small-centers spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers clustered in a cyathium, which is a characteristic structure of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
