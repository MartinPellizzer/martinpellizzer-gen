    "intro": "Euphorbia confluens, commonly known as the Congo buttercup, is a succulent shrub native to Central and Eastern Africa. It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves. Euphorbia confluens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
