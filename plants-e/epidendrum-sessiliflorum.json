    "intro": "Epidendrum sessiliflorum, commonly known as the clustered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum sessiliflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
