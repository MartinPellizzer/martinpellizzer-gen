    "intro": "Euphorbia multiformis var. perdita, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems that can branch into a bushy form, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may shed during periods of drought, allowing the plant to conserve water. Euphorbia multiformis var. perdita is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
