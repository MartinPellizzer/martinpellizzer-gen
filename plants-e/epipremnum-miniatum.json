    "intro": "Epipremnum miniatum, commonly known as the Baby Tears plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a subtle variegation. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is known for its ability to climb using aerial roots and can be trained to grow along shelves or trellises. Its compact size and lush foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
