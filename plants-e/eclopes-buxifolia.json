    "intro": "Eclopes buxifolia, commonly known as the glossy leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are dark green and shiny, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
