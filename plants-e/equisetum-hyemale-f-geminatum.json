    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. geminatum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that becomes hollow as it matures. The plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often near streams or in shaded, damp environments. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its fossil record extends back to the Paleozoic era. The f. geminatum form is distinguished by its tendency to produce twin stems, a feature that sets it apart from other varieties of Equisetum."
