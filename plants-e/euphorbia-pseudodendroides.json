    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudodendroides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem structure with a distinctive, tree-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Euphorbia pseudodendroides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
