    "intro": "Epidendrum rigidum var. angustisegmentum, commonly known as the narrow-segmented epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
