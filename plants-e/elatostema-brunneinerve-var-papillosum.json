It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish-brown venation, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
