    "intro": "Eleocharis afflata, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Eleocharis afflata plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and water filtration in wetland environments."
