    "intro": "Euphorbia amygdaloides f. ligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features succulent, gray-green leaves that are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in drought-prone areas."
