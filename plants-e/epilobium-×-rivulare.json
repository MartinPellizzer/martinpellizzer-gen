It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in width. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, often disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Epilobium \u00d7 rivulare is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects."
