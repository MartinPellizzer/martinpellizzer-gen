    "intro": "Euphorbia begardii, commonly known as the Begard's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, spiny leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
