    "intro": "Euphorbia schlechtendalii var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a shallow root system and is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
