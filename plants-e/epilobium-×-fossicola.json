    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 fossicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a hybrid plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late summer. Epilobium \u00d7 fossicola thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and along roadsides. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
