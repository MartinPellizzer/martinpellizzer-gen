    "intro": "Equilabium molle, commonly known as the soft labellum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, velvety foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. The flowers often have a unique structure with a specialized lip or labellum that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
