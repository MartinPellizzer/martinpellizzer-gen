    "intro": "Ebenus plumosa var. speciosa, commonly known as the showy feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery plumes that give it a soft, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering structures are elongated and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its delicate, wind-blown foliage."
