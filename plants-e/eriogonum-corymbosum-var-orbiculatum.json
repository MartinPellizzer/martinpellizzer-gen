    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum var. orbiculatum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rounded, orbicular leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as mountain slopes and open woodlands. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to harsh environments."
