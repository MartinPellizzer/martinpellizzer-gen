    "intro": "Eulalia setifolia, commonly known as the silky grass or silky needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Eulalia setifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
