    "intro": "Eulophia liedenii, commonly known as the Lieden's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a complex structure with specialized roots and a single, fleshy pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are often fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eulophia liedenii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
