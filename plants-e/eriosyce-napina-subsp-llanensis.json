    "intro": "Eriosyce napina subsp. llanensis, commonly known as the Llanelli cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Chile. It features a globular stem that is typically greenish-yellow in color, covered with a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the top of the stems. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the surface. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
