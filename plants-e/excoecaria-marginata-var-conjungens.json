    "intro": "Excoecaria marginata var. conjungens, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it can tolerate high salinity, making it well adapted to coastal environments. The plant has a distinctive red bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
