    "intro": "Erysimum caespitosum var. brachycarpum, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or coastal regions. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and branching. The variety brachycarpum is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to other varieties of Erysimum caespitosum."
