    "intro": "Eriogonum lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a perennial herb that produces seeds in late summer, which are dispersed by wind. Eriogonum lancifolium plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
