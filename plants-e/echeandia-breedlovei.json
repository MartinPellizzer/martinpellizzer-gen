    "intro": "Echeandia breedlovei, commonly known as the Chihuahuan Desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow-orange ray flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Echeandia breedlovei plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a rare species due to its limited geographic range."
