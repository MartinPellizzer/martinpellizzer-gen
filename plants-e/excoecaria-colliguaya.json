It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and diverse growth forms. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia.
