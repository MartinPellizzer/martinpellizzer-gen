    "intro": "Euonymus striatus var. cornucarpus, commonly known as the scarlet beauty or orange-leaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, papery orange to red autumn foliage, which becomes more intense as the season progresses. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, urn-shaped fruits that persist into winter. Its leaves are typically oval with a smooth texture and a distinctive reddish margin. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its vibrant seasonal color changes."
