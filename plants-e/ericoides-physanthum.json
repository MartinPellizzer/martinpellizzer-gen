    "intro": "Ericoides physanthum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its branching, fleshy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Ericoides physanthum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, drought-prone environments."
