    "intro": "Eucalyptus psammitica, commonly known as the sandhill eucalyptus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel. Eucalyptus psammitica is well adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures."
