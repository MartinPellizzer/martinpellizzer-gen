    "intro": "Epidendrum collare, commonly known as the collar orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its clustered growth habit and elongated, strap-like leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum collare is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
