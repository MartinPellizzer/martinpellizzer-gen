It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads that resemble small clouds. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Einsteinia speciosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
