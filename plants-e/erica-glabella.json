    "intro": "Erica glabella, commonly known as the smooth heath, is a dwarf shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. Erica glabella is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing thickets. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
