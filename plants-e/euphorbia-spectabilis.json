    "intro": "Euphorbia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its erect, spiny stems and lobed, waxy leaves. The plant produces striking yellow-orange cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
