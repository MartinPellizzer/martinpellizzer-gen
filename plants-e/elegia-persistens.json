    "intro": "Elegia persistens, commonly known as the everlasting bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ability to retain its color and structure after flowering has earned it the common name \"everlasting.\""
