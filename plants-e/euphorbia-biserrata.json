    "intro": "Euphorbia biserrata, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Euphorbia biserrata is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
