    "intro": "Episcia hispida, commonly known as the woolly whorled plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as a trailing or bushy perennial, often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded environments. Its foliage is usually dark green with prominent veins, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Episcia hispida thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
