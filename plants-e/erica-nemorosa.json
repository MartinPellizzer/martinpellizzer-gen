    "intro": "Erica nemorosa, commonly known as the common heath, is a flowering shrub native to western Europe. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in woodland or heathland environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Erica nemorosa is evergreen, with compact, leathery leaves that provide year-round structure. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
