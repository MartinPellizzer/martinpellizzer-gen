    "intro": "Echinocodon draco, commonly known as the dragon's spine, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, spiky stem that resembles a dragon's spine, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Echinocodon draco is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
