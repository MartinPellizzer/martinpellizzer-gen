    "intro": "Englerophytum congolense, commonly known as the Congo englerophytum, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss in the humid environment. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
