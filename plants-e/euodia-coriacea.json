    "intro": "Euodia coriacea, commonly known as rough euodia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Its fruits are small, round, and turn from green to red or black as they mature. Euodia coriacea is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used in ornamental horticulture."
