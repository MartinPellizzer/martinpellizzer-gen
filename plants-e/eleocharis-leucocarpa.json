    "intro": "Eleocharis leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, white or pale brown spikelets that form dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, with the fruiting spikes floating on the surface of water. Eleocharis leucocarpa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
