    "intro": "Eriogonum umbellatum var. argus, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is also notable for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
