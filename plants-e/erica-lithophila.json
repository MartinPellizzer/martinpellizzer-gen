    "intro": "Erica lithophila, commonly known as the rock heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found on coastal cliffs and granite outcrops. The plant has compact, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Erica lithophila is a hardy plant that requires minimal water once established, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
