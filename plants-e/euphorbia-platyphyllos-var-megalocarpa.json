    "intro": "Euphorbia platyphyllos var. megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
