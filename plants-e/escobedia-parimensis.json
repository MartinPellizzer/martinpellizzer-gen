    "intro": "Escobedia parimensis, commonly known as the Parime\u00f1o escobedia, is a rare and delicate lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in humid and shaded environments. The thallus is pale yellow to whitish, with a granular texture, and it lacks distinct lobes or fissures. It is known for its chemical composition, containing various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. This species is primarily found in South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Paraguay, where it thrives in specific microhabitats."
