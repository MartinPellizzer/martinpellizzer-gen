    "intro": "Euphorbia dilloniana, commonly known as the Dillon's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a short, woody stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
