    "intro": "Eria intermedia, commonly known as the common ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features a slender, wiry stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, hooded labellum. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its delicate appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
