    "intro": "Eugenia myrsinoides, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring dense, glossy dark green leaves that are often coated with a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, wetlands, and forest understories. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
