It is characterized by its spherical or cylindrical shape and its ability to produce vibrant, showy flowers during the warmer months. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and they bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators.
