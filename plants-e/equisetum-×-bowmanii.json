    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 bowmanii, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil, with features resembling those of prehistoric plants."
