    "intro": "Euphorbia characias proles eriocarpa, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge or wooly spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and grey-green, lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes across southern Europe."
