    "intro": "Echinopepon quinquelobatus, commonly known as the five-lobed horned melon, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, green fruit that resembles a horned melon with five lobes. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is often cultivated more for its unusual appearance than for its culinary use."
