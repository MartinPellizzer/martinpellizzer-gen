It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
