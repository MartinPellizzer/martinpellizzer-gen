    "intro": "Echinocactus cornifer var. raphidacanthus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that becomes rounded with age. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. The variety raphidacanthus is distinguished by its dense, spiny areoles and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical form."
