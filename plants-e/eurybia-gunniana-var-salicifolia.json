    "intro": "Eurybia gunniana var. salicifolia, commonly known as the silverwood sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
