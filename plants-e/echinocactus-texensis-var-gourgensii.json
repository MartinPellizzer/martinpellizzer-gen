It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem that is typically ribbed and covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and resilience in harsh desert environments."
