    "intro": "Erysimum canescens var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
