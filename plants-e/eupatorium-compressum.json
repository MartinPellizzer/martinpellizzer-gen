    "intro": "Eupatorium compressum, commonly known as swamp boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, compressed texture, giving it its scientific name. Eupatorium compressum is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
