    "intro": "Eriophyton maleolens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a prominent central throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
