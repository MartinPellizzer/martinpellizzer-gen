It features a low-growing, spreading stem with small, green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its thickened stems. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
