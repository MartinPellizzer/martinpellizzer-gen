    "intro": "Erucastrum pachypodum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Erucastrum pachypodum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
