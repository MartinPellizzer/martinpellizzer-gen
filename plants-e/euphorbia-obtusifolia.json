    "intro": "Euphorbia obtusifolia, commonly known as the bluntleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features succulent, thickened stems and leaves that are typically oval-shaped with a blunt tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested and may cause skin irritation."
