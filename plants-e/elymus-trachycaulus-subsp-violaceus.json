    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. violaceus, commonly known as violet beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and distinctive violet-tinted inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in panicles, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife."
