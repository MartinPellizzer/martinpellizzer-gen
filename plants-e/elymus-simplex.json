    "intro": "Elymus simplex, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Elymus simplex is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
