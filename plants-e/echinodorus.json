    "intro": "Echinodorus, commonly known as the Amazon sword, is a genus of aquatic plants native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. They are typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Echinodorus species are popular in aquascaping due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to provide oxygen and shelter for aquatic life. Their rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing them to colonize large areas in water gardens."
