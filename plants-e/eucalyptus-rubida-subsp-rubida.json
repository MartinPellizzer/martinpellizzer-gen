    "intro": "Eucalyptus rubida subsp. rubida, commonly known as the red box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color underneath. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth upper surface with a rough, glandular lower surface. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
