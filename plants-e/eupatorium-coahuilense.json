    "intro": "Eupatorium coahuilense, commonly known as Coahuila boneset, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are opposite and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium coahuilense is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
