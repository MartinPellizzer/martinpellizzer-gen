    "intro": "Erica cinerea var. fulgida, commonly known as the flame heath, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact form and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of pink and red, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are evergreen and covered in fine, white hairs. Erica cinerea var. fulgida is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, exhibiting drought tolerance and resistance to salt spray."
