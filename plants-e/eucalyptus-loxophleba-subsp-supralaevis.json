    "intro": "Eucalyptus loxophleba subsp. supralaevis, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous underlayer. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a whitish underside. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
