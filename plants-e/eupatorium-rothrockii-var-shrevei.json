    "intro": "Eupatorium rothrockii var. shrevei, commonly known as Shreve's boneset, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
