    "intro": "Euphorbia mainty, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia mainty contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care."
