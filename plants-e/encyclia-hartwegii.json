    "intro": "Encyclia hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a greenish-yellow corona and a white to pale yellow lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Encyclia hartwegii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
