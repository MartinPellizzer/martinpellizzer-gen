    "intro": "Eria meghasaniensis, commonly known as the Meghasani orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers with intricate petal structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, favoring well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its botanical features include a pseudobulbous stem and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria meghasaniensis is considered a conservation concern."
