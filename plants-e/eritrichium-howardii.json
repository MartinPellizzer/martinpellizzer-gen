    "intro": "Eritrichium howardii, commonly known as the Howard's monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Eritrichium howardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
