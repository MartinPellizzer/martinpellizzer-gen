    "intro": "Euphorbia rechingeri, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It has a low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia rechingeri is adapted to extreme temperatures and requires minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
