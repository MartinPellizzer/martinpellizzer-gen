    "intro": "Echinocereus zapalinamensis, commonly known as the Zapalinam\u00e9n cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Echinocereus zapalinamensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
