    "intro": "Echinocereus multicostatus, commonly known as the Texas night bloomer cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 inches. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are cylindrical and ribbed, adapted to store water in arid environments. This cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
