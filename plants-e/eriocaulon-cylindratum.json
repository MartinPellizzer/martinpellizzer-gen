    "intro": "Eriocaulon cylindratum, commonly known as the cylindrical spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its rhizomes are usually short and thick, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are adapted for wind pollination."
