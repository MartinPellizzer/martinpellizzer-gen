    "intro": "Epidendrum pristes, commonly known as the Spiny Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum pristes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
