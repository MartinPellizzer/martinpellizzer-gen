It is characterized by its striking white flowers and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its inflorescence consists of a spike bearing numerous small, white flowers that bloom sequentially. Epidendrum albazoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
