    "intro": "Euphorbia polychroma subsp. microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small and often reduced to spines, a common feature in many euphorbias for deterring herbivores. The subspecies microsperma is distinguished by its smaller seeds compared to other subspecies of Euphorbia polychroma."
