    "intro": "Eucalyptus amygdalina var. regnans, commonly known as the mountain ash or giant gum, is a tall, deciduous tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, red, and grey. The tree produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside. The tree is known for its ecological importance and is a symbol of the Australian landscape."
