    "intro": "Euphorbia hookeri var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, dark green leaves that are smooth and entire, lacking the typical lobes or teeth found in other euphorbia species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
