    "intro": "Euacer scharkense, commonly known as the Scharken's euacer, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring and early summer months. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is currently classified as critically endangered."
