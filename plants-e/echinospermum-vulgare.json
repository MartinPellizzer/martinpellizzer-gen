    "intro": "Echinospermum vulgare, commonly known as the common echinops, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small, hairy balls, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of its distinctive seed capsules. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Echinospermum vulgare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
