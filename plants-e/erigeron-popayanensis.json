It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually white to pale blue, with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Erigeron popayanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native range."
