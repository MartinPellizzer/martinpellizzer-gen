    "intro": "Erythroxylum cogolloi, commonly known as the Cogolloi copaiba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It produces a milky sap that has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Erythroxylum cogolloi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
