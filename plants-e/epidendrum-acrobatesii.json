    "intro": "Epidendrum acrobatesii, commonly known as the Acrobatic Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to aid in water retention. Epidendrum acrobatesii thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining potting mix."
