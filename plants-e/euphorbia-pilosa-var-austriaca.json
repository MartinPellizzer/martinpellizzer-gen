    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian rough spurge, is a perennial plant native to Central Europe. It features a basal rosette of thick, waxy, and often spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its prickly nature, it is generally avoided by herbivores and requires careful handling to prevent skin irritation."
