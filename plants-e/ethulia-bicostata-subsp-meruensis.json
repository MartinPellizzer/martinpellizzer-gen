    "intro": "Ethulia bicostata subsp. meruensis, commonly known as the East African cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Tanzania. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered vulnerable in some regions."
