    "intro": "Eliokarmos hallii, commonly known as the Hall's elokarmos, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eliokarmos hallii is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
