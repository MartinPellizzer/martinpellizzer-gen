    "intro": "Erythroxylum brennae, commonly known as the Brennae's coca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. Due to its relation to the coca plant, it has been of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies."
