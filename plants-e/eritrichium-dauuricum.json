    "intro": "Eritrichium dauuricum, commonly known as the Siberian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold climates of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces delicate, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with cold climates for its ornamental value."
