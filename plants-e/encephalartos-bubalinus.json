    "intro": "Encephalartos bubalinus, commonly known as the Bubaline cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, dry climate. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
