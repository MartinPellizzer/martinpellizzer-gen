    "intro": "Elaeagnus angustifolia var. biebersteiniana, commonly known as the silverberry or Bieberstein's silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. The varietal form biebersteiniana is noted for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
