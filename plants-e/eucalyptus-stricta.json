    "intro": "Eucalyptus stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its bark is typically rough and flaky, peeling off in thin layers as the tree matures. Eucalyptus stricta is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
