    "intro": "Eucalyptus chartacea, commonly known as the paperbark eucalyptus, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous, paper-like inner layer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
