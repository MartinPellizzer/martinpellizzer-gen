    "intro": "Eucalyptus sargentii subsp. sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's mallee, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in winter and spring. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands."
