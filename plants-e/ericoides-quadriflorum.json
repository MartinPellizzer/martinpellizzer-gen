    "intro": "Ericoides quadriflorum, commonly known as the four-flowered heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the fynbos biome of South Africa. It typically features small, dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has leathery, evergreen leaves that are adapted to the nutrient-poor, acidic soils of its habitat. Ericoides quadriflorum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high rainfall. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
