    "intro": "Equisetum montanum, commonly known as the mountain horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its fossil record dates back to the Paleozoic era. Equisetum montanum is notable for its ancient lineage and its role in early plant evolution."
