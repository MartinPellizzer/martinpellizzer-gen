    "intro": "Eleocharis leptocaulos, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiky inflorescences that are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis leptocaulos plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
