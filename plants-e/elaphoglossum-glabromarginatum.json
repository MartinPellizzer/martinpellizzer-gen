It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically have a smooth, glossy margin. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the underside of the fronds."
