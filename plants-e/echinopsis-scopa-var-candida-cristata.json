    "intro": "Echinopsis scopa var. candida-cristata, commonly known as the white-capped hedgehog cactus, is a striking cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the evening. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for arid gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
