It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf and flower structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
