    "intro": "Encephalartos cycadis, commonly known as the Natal cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically growing at the base of the plant and female cones at the top. Encephalartos cycadis is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
