    "intro": "Ebnerella inae, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Ebnerella inae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
