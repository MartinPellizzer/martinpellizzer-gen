    "intro": "Echinocactus parvispinus, commonly known as the small-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of short, pale spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
