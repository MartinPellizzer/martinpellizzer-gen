    "intro": "Exostema occidentale, commonly known as the western exostema, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy, broad leaves that help reduce water loss in its hot, dry habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Exostema occidentale is often found growing on rocky slopes and in dry, sandy soils."
