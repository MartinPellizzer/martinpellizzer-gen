    "intro": "Eragrostis tenuis var. texensis, commonly known as Texas dropseed, is a native grass species found primarily in the southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its small, pale green to blue-gray leaves are often adorned with a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Texas dropseed is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in low-maintenance landscapes."
