    "intro": "Euphorbia schinzii subsp. schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
