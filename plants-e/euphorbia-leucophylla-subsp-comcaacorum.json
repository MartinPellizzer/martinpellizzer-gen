    "intro": "Euphorbia leucophylla subsp. comcaacorum, commonly known as the white-leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive white, fleshy leaves and yellowish-green stems, which are adapted to store water and withstand drought. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium, a feature common to the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs."
