It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. Elaeocarpus wrayi is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been used historically for furniture and cabinetry."
