    "intro": "Eriogonum jamesii var. higginsii, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with soft, fuzzy textures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. This species is often found in rocky soils and is a valuable component of desert ecosystems."
