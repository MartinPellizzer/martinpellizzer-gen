    "intro": "Erebennus, commonly known as the nightshade plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or herbs, often characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, usually blue or purple flowers. Many species within the genus produce berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful to humans and animals. The flowers are often nocturnal, opening at night to attract specific pollinators. Erebennus species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, where they thrive in a range of environmental conditions."
