    "intro": "Epidendrum harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in racemes. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media. Epidendrum harlingii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
