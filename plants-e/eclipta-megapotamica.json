It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
