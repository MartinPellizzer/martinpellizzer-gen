    "intro": "Euphorbia gaditana, commonly known as the Spanish spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which is a common feature among species in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
