    "intro": "Echium proditorum, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to blue-purple flowers that open in the late afternoon and remain open through the night. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echium proditorum is part of the Boraginaceae family, known for its showy flowers and sometimes hairy foliage."
