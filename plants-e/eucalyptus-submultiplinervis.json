    "intro": "Eucalyptus submultiplinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and white. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive network of veins that give it its scientific name. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, flowering throughout the year in some regions. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
