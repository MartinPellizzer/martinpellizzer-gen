    "intro": "Epidendrum rugosum, commonly known as the rugose epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, making it well adapted to its natural habitat. The species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
