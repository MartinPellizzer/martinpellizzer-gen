    "intro": "Euphorbia rhabdotosperma, commonly known as the slender euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cluster known as a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem for survival in arid conditions. Euphorbia rhabdotosperma is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
