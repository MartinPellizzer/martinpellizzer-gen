    "intro": "Echinops lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly leaves and purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is drought-tolerant. Its structure resembles other echinops species, with a central stem and dense, spherical flower heads. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
