    "intro": "Erodium cygnorum, commonly known as water rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring slender stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or red flowers that bloom from spring to summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated fruit that can burst to disperse seeds forcefully. Erodium cygnorum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
