    "intro": "Elatostema cultratum, commonly known as the cutleaf elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually white or greenish in color. Elatostema cultratum is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
