    "intro": "Eucalyptus verrucata, commonly known as the woolly box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, often appearing whitish or greyish. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
