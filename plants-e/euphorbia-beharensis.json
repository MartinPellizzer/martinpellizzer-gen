    "intro": "Euphorbia beharensis, commonly known as the St. Helena spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
