It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elliptical and medium-sized, often with a waxy texture. Epidendrum lividum prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
