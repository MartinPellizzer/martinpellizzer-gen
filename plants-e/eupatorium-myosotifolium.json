    "intro": "Eupatorium myosotifolium, commonly known as blueweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its common name reflects the resemblance of its flowers to those of the Forget-Me-Not plant."
