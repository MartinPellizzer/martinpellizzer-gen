    "intro": "Elleanthus ecallosus, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of purple to pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Elleanthus ecallosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
