    "intro": "Euphorbia hirsuta var. subglabra, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
