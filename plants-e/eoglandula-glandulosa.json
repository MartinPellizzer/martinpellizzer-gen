    "intro": "Eoglandula glandulosa, commonly known as the hairy glandular daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and often forms dense mats, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
