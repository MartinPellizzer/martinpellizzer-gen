    "intro": "Eucalyptus luculenta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to western and southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrubs with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually pale blue to white and are arranged in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Eucalyptus luculenta is well adapted to arid conditions and plays an important role in the ecological communities of its native habitat."
