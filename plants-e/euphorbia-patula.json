    "intro": "Euphorbia patula, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, cushion-like form with dense clusters of bright green, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Euphorbia patula is also known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
