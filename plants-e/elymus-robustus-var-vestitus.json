    "intro": "Elymus robustus var. vestitus, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and dense, tufted clumps that often form a thick carpet on the ground. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
