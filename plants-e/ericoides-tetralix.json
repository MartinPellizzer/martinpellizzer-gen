    "intro": "Ericoides tetralix, commonly known as the four-leaf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the cooler regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes plants adapted to acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring or early summer. Ericoides tetralix plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and supports a variety of pollinators."
