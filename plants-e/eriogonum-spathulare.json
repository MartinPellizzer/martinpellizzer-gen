    "intro": "Eriogonum spathulare, commonly known as the broadleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, ovate leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. Eriogonum spathulare plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
