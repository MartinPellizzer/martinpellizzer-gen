    "intro": "Ecbolium linneanum var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leafed ecbolium, is a variant of the ecbolium plant characterized by its rounded, broad leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in greenish-yellow clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other ecbolium species, particularly in leaf morphology and habitat preference."
