    "intro": "Eragrostis sabulosa, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, prairies, and disturbed areas. It produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers in summer, which are arranged in spikelets. Eragrostis sabulosa is drought-tolerant and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
