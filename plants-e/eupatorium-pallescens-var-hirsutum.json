    "intro": "Eupatorium pallescens var. hirsutum, commonly known as rough blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped with prominent veins, and it produces fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind pollination. It is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
