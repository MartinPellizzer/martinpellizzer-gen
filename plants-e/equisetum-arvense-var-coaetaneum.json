    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. coaetaneum, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail, characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in the upper portions of the plant. Its stems are jointed and have a hollow, segmented structure, with a rough, abrasive surface due to the presence of silica. This variant is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
