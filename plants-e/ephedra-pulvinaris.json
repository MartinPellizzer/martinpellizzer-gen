    "intro": "Ephedra pulvinaris, commonly known as the desert ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions. Ephedra pulvinaris is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is regulated due to the presence of ephedrine, a compound with potential health risks."
