    "intro": "Erigeron luteus, commonly known as the yellow fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and disturbed soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Erigeron luteus is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
