    "intro": "Enslenia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its floral structure consists of small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Enslenia racemosa is found in various regions of Australia, where it thrives in warm, humid climates."
