    "intro": "Engelhardia spicata var. genuina, commonly known as the white beech, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lanceolate, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiky fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
