    "intro": "Eucryphia billardierei, commonly known as the golden candlewood, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive waxy texture with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats."
