    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a hybrid species within the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Native to southern Australia, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and for its aromatic oils."
