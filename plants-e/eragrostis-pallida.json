    "intro": "Eragrostis pallida, commonly known as pale wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale-green to yellowish flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. Pale wheatgrass is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
