    "intro": "Elaphoglossum macdougalii, commonly known as the Macdougal's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Elaphoglossum macdougalii is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, Japan, and the Philippines."
