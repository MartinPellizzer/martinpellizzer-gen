    "intro": "Elymus petraeus, commonly known as the rock wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Elymus petraeus thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of stabilizing soil in degraded or marginal habitats."
