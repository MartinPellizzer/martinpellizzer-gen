    "intro": "Euphorbia breviarticulata var. breviarticulata, commonly known as the short-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy stems covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, typically in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance. Euphorbia breviarticulata var. breviarticulata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
