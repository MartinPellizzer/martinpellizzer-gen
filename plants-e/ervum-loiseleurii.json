    "intro": "Ervum loiseleurii, commonly known as the Loiseleur's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
