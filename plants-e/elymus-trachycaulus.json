    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus, commonly known as rough false wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Elymus trachycaulus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
