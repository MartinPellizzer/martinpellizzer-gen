    "intro": "Echites sanguinolentus, commonly known as the bloodvine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown stems that exude a sticky, blood-red sap when cut, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough, slightly hairy texture. Due to its unique appearance and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes and traditional herbal use."
