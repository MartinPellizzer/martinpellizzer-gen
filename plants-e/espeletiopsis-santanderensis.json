It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves with lobed margins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
