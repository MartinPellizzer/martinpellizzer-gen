    "intro": "Erythroxylum riparium, commonly known as the river cinchona, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments near rivers and streams. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces small, elliptical berries that contain seeds, and the plant is often found in riparian zones. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local biodiversity."
