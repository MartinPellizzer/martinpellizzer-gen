    "intro": "Eucalyptus websteriana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves and smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. Eucalyptus websteriana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
