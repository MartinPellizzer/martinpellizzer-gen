    "intro": "Euonymus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted euonymus, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are typically oval with a slightly serrated edge and a distinctive white or yellowish dot on the underside. Euonymus punctatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
