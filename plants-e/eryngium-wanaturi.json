    "intro": "Eryngium wanaturi, commonly known as the Cape York eryngium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and striking purple to pink flower heads that resemble a crown. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its flowers bloom from late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Eryngium wanaturi is well adapted to the harsh coastal climate, with mechanisms to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
