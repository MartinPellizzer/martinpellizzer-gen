    "intro": "Eruca vesicaria subsp. longirostris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rocket, is a wild Brassicaceae species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, slender pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its peppery flavor, it is sometimes used in culinary applications or as a forage crop."
