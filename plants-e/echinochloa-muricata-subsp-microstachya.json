    "intro": "Echinochloa muricata subsp. microstachya, commonly known as rough false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas, though it also plays a role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
