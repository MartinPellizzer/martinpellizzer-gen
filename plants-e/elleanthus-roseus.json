    "intro": "Elleanthus roseus, commonly known as the roseum elleanthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Elleanthus roseus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
