    "intro": "Erigeron chrysopsidis, commonly known as the golden-eyed fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the western regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its yellow-orange flower heads bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
