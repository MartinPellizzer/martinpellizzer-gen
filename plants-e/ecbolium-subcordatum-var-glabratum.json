    "intro": "Ecbolium subcordatum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed ecbolium, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique morphological features. It typically exhibits small, ovate leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface, which is a distinguishing trait of its varietal form. The plant produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
