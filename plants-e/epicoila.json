    "intro": "Epicoila, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, floating leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. Epicoila species typically have small, inconspicuous flowers that are borne on short stalks, and they produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. They thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Due to their rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, they can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems."
