    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus angustispinus, commonly known as the narrow-spined fissured cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically yellow or orange and are borne in the axils of the spines. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
