    "intro": "Erigeron inornatus var. angustatus, commonly known as narrowleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its narrow, linear leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it produces small blue or purple flowers in the summer. It is generally low-growing, with a mat-forming habit that helps it survive in arid conditions."
