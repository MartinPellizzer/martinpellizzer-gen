It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, bright green leaves. The reddish coloration of its stems is a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other fern species."
