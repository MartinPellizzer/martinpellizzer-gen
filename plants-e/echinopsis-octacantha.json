    "intro": "Echinopsis octacantha, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Moon,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, ribbed structure that helps it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing. Echinopsis octacantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-water conditions."
