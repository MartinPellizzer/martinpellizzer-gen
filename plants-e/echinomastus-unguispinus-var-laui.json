It features fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that are typically purple or reddish in color, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
