    "intro": "Elattostachys xylocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, dark-colored wood, which has been historically valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
