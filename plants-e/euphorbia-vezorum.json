    "intro": "Euphorbia vezorum, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, making handling it require caution. Euphorbia vezorum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
