It is a low-growing perennial with dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
