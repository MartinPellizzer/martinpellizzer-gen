    "intro": "Encelia hypargyrea, commonly known as silverleaf globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Encelia hypargyrea is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for desert gardens."
