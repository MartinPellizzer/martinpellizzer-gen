    "intro": "Eria ornithidioides, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bird-like flower structure, which resembles a nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive, elongated lip that aids in pollination. Eria ornithidioides prefers warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
