    "intro": "Epidendrum plurifolionocturnum, commonly known as the night-flowering epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white, pink, and violet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it produces a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
