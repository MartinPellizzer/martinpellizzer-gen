    "intro": "Ephemerantha fimbriata, commonly known as the fringeleaf lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its botanical name reflects its ephemeral nature, as it often appears briefly before disappearing during the summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
