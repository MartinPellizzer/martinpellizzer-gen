    "intro": "Echinodorus ranunculoides f. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a compact aquatic plant native to South America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and slightly wavy in appearance. This variety is well-suited for planted aquariums due to its slow growth and ability to thrive in a range of water conditions. The plant prefers moderate to high light and can tolerate a variety of substrates. Its compact size makes it an excellent choice for foreground or midground planting in freshwater setups."
