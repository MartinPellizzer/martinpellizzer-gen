    "intro": "Eriogonum deflexum subsp. brachypodum, commonly known as the shortpod buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pink. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact pods compared to other varieties of Eriogonum. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. This plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid regions."
