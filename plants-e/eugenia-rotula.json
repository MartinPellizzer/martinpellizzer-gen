    "intro": "Eugenia rotula, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The fruit is a small, round drupe with a thick, leathery skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. The wood of Eugenia rotula is highly valued for its density, durability, and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
