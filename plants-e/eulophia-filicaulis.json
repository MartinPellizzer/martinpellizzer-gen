    "intro": "Eulophia filicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leafed eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its roots are often found in the soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Eulophia filicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings."
