    "intro": "Elongatia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant's leaves are typically a deep green with a waxy surface that helps repel water, while its flowers are showy, with white petals and yellow stamens. Elongatia macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms. Its presence in wetlands and ponds also contributes to water filtration and oxygenation."
