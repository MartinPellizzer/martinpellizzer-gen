    "intro": "Epipactis secundiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a complex structure with a tall, erect stem and a single spike of flowers, often with a distinctive lip. It is a perennial species that reproduces through rhizomes and is pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
