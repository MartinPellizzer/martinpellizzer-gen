    "intro": "Epipactis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with a rosette of basal leaves and a single flowering stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Epipactis micrantha is known for its mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake."
