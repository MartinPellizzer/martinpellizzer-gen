    "intro": "Epidendrum bangii, commonly known as the orchid with golden flowers, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
