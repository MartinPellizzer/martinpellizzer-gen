    "intro": "Elytranthe capitellata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in a dense, rounded inflorescence. Elytranthe capitellata is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
