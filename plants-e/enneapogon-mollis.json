    "intro": "Enneapogon mollis, commonly known as the slender dropseed, is a grass species native to the central and eastern regions of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale brown to reddish-brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and along roadsides. Enneapogon mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
