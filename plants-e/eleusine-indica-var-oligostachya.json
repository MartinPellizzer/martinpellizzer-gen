It features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a short, creeping rhizome. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense growth habit."
