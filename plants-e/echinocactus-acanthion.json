    "intro": "Echinocactus acanthion, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species of cactus native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, horsehair-like spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
