It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that split open to reveal bright orange seeds. Its foliage and fruiting structures make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
