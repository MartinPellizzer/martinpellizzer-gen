    "intro": "Encheiridion, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, showy flowers that bloom on long, sturdy stalks rising from water. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are broad and floating, providing shade and oxygen to the water. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in aquatic environments. The botanical name Encheiridion is derived from the Greek word meaning \"handbook,\" reflecting its historical use in medicinal and spiritual practices."
