    "intro": "Elymus confusus var. pubiflorus, commonly known as the pubiflorous wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and its flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
