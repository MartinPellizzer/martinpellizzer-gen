    "intro": "Eubotryoides grayana var. yezoensis, commonly known as the Yezo Yew, is a variant of the Eubotryoides grayana species native to Japan. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to withstand cold climates and its unique appearance in garden settings."
