    "intro": "Euphorbia leptomyura, commonly known as the slender leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, and its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems and leaves. Euphorbia leptomyura is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
