    "intro": "Elaeagnus tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, edible berries that are rich in nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Elaeagnus tonkinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
