    "intro": "Eria vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic eria, is a unique orchid species native to certain tropical regions. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found near volcanic soils, which provide its specific nutrient requirements. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its growth is closely tied to the microclimates created by volcanic activity. Due to its specialized habitat, Eria vulcanica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
