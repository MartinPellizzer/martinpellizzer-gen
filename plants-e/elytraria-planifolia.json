It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Its leaves are flat and narrow, contributing to its overall grass-like morphology. Elytraria planifolia is often found in open, disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates."
