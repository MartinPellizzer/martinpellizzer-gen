    "intro": "Eriocaulon alpestre var. robustium, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, needle-like leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are typically clustered at the base of the rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This variety is noted for its robust growth compared to other members of the species, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
