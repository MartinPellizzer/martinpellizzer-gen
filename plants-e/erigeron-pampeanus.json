It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of the Pampas region. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, while its flowers are white with a yellow center, attracting various pollinators. Erigeron pampeanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
