    "intro": "Ehrharta triandra, commonly known as common lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Ehrharta triandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control."
