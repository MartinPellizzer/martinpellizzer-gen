    "intro": "Eugenia haematocarpa, commonly known as the bloodwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are sometimes consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively slow growth rate."
