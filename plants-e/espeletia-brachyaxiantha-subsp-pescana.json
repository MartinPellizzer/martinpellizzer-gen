    "intro": "Espeletia brachyaxiantha subsp. pescana, commonly known as the Pescana heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in alpine habitats."
