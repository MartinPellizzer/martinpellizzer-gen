It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Engelmannia has compound leaves with several pairs of lance-shaped leaflets. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
