    "intro": "Erigeron ortegae, commonly known as the Ortegae's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
