    "intro": "Erythrodes schlechteriana, commonly known as the Schlechter's redwood, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in dense forest understories where it receives limited sunlight. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, red berries that serve as a food source for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, Erythrodes schlechteriana is considered a threatened species."
