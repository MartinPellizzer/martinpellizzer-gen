    "intro": "Epidendrum frutex, commonly known as the shrub orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with clustered stems and dense foliage. Its flowers are typically small and come in a variety of colors, often arranged in racemes. Epidendrum frutex thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light."
