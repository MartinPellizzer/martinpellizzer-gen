It features a short, thick stem with numerous spiny, fleshy branches that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
