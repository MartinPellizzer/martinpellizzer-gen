    "intro": "Elymus repens subsp. littoreus, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to maritime environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its seed heads are typically slender and spike-like, appearing in late summer. Coastal bluegrass plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
