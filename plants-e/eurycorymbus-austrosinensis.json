It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, orange fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
