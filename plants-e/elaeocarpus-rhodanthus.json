It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer. The tree produces woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in warm climates."
