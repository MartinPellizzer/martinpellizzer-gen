    "intro": "Euodia volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic euodia, is a rare shrub native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the spring, which are followed by spherical, dark purple berries. Euodia volcanica thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to the high temperatures and low humidity of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research."
