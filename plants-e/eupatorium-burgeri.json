It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Eupatorium burgeri thrives in wetlands and moist soils, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
