It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range."
