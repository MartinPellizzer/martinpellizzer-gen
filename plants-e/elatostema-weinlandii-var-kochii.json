    "intro": "Elatostema weinlandii var. kochii, commonly known as the Koch's elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually fleshy and have a distinctive, almost waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, making it an attractive plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
