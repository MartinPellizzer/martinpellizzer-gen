    "intro": "Erithalis polygama var. timonius, commonly known as the Timonius erithalis, is a variant of the erithalis plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and horticulture."
