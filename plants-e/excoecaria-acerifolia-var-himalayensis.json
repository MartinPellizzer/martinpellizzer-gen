    "intro": "Excoecaria acerifolia var. himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan glorybower, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its striking, maple-like leaves that are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant foliage and seasonal blooms."
