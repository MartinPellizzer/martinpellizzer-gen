    "intro": "Euphorbia livida, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a striking blue-green coloration, which is due to the presence of a waxy cuticle and specialized pigments. The plant has a short, thick stem with multiple branches, and its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are grouped in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia livida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
