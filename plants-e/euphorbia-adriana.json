    "intro": "Euphorbia adriana, commonly known as the Adriatic spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic, so care should be taken when handling it. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia adriana is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
