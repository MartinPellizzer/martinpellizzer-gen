    "intro": "Epistephium praestans var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered epistephium, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value. However, it requires careful cultivation, as it is sensitive to overwatering and prefers well-draining soil."
