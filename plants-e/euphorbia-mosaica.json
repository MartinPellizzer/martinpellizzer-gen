    "intro": "Euphorbia mosaica, commonly known as the mosaic spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by unique, bead-like seed pods. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
