It features a rosette of spiny, blue-gray leaves and produces clusters of spiky, thistle-like blue to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky soils. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient addition to wildflower gardens and ecological restoration projects."
