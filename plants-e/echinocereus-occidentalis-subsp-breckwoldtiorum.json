    "intro": "Echinocereus occidentalis subsp. breckwoldtiorum, commonly known as the Breckwoldt's prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features dense spines that protect it from herbivores and provide shade to the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
