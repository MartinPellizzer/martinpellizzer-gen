    "intro": "Epidendrum amplum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
