    "intro": "Epidendrum moritzii, commonly known as the Moritz's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, warm environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters along its stems. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Epidendrum moritzii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
