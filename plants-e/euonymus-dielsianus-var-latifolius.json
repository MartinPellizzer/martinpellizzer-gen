    "intro": "Euonymus dielsianus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, oval to elliptic leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange capsules that split open to release seeds. Its leaves turn vibrant yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
