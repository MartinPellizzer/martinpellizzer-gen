    "intro": "Euphorbia onoi, commonly known as the Greek spurge or Oni's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia onoi is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
