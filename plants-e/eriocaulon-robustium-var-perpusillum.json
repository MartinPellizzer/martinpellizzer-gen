    "intro": "Eriocaulon robustium var. perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats, making it ecologically significant. The variety perpusillum is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Eriocaulon robustium."
