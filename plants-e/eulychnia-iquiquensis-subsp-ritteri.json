    "intro": "Eulychnia iquiquensis subsp. ritteri, commonly known as the Iquique lichen, is a rare and unique species native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, crust-like growth form. The thallus is typically pale grey to yellowish, with a dense, compact structure that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. This lichen is often found in arid, coastal environments where it thrives in low-nutrient, saline soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
