    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale subsp. affine, commonly known as the slender horse tail, is a flowering plant species that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a distinctive, hollow stem. This subspecies is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. The plant produces spore-bearing strobila, which are cone-like structures that contribute to its reproductive cycle. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
