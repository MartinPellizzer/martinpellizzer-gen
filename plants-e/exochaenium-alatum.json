    "intro": "Exochaenium alatum, commonly known as the winged grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed capsules, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Exochaenium alatum is often found in open, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
