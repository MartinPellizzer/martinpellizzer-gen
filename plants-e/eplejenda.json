    "intro": "Eplejenda, commonly known as the \"false heather,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact, evergreen shrubs with dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, and the flowers come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and red. Eplejenda species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and are adapted to well-drained, acidic soils. They thrive in full sun to partial shade and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
