    "intro": "Euphorbia schubei, commonly known as the Schubert's spurges, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are fleshy and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia schubei is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
