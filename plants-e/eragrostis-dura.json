    "intro": "Eragrostis dura, commonly known as rigid lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eragrostis dura is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. Its ecological significance includes providing forage for livestock and stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
