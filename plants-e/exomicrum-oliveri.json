    "intro": "Exomicrum oliveri, commonly known as the Oliver's exomicrum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its small, palmate leaves and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
