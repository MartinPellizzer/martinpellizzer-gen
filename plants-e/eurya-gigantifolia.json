    "intro": "Eurya gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant evergreen holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including China, India, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with glossy dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Eurya gigantifolia thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forest understories where it forms dense thickets."
