    "intro": "Euonymus hypoleucus, commonly known as the white-fruited woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive white, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures. Euonymus hypoleucus is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade."
