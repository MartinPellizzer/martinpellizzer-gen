    "intro": "Eria gibbsiae, commonly known as the Gibbs' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Eria gibbsiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
