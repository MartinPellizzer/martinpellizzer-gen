    "intro": "Euphorbia gemmea, commonly known as the gemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
