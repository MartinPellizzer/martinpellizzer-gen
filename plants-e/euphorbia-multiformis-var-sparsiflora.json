    "intro": "Euphorbia multiformis var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparsiflora euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a compact growth habit with thick, ribbed stems that can develop a reddish hue under intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
