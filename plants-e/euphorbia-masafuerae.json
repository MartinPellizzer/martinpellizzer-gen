    "intro": "Euphorbia masafuerae, commonly known as the Masafuera euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
