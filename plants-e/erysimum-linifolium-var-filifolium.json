    "intro": "Erysimum linifolium var. filifolium, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures that attach to the roots of its host. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and appear in clusters, adding visual interest to its habitat. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
