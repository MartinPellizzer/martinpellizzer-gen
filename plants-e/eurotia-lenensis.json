    "intro": "Eurotia lenensis, commonly known as the Lenensian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. Eurotia lenensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
