    "intro": "Eumecanthus colimae, commonly known as the Mexican redwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its tall, evergreen tree form with a straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
