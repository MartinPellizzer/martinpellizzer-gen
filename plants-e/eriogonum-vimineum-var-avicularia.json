    "intro": "Eriogonum vimineum var. avicularia, commonly known as the slender buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its wiry, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
