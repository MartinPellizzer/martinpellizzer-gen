    "intro": "Eulophia sabulosa, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. The plant produces slender, hairy pseudobulbs that bear a single, narrow leaf. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, spurred labellum, and they are arranged in a raceme. Eulophia sabulosa thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
