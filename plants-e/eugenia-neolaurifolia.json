    "intro": "Eugenia neolaurifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
