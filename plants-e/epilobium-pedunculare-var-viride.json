    "intro": "Epilobium pedunculare var. viride, commonly known as green-stem willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and roadside areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
