It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, ball-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive winter bark and early spring flowering."
