    "intro": "Euphorbia bancana, commonly known as the Banka spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a distinctive stem structure with thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia bancana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
