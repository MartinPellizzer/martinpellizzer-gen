    "intro": "Epistylium cauliflorum, commonly known as the cauliflower epistylium, is a colonial calcareous alga found in marine environments. It forms dense, bushy colonies that often attach to substrates such as shells or other algae. The plant exhibits a unique cauliflorous growth pattern, where new branches develop from the base of the colony rather than the tips. Its structure consists of a central axis with lateral branches covered in small, rounded protuberances. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
