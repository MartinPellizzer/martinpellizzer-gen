    "intro": "Euacer obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed euacer, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves with rounded lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to moist forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
