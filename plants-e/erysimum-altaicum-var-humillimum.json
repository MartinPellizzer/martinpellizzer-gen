    "intro": "Erysimum altaicum var. humillimum, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and on slopes, where it forms dense mats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
