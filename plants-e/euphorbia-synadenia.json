    "intro": "Euphorbia synadenia, commonly known as the golden cup euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features a woody stem with a distinctive, cup-shaped structure at the top, which houses the plant's unique floral inflorescence. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized structures containing both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Euphorbia synadenia is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
