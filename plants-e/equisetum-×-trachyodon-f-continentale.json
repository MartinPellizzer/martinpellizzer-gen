    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon f. continentale, commonly known as the European horsetail, is a hybrid fern-like plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of spore-bearing branches. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its hollow, jointed stems that resemble those of its ancestral relatives. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This species is adapted to temperate climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience."
