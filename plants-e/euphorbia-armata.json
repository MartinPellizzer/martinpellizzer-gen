    "intro": "Euphorbia armata, commonly known as the armed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in small, stiff spines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive drought. Euphorbia armata is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
