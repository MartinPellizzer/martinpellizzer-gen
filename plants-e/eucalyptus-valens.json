    "intro": "Eucalyptus valens, commonly known as the lemon-scented gum, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong lemon-like fragrance. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus valens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to a range of environmental conditions."
