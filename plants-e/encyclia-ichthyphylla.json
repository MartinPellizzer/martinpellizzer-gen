    "intro": "Encyclia ichthyphylla, commonly known as the fish-scale orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its distinctive, fish-scale-like leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia ichthyphylla is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
