    "intro": "Eberhardtia, commonly known as the Mexican white bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds are often used in traditional cuisines for their nutty flavor and high protein content. Botanically, Eberhardtia is characterized by its compound leaves and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
