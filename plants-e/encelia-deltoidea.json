It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has silvery-gray leaves and produces yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its foliage is adapted to reduce water loss, featuring small, waxy leaves. Encelia deltoidea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
