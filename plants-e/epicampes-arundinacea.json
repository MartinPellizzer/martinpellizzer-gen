    "intro": "Epicampes arundinacea, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to wetland areas in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in wet meadows. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in non-native regions."
