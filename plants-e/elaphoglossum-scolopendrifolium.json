    "intro": "Elaphoglossum scolopendrifolium, commonly known as the thread-veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping in growth habit. The plant features small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it a notable species within its native habitat."
