    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoapios, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
