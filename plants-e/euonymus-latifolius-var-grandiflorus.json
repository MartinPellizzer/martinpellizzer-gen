    "intro": "Euonymus latifolius var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the glossy abutilon, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and red, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its striking floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
