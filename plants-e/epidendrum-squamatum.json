    "intro": "Epidendrum squamatum, commonly known as the velvet epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to both greenhouse and garden settings."
