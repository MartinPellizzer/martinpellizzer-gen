    "intro": "Eugenia dumosa, commonly known as the rough eucalyptus, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, dark blue to black berries. Eugenia dumosa is often found in open forests and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Indigenous practices."
