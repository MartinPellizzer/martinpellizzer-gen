It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled capsules, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Eremanthus janivultus is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
