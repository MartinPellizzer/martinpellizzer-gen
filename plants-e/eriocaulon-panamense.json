    "intro": "Eriocaulon panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian spikegrass, is a small herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, which includes various aquatic and semi-aquatic grasses. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eriocaulon panamense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
