    "intro": "Ericoides fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal environments. Ericoides fastigiatum is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
