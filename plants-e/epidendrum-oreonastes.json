    "intro": "Epidendrum oreonastes, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils, adapting to harsh, sunny environments. Its roots are fibrous and often form a network that helps stabilize the rocky substrate. Epidendrum oreonastes is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
