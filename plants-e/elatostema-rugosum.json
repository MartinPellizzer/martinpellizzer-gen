    "intro": "Elatostema rugosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or ovate, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Elatostema rugosum produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences."
