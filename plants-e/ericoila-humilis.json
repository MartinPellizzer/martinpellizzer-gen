    "intro": "Ericoila humilis, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Ericoila humilis is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
