    "intro": "Erica australis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western heath, is a shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray. This species is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
