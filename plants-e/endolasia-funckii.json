    "intro": "Endolasia funckii, commonly known as the Funck's endolasia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Endolasia funckii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
