    "intro": "Eriophorum latifolium var. ramosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved cotton grass, is a flowering plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced after the plant has bloomed. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in poorly drained soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette near the ground. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
