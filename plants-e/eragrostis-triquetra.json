    "intro": "Eragrostis triquetra, commonly known as three-angled grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
