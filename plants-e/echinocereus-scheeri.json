It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, spherical flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in white to pale blue spines. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
