    "intro": "Euphorbia stenomeres, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia stenomeres is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought conditions. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
