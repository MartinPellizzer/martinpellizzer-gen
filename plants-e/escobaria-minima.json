    "intro": "Escobaria minima, commonly known as the dwarf liveforever, is a small, evergreen succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, typical of desert-adapted plants. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Escobaria minima is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
