    "intro": "Eurya japonica f. australis, commonly known as the southern Japanese eurya, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments."
