    "intro": "Erica cordata var. arachnoidea, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage that is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a landscape plant."
