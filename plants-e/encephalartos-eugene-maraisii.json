    "intro": "Encephalartos eugene-maraisii, commonly known as the Eugene-Marais cycad, is a rare and endangered species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate with mild temperatures. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
