    "intro": "Elytrigia repens var. vaillantiana, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its dense, compact growth."
