    "intro": "Echinopsis herzogiana, commonly known as the Herzog's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its globular shape and a dense covering of white spines that give it a unique, moon-like appearance. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. Echinopsis herzogiana is also valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in arid environments and its resilience to drought."
