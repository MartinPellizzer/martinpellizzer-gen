It features a distinctive, swollen stem that often branches into a shrub-like form. The leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
