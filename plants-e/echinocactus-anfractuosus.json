    "intro": "Echinocactus anfractuosus, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant's unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections."
