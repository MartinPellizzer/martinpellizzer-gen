    "intro": "Eustachya sibirica, commonly known as Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a blue-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture. Eustachya sibirica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid regions."
