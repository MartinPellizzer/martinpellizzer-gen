    "intro": "Eschweilera iquitosensis, commonly known as the Iquitos starfruit, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the common starfruit. Eschweilera iquitosensis is typically found in humid, lowland tropical forests and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
