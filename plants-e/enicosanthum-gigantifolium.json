    "intro": "Enicosanthum gigantifolium, commonly known as the giant-leafed enicosanthum, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its enormous, leathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, making it one of the largest leaf plants in the world. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
