    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris subsp. globularis, commonly known as the globular spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its cylindrical stems are often reddish in color, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
