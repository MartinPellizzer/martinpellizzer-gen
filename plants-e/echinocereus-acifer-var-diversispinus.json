    "intro": "Echinocereus acifer var. diversispinus, commonly known as the variegated hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spineless cactus with a compact, globular shape and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted for drought tolerance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and bats."
