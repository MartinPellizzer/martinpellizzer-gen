    "intro": "Eriogonum pharnaceoides, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Eriogonum pharnaceoides plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
