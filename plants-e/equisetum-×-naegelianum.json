    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 naegelianum, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its primitive features, it is considered one of the oldest living seedless vascular plants."
