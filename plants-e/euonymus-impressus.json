    "intro": "Euonymus impressus, commonly known as the smooth euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a ornamental hedge or ground cover. Euonymus impressus is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial to full shade."
