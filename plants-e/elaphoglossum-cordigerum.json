    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cordigerum, commonly known as the heart-shaped water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum cordigerum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
