    "intro": "Eurya emarginata var. minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf eurya, is a compact shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, shade-tolerant plant."
