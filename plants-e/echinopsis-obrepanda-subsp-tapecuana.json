    "intro": "Echinopsis obrepanda subsp. tapecuana, commonly known as the Tapecuana cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Bolivia. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
