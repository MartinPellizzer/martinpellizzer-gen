    "intro": "Elaphoglossum agostinii, commonly known as the Agostini's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Elaphoglossum agostinii is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
