    "intro": "Euphorbia preslii, commonly known as the Preslia's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green and sometimes tinged with red. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a unique cyathium structure, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
