    "intro": "Epipactis palustris lusus tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower that typically displays three distinct colors: yellow, green, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. The species is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, attracting specific insects with its unique floral structure."
