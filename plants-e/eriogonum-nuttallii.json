    "intro": "Eriogonum nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its clustered inflorescences of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum nuttallii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
