    "intro": "Echinocactus corrugatus, commonly known as the corrugated hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a slow-growing cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and prominent spines. The plant typically produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
