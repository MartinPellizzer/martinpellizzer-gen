It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which range from elongated to broad and lobed, adapting to various environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often hairy, providing some protection against herbivores and extreme weather. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological variation and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
