    "intro": "Erianthemum, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Erianthemum species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. They are also drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
