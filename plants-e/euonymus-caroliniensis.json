    "intro": "Euonymus caroliniensis, commonly known as the Carolina beauty or red-edged leaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often reddish-edged, especially on younger foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
