    "intro": "Epipactis duriensis, commonly known as the rough helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a tall, erect flowering stem that bears several showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Epipactis duriensis is a perennial species that produces a single flower per stem, which is often adorned with a distinctive, hood-like structure. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
