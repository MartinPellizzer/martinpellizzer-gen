    "intro": "Elsholtzia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow linear leaves covered in fine hairs, and clusters of small, fragrant, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a desirable ornamental plant in dry landscapes. Elsholtzia pubescens is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
