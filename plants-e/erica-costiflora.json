    "intro": "Erica costiflora, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Erica costiflora thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
