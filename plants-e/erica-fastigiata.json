    "intro": "Erica fastigiata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and full sun to partial shade. Erica fastigiata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
