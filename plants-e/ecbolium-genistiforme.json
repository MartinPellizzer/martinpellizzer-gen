    "intro": "Ecbolium genistiforme, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Ecbolium genistiforme is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion in its native habitats."
