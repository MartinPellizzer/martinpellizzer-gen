    "intro": "Elymus caesius, commonly known as bluegrass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hair. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Elymus caesius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
