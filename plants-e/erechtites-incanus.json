    "intro": "Erechtites incanus, commonly known as the white coneflower, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that resembles a dandelion, which aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs. Erechtites incanus thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands."
