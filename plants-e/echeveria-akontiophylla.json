It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces vibrant pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its compact shape. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
