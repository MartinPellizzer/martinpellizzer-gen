    "intro": "Euonymus crinitus var. minor, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red-orange berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
