    "intro": "Elytrigia heidemaniae, commonly known as the Heidemann's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
