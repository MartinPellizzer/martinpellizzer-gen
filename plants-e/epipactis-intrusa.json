    "intro": "Epipactis intrusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and striking, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. Epipactis intrusa is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is often found in calcareous soils."
