    "intro": "Eucalyptus surgens, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a tall, slender tree native to the wetter regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that ranges from grey to white in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a grey-green hue with a rough upper surface. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom during the spring and summer months. The plant is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streamlines."
