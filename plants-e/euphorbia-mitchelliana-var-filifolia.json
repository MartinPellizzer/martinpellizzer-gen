    "intro": "Euphorbia mitchelliana var. filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, thread-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a distinctive addition to xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
