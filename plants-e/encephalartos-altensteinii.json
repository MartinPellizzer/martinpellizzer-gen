    "intro": "Encephalartos altensteinii, commonly known as the Altenstein\u2019s cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a dry climate, making it a hardy but specialized species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
