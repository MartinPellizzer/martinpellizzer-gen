    "intro": "Escobaria sneedii subsp. organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States. It features a low-growing, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in rocky soils of the Organ Mountains."
