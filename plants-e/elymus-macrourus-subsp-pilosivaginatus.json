    "intro": "Elymus macrourus subsp. pilosivaginatus, commonly known as the hairy sheath wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves with a distinctive hairy sheath at the base. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
