    "intro": "Erodium incarnatum, commonly known as redstem sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in dry environments."
