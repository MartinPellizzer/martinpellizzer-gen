    "intro": "Erica carnea var. alba, commonly known as white heather, is a flowering plant native to the western Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Erica carnea var. alba is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
