It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest in botanical research."
