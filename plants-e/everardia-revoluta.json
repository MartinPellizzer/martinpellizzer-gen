    "intro": "Everardia revoluta, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots, known as pneumatophores, which help it breathe in oxygen-poor tidal soils. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and attract various pollinators. Everardia revoluta plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
