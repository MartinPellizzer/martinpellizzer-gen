    "intro": "Eugenia parva, commonly known as the dwarf guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit, a small, round berry, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Eugenia parva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and year-round foliage."
