It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often found in Mediterranean regions. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to greenish flowers. Its fruits are distinctive, with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Echinella uncinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
