    "intro": "Erythroxylum martii, commonly known as the Mexican chili pepper or red pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its small, bright red berries that contain alkaloids, including cathinone. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the psychoactive properties of its fruits. However, due to its potential for misuse, it is regulated in many regions."
