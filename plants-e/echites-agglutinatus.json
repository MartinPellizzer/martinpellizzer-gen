    "intro": "Echites agglutinatus, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known species like tomatoes and peppers. Its fruits are typically small berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. The sticky resin it exudes is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxicity."
