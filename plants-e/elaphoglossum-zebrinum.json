    "intro": "Elaphoglossum zebrinum, commonly known as the zebra fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive zebra-like pattern of light and dark green on the underside. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Elaphoglossum zebrinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
