    "intro": "Echinocereus stolonifer var. tayopensis, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Texas and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of spiny, paddle-shaped stems that grow along the ground. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and commonly used in local cuisines. This cactus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
