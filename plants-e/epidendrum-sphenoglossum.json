    "intro": "Epidendrum sphenoglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, leaf-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
