    "intro": "Echinocarpus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan burr, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit, which is a dry, spiny capsule, plays a role in seed dispersal through its prickly exterior."
