    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis proles pinea, commonly known as the Pineapple Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to xeriscaping efforts."
