    "intro": "Erythroxylum ficifolium, commonly known as the fig-leaf coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of a fig tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elliptical, woody fruits. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids like cocaine. However, it is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes and traditional use in some indigenous cultures."
