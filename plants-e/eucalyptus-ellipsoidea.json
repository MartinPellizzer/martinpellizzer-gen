    "intro": "Eucalyptus ellipsoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree form, with smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow and elliptical, often with a greyish-green hue, and they are covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, woody capsules as fruit. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
