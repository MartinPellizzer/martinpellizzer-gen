    "intro": "Elytrigia armena, commonly known as Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate and alpine climates. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue. Elytrigia armena is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging environments."
