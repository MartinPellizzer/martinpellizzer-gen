    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli f. longiseta, commonly known as the long-hairy barnyard grass, is a variant of the common barnyard grass. It is a grass species native to the warmer regions of the world and is often found in disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its long, stiff hairs on the stem and leaves, which distinguish it from other similar grasses. It grows as an annual plant, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
