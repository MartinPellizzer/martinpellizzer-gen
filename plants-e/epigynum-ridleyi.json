    "intro": "Epigynum ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's epigynum, is a rare and specialized plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique botanical features, including its compound leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, often utilizing its tendrils to support itself on other vegetation. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically arranged in umbellate clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries as its fruit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Epigynum ridleyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
