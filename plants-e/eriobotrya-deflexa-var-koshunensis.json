    "intro": "Eriobotrya deflexa var. koshunensis, commonly known as the Koshun apple tree, is a variant of the eriobotrya genus native to Japan. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, red to orange fruits resembling apples. The fruits are typically harvested in late summer and are valued for their sweet, aromatic flavor. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for both its beauty and fruit production."
