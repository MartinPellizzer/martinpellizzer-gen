    "intro": "Ectasis placentiflora, commonly known as the placenta-flowered ectasis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a placenta, with clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and emits a faint, sweet fragrance during the evening hours. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Ectasis placentiflora is considered a vulnerable species."
