    "intro": "Euphrasia coreanalpina, commonly known as the Alpine eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across high-altitude habitats. Euphrasia coreanalpina is often found in open meadows and grasslands, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance."
