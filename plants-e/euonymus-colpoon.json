    "intro": "Euonymus colpoon, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, making it a plant of both aesthetic and ecological interest."
