It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a woody, spherical drupe with a sticky outer layer, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
