    "intro": "Eurya euprista, commonly known as the red-leaf eurya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Eurya euprista is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
