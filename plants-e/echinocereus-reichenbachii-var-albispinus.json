    "intro": "Echinocereus reichenbachii var. albispinus, commonly known as the white spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring white spines that contrast with its green to blue-green stem. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively easy to care for, though it requires minimal water to prevent root rot."
