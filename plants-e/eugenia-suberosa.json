It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark red to black berries that are encased in a thick, white rind. The plant typically grows in wet, lowland areas and has glossy, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and white or pink, often clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is valued for its sweet, tangy pulp and is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
