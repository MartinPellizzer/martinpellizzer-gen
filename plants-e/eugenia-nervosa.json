    "intro": "Eugenia nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with prominent veins and its clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenia nervosa is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
