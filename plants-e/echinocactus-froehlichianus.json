    "intro": "Echinocactus froehlichianus, commonly known as the Froehlich's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and desert gardeners."
