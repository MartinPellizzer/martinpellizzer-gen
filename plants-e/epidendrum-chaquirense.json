    "intro": "Epidendrum chaquirense, commonly known as the Chaquirens orchid, is a species native to Central America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth, waxy texture. Epidendrum chaquirense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
