    "intro": "Epidendrum pergameneum, commonly known as the Parchment Epidendrum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy, parchment-like coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with flowers that are typically yellow or green with red or orange markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pergameneum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
