    "intro": "Eragrostis polytricha var. hirsutior, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a variant of the annual grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more prominent as the plant matures. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
