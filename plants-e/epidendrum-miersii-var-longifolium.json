    "intro": "Epidendrum miersii var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warm season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
