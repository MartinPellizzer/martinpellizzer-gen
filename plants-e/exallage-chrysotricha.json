    "intro": "Exallage chrysotricha, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky, golden-colored trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. Exallage chrysotricha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing grass for landscaping."
