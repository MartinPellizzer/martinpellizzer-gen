    "intro": "Euphorbia taxifolia, commonly known as the \"Tree Spurge,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy, greenish-gray layer. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid climates. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
