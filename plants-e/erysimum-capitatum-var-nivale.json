    "intro": "Erysimum capitatum var. nivale, commonly known as the snowflake mustard, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces long, slender seed pods that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Its frost-resistant nature makes it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders in colder climates."
