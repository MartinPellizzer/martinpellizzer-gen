    "intro": "Eucalyptus diversifolia subsp. megacarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and grey. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
