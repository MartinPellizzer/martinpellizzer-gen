It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its foliage is usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, white to pale blue flowers in the summer months. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient wildflower in desert ecosystems."
