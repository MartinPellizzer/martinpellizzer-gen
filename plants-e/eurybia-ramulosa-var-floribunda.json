    "intro": "Eurybia ramulosa var. floribunda, commonly known as the showy goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow floral heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with slender, branching stems and finely divided, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are arranged in panicles, which are open, branched clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
