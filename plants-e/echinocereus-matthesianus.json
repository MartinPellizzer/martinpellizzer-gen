    "intro": "Echinocereus matthesianus, commonly known as the Matthesian cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-gray in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
