The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, aiding in its spread across aquatic habitats. Eleocharis acicularis var. acicularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
