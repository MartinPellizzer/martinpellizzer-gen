    "intro": "Erodium nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and sunny environments. The plant features slender stems and small, opposite leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. Its flowers are pink to reddish in color, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Erodium nervosum is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open habitats where it can thrive in poor soil conditions."
