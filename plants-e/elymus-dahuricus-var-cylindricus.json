    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus var. cylindricus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
