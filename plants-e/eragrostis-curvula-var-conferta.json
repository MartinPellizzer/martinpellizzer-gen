It is characterized by its dense, fountain-like growth habit with long, arching leaves that give it a soft, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish to brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control in suitable climates."
