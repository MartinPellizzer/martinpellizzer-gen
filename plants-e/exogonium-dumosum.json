    "intro": "Exogonium dumosum, commonly known as the dense-stemmed herb, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody, branching stems that often form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Exogonium dumosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
