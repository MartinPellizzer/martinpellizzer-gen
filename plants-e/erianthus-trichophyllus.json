    "intro": "Erianthus trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy lemmas grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a hairy texture on the lower surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Erianthus trichophyllus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for erosion control and as a forage plant."
