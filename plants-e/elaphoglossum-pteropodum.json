    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pteropodum, commonly known as the broad-veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize shaded forest floors. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae and a distinct, often broad midrib. Elaphoglossum pteropodum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
