    "intro": "Eugenia polycarpa var. marginata, commonly known as the marginated myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that have a distinctive white or pale green margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. The varietal form 'marginata' is distinguished by its unique leaf margin coloration, which sets it apart from other Eugenia species."
