    "intro": "Epithelantha greggii subsp. polycephala, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. It produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals, providing a natural defense mechanism. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaping gardens."
