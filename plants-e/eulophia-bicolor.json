    "intro": "Eulophia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored eulophia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly contrasting green and white flowers, which are often arranged in a raceme. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract various pollinators. Eulophia bicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
