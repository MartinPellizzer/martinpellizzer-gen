    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum var. virgatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, quadrangular stems and lance-shaped, often hairy leaves. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
