    "intro": "Epidendrum niveocaligarium, commonly known as the Snowy Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white to pale blue flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has fibrous roots and thrives in moist, well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Epidendrum niveocaligarium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
