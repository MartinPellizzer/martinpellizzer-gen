    "intro": "Epidendrum odontorhizon, commonly known as the toothed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
