    "intro": "Erysimum pallescens, commonly known as the pale erinacea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain seeds. Erysimum pallescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
