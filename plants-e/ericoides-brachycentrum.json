    "intro": "Ericoides brachycentrum, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the moist, acidic soils of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically produces white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are often borne on short, erect stalks. Its compact form and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Ericoides brachycentrum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
