    "intro": "Eucalyptus trinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are typically narrow and have three distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. Eucalyptus trinervis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils."
