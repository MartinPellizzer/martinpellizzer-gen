It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
