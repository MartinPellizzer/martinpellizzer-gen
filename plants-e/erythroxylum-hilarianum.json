    "intro": "Erythroxylum hilarianum, commonly known as the Amazonian coca, is a shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elliptical, reddish-brown capsules containing seeds. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine, in its leaves. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is both economically significant and subject to strict legal regulation."
