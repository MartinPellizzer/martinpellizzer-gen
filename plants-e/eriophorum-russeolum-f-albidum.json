    "intro": "Eriophorum russeolum f. albidum, commonly known as the white cottongrass, is a botanical variant of the common cottongrass. It is characterized by its pale, almost white inflorescences, which distinguish it from the typical greenish or brownish forms of the species. This plant is typically found in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It has a low-growing habit with slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
