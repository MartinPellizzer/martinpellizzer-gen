    "intro": "Equisetum majus var. serotinum, commonly known as the late spore fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically released in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland areas. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
