    "intro": "Euodia kavaiensis, commonly known as Kava kava, is a shrub native to the South Pacific islands. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the presence of a unique alkaloid compound called kavalactone, which contributes to its traditional use in ceremonial and medicinal contexts. Euodia kavaiensis thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
