    "intro": "Euryops subcarnosus subsp. foetidus, commonly known as the stinking bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is characterized by its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions."
