    "intro": "Echinocactus sellowii f. martini, commonly known as the Sellow's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Brazil. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with prominent, sharp spines that are typically red or orange in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiky structure. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. This cultivar is valued for its unique appearance and is often grown as a decorative houseplant or in rock gardens."
