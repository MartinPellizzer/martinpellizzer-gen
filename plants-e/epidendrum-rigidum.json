    "intro": "Epidendrum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, slender stems that often bear clusters of pendulous flowers. The plant typically produces showy, brightly colored blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum rigidum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
