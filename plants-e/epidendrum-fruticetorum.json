    "intro": "Epidendrum fruticetorum, commonly known as the shrub orchid, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum fruticetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
