    "intro": "Elytrigia argentea, commonly known as silver wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, silver-blue leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
