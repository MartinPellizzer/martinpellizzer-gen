It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and its distinctive, snake-like appearance due to its elongated, curling leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique lip that is often curved and resembles a snake's head. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. This orchid is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and is often found in association with other orchid species."
