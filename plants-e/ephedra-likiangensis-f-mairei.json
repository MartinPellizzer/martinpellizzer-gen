    "intro": "Ephedra likiangensis f. mairei, commonly known as the Yunnan ephedra, is a subspecies of the ephedra plant native to China. It is a small shrub characterized by its jointed, woody stems and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to the presence of ephedrine."
