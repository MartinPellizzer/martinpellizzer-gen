    "intro": "Euphorbia dubovikiae, commonly known as the Dubovikov's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap, which can be toxic. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
