    "intro": "Elatine californica, commonly known as the California water starwort, is a small, aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has small, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, star-shaped flowers. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich waters, making it an indicator of environmental change. Elatine californica plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is important for water quality monitoring."
