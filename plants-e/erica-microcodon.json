    "intro": "Erica microcodon, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its dense foliage and compact form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica microcodon is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its resilience to drought and coastal conditions."
