    "intro": "Epidendrum labiatum var. lemonianum, commonly known as the Lemon-leaf Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often a vibrant green with a slight yellowish tinge. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
