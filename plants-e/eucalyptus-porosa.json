    "intro": "Eucalyptus porosa, commonly known as the slender honey gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green upper surface. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
