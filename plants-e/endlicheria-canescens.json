    "intro": "Endlicheria canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
