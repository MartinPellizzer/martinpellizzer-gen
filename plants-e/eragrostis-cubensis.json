    "intro": "Eragrostis cubensis, commonly known as Cuban lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Eragrostis cubensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
