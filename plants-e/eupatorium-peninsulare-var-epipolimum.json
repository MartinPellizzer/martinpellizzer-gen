    "intro": "Eupatorium peninsulare var. epipolimum, commonly known as the Florida boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clustered umbels, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet or moist habitats. The species is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
