    "intro": "Euphorbia caesia, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically appearing in late spring. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a distinguishing feature of the genus Euphorbia. Euphorbia caesia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions."
