    "intro": "Epiphyllum russellianum, commonly known as the Russell's night bloomer, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is a climbing epiphytic cactus native to Central America, particularly Mexico. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. Its stems are flattened and jointed, often used for propagation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
