    "intro": "Euclea crispa subsp. crispa, commonly known as the Grey Stinkwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears grey or brown, and its small, elliptical leaves that are usually pale green and hairy beneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, cylindrical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
