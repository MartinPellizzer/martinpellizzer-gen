    "intro": "Erisma maliforme, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Erisma maliforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
