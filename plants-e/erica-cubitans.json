    "intro": "Erica cubitans, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, usually blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica cubitans is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
