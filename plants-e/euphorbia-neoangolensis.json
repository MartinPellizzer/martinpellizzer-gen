    "intro": "Euphorbia neoangolensis, commonly known as the Angola spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
