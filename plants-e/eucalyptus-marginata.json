    "intro": "Eucalyptus marginata, commonly known as the white gum, is a tall evergreen tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent white midrib. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules that contain aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland forest communities."
