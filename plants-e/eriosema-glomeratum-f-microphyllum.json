    "intro": "Eriosema glomeratum f. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf eriosema, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
