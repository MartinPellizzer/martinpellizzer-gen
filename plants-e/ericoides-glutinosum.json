    "intro": "Ericoides glutinosum, commonly known as sticky erica, is a low-growing shrub native to the wet heathlands of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires high levels of sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
