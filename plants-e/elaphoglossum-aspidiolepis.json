    "intro": "Elaphoglossum aspidiolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum aspidiolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
