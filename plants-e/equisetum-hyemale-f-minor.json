    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are typically less than 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila at the apex of its stems, which are often green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands. This variety is notable for its primitive features and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
