    "intro": "Eucalyptus melanophloia subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf grey box, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue when young, turning grey-green with age. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands."
