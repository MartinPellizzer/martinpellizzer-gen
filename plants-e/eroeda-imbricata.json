    "intro": "Eroeda imbricata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in crevices and on cliffs, where it can withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. Eroeda imbricata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small organisms in its native range."
