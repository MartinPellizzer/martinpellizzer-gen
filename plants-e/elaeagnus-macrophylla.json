    "intro": "Elaeagnus macrophylla, commonly known as the silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and compound leaves with silvery-white stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet berries that ripen in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The silverberry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
