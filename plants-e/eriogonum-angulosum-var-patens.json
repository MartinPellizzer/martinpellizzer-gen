It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a compact growth habit and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness."
