    "intro": "Eriosyce curvispina var. lissocarpa, commonly known as the woolly cactus or the hairy cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to light brown hairs, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and desiccation. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with multiple branches, forming a rounded or bushy shape. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils with minimal water requirements."
