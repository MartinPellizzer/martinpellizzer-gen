    "intro": "Elmera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae, which includes species like willowherb and evening primrose. Elmera is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is also noted for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that last only a few hours. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Elmera is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
