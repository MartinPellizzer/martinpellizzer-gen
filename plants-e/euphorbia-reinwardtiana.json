    "intro": "Euphorbia reinwardtiana, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus and can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
