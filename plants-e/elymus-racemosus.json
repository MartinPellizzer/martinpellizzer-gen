    "intro": "Elymus racemosus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Elymus racemosus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
