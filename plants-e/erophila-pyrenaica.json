    "intro": "Erophila pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erophila pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands."
