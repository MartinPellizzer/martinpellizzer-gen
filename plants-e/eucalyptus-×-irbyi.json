    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 irbyi, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, usually pink or pale red, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Eucalyptus \u00d7 irbyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and along coastal areas for its hardiness and aesthetic features."
