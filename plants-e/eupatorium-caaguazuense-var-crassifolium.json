    "intro": "Eupatorium caaguazuense var. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
