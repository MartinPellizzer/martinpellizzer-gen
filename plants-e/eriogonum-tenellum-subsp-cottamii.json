    "intro": "Eriogonum tenellum subsp. cottamii, commonly known as the Cottam's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to harsh conditions."
