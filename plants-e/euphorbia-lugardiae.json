    "intro": "Euphorbia lugardiae, commonly known as the Lugard's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
