    "intro": "Euphorbia richardsiae, commonly known as the Richards' spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions. Euphorbia richardsiae is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
