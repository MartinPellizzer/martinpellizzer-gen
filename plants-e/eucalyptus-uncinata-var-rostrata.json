It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules that contain aromatic seeds. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses by Indigenous communities."
