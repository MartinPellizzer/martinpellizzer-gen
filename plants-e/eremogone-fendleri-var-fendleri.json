    "intro": "Eremogone fendleri var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and radially symmetrical, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds."
