It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and tufted inflorescences that resemble a cluster of wires. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and can thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Additionally, it serves as a food source for certain herbivores and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
