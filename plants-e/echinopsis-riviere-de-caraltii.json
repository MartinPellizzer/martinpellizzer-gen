It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
