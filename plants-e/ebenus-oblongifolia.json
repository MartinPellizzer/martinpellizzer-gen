    "intro": "Ebenus oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Ebenus oblongifolia is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops."
