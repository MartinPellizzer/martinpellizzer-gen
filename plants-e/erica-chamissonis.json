It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Erica chamissonis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
