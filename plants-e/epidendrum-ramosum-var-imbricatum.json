    "intro": "Epidendrum ramosum var. imbricatum, commonly known as the Variegated Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy surface, and it thrives in well-draining potting mix with regular watering. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
