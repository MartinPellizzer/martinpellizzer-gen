    "intro": "Eucalyptus nigrifunda, commonly known as the black-veined eucalypt, is a species native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is a tall tree, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. The leaves are long and narrow, with a distinctive dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, clustered in umbels, and are pollinated by insects. The plant is valued for its timber and has some medicinal uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other eucalypt species."
