It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with narrow, woody stems and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry climates."
