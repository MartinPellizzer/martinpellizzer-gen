    "intro": "Erythrina mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican coral tree, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a flat, woody pod that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Erythrina mexicana is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its tolerance to drought conditions."
