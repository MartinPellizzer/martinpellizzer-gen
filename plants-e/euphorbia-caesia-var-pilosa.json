    "intro": "Euphorbia caesia var. pilosa, commonly known as the wooly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique texture and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
