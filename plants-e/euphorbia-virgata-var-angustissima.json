    "intro": "Euphorbia virgata var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
