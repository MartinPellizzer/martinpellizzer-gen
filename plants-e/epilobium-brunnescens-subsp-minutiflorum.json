    "intro": "Epilobium brunnescens subsp. minutiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, riverbanks, and damp meadows. The plant features lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with five pink or reddish-purple petals. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to thrive in wet or poorly drained conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Epilobium brunnescens."
