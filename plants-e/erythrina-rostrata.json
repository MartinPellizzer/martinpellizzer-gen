    "intro": "Erythrina rostrata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical legume native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three leaflets, and its bark is smooth and often reddish in color. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Erythrina rostrata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to its ecological importance in certain regions."
