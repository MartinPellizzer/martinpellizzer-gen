    "intro": "Echinopsis densispina var. rebutioides, commonly known as the Rebutia-like Echinopsis, is a cacti species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
