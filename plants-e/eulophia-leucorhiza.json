    "intro": "Eulophia leucorhiza, commonly known as the white-rooted eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate."
