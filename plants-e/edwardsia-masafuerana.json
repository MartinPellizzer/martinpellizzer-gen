    "intro": "Edwardsia masafuerana, commonly known as the Masafuera sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps to reduce water loss. Edwardsia masafuerana plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
