    "intro": "Ericoides fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage composed of small, leathery leaves with a distinctive fringed margin. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides fimbriatum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
