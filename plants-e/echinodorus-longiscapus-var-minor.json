It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant thrives in slow to moderately flowing freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas quickly. It is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
