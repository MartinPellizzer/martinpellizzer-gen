    "intro": "Elaphoglossum barteri, commonly known as the Barter's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum barteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
