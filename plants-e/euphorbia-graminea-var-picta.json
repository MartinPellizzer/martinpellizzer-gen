    "intro": "Euphorbia graminea var. picta, commonly known as the Variegated Milkweed Euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features upright, slender stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive variegation pattern of green and white. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and unique aesthetic."
