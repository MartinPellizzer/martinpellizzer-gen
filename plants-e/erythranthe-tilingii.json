    "intro": "Erythranthe tilingii, commonly known as the Tiling's monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland areas. The plant produces showy, orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Erythranthe tilingii is part of the Phrymaceae family and is noted for its ecological importance as a food source for various pollinators."
