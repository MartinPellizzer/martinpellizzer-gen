    "intro": "Erblichia odorata, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that emit a sweet, floral fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by insects and birds due to their vibrant colors and aromatic scent."
