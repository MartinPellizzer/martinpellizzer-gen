    "intro": "Eriosema holophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf eriosema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture due to dense pubescence. Eriosema holophyllum is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
