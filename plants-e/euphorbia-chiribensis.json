    "intro": "Euphorbia chiribensis, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia chiribensis is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
