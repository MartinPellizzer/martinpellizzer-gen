    "intro": "Euphorbia kundelunguensis, commonly known as the Kundelungu euphorbia, is a spiny, succulent shrub native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It features a thick, branching stem covered in sharp, yellowish spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a unique structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. This species is also noted for its slow growth and ability to store water in its stem, making it resilient in harsh conditions."
