    "intro": "Eurya grandis, commonly known as the Chinese holly or red-leafed holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn bright red in the autumn, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Eurya grandis is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide seasonal color in the landscape."
