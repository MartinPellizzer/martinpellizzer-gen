    "intro": "Ellipeiopsis cherrevensis, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
