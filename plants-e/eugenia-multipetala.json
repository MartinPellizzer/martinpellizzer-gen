    "intro": "Eugenia multipetala, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or pink guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its ornamental value due to its showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture with a glossy appearance. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red when mature, and it is edible, though not widely cultivated for commercial use."
