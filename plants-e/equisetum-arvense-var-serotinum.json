    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. serotinum, commonly known as the late fern or field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This variety is distinguished by its delayed flowering, typically occurring in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant contains silica, which gives it a gritty texture and makes it difficult to consume."
