    "intro": "Epipetrum polyanthes, commonly known as the silver velvet plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring dense, fleshy, and often silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
