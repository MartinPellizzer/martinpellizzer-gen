    "intro": "Eriogonum kennedyi subsp. alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant thrives in high-elevation environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various small animals."
