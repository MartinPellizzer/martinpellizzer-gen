    "intro": "Epipactis microphylla f. canescens, commonly known as the hairy-leaved helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip that is usually darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
