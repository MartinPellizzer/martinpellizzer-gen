    "intro": "Epidendrum portokalium, commonly known as the Orange Flame Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It features vibrant orange and yellow flowers that bloom in pendulous clusters, adding a striking visual display. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
