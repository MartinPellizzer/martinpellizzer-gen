It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
