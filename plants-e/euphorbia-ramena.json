    "intro": "Euphorbia ramena, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought conditions. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
