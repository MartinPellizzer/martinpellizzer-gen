    "intro": "Empusa, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant found in specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. Empusa has a unique root system that filters out toxins, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its blooming cycle is closely tied to lunar phases, making it a subject of fascination among botanists and folklore enthusiasts alike."
