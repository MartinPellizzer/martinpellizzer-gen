It features a compact, rounded shape with smooth, thick, fleshy stems that can be green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
