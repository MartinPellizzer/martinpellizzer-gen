    "intro": "Engelhardia roxburghiana f. brevialata, commonly known as the short-stemmed engelhardia, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Theaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced stem length compared to the typical form of Engelhardia roxburghiana. The leaves are usually elliptical, with a smooth surface and a glossy appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
