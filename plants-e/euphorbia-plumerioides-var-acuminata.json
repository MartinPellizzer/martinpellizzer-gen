    "intro": "Euphorbia plumerioides var. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
