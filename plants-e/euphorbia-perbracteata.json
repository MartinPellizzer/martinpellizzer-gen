    "intro": "Euphorbia perbracteata, commonly known as the leafless euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, thick stem and a cluster of modified leaves called phyllodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
