    "intro": "Epidendrum tridactylum var. pallidum, commonly known as the Pale Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and showy, lance-shaped flowers. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
