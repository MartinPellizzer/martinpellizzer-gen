    "intro": "Euphorbia cordellata, commonly known as the Cordell's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic and is often used as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia cordellata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat."
