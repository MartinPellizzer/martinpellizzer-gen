It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Zimbabwe and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
