    "intro": "Erythrocephalum setulosum, commonly known as the hairy everlasting or woolly star, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Erythrocephalum setulosum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
