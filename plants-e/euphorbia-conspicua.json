    "intro": "Euphorbia conspicua, commonly known as the showy spurge, is a striking succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, branching stem covered in soft, greenish-gray leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
