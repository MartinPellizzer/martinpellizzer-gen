    "intro": "Eragrostis marquisensis, commonly known as Marquis grass, is a perennial grass species native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
