    "intro": "Epicampes, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in dry, open habitats. They are characterized by their bright yellow ray flowers and dense, bristly foliage. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the stems are erect and often covered in fine hairs. Epicampes species are often found in disturbed soils and are adapted to arid conditions."
