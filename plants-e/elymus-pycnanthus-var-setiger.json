It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
