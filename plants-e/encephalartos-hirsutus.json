    "intro": "Encephalartos hirsutus, commonly known as the Hairy Cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, hairy structures. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
