    "intro": "Eucalyptus risdonii, commonly known as the Risdons gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The flowers are typically white or cream, clustered in umbels, and are followed by small, woody capsules. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses by Indigenous communities."
