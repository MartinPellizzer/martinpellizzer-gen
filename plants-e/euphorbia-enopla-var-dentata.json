    "intro": "Euphorbia enopla var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in soft, pale greenish-yellow hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
