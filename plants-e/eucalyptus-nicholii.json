    "intro": "Eucalyptus nicholii, commonly known as the black mountain gum, is a tall evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus nicholii is well adapted to dry and nutrient-poor soils, often growing in sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
