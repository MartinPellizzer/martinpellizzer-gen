    "intro": "Encephalosphaera, commonly known as the \"brain sphere,\" is a unique genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, thalloid structure that resembles a brain-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in forest floors. Encephalosphaera species are usually small, with a dense, cushion-like growth form. Botanically, they are distinguished by their complex thallus with specialized structures for water absorption and photosynthesis."
