    "intro": "Eugenia stolzii, commonly known as the Stolzii guava, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pink to red berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface with a slightly serrated edge. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit, which is similar to that of the common guava."
