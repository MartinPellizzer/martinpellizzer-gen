    "intro": "Epidendrum quadrangulatum, commonly known as the four-sided epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with prominent red or orange sepals and petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
