    "intro": "Ehretia inamoena, commonly known as the silverleaf mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape tree."
