    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hikenii, commonly known as the Hiken's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, a feature common in many fern species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Elaphoglossum hikenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
