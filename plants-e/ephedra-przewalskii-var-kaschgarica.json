    "intro": "Ephedra przewalskii var. kaschgarica, commonly known as the Karakoram ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and contains alkaloids, including ephedrine, which have medicinal properties. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in mountainous and desert environments. Due to its ecological significance and potential for overharvesting, it is sometimes protected in its natural habitat."
