    "intro": "Eriosyce villosa, commonly known as the hairy echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or grayish hairs, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a short, thick base and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eriosyce villosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
