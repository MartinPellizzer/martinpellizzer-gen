    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. falciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
