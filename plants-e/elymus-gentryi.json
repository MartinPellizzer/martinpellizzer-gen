    "intro": "Elymus gentryi, commonly known as Gentry's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in arid environments. Elymus gentryi is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in high-elevation regions."
