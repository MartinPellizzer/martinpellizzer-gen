    "intro": "Eriocoma contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf eriocoma, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
