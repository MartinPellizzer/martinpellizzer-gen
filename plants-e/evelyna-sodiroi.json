    "intro": "Evelyna sodiroi, commonly known as the velvet-leaved orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Evelyna sodiroi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
