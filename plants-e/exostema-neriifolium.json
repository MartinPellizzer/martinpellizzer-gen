It is characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
