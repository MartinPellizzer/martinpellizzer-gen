    "intro": "Erigeron arcticus, commonly known as Arctic Fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its foliage is generally hairy, helping to insulate the plant against harsh weather conditions. Erigeron arcticus produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
