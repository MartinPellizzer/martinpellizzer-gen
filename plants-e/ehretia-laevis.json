    "intro": "Ehretia laevis, commonly known as the smooth ehretia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are smooth and glossy on both sides. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Ehretia laevis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
