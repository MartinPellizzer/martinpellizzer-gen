    "intro": "Elaphoglossum zettleri, commonly known as the Zettler's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Elaphoglossum zettleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
