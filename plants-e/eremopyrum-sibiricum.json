    "intro": "Eremopyrum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and rocky soils with limited water availability. Eremopyrum sibiricum plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
