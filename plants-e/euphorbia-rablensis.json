    "intro": "Euphorbia rablensis, commonly known as the Rabl's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
