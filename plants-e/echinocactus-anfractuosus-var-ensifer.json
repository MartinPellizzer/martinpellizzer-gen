    "intro": "Echinocactus anfractuosus var. ensifer, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a spine-tipped cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent ribs and is covered in clusters of sharp, forward-pointing spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the top of the stems. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established. This variety is valued for its distinctive appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
