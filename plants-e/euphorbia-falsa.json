The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with erect, branched stems that are covered in fine, sticky hairs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy texture. The flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia."
