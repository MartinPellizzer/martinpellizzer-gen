It belongs to the genus Epilobium, which includes various species of flowering plants in the evening primrose family, Onagraceae. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. Epilobium \u00d7 simulatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
