    "intro": "Erechtites hieraciifolius var. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hairy ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its allergenic pollen, it is considered a weed in agricultural and urban settings."
