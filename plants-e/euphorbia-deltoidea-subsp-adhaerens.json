    "intro": "Euphorbia deltoidea subsp. adhaerens, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
