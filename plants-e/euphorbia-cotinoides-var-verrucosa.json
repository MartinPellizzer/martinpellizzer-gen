    "intro": "Euphorbia cotinoides var. verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in a thick layer of waxy, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and hardy characteristics."
