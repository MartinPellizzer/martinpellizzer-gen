    "intro": "Euphorbia mamfwensis, commonly known as the Mamfwens Island Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Mamfwen in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or green, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems for survival. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
