    "intro": "Euonymus ceratophorus, commonly known as the horned euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its fruit, which are actually modified calyces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with smooth margins and a glossy texture. Euonymus ceratophorus is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
