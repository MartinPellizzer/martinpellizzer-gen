    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 schmalhausenii nothosubsp. fleischmannii, commonly known as the Schmalhausen hybrid orchid, is a rare, naturally occurring hybrid between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is a perennial herb with a complex morphology that reflects its hybrid origin. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
