    "intro": "Ericameria linearis, commonly known as linear goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its linear, needle-like leaves and bright yellow flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Ericameria linearis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
