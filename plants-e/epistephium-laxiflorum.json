It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
