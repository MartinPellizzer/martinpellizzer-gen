    "intro": "Eleocharis leptos, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond margins, and along streams, preferring saturated or waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Eleocharis leptos plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
