It is a succulent cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina, and is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stem and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-draining soil and full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
