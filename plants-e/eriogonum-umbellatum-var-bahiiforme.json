It is characterized by its clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble popcorn, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
