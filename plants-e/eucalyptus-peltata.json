    "intro": "Eucalyptus peltata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, often in dry, sandy soils. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pink in color. Eucalyptus peltata is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
