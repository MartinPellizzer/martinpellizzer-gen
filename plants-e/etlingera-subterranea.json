    "intro": "Etlingera subterranea, commonly known as the underground torch ginger, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking red and yellow inflorescence, which resembles a torch, and its unique underground growth habit. The plant produces a single, elongated spike that emerges from the soil, bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Etlingera subterranea is considered a conservation concern."
