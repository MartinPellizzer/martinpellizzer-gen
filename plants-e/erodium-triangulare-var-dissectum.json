    "intro": "Erodium triangulare var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and garden beds. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens for its delicate foliage and modest blooms."
