    "intro": "Euphorbia heptagona var. viridis, commonly known as the green-edged euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, greenish-gray, polygonal stems with a waxy texture and sharp, spiny margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
