    "intro": "Eriogonum jamesii subsp. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, globular heads, which give the plant its common name. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
