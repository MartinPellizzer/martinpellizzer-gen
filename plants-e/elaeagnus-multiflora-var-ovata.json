    "intro": "Elaeagnus multiflora var. ovata, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a silvery pubescence, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that turn red in the fall. It is adapted to dry soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
