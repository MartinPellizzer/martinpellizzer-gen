It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a simple reproductive system, relying on spores for propagation rather than seeds. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms. Elatostematoides australis is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
