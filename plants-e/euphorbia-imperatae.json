    "intro": "Euphorbia imperatae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a reddish tint, especially under stress. Euphorbia imperatae is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
