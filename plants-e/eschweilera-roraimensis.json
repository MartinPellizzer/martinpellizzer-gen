    "intro": "Eschweilera roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima starfruit, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed raw or used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in the region."
