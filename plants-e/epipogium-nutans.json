    "intro": "Epipogium nutans, commonly known as the nodding ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive, hood-like structure. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, often in association with specific fungal hosts. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
