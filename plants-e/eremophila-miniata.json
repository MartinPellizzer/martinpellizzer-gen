    "intro": "Eremophila miniata, commonly known as the small-flowered emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, leathery fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Eremophila miniata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
