    "intro": "Epidendrum acrorhodum, commonly known as the red-tipped epidendron, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum acrorhodum thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
