    "intro": "Eucladus, commonly known as the European heath, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. They are often found in acidic, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Eucladus species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, a trait common among members of the Ericaceae family. The flowers are usually pink or white, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
