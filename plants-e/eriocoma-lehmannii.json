    "intro": "Eriocoma lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's ericoid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
