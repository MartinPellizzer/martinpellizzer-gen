    "intro": "Echinella aspasicensis, commonly known as the Aspasio's hedgehog cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Spain. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that resemble a hedgehog, with a thick, fleshy texture adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echinella aspasicensis is considered a vulnerable species."
