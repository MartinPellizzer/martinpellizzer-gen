    "intro": "Elaphoglossum amplissimum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in humid climates."
