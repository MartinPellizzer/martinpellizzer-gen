    "intro": "Euphorbia philippina, commonly known as the Philippine spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces a unique, cyathium-like inflorescence that is often mistaken for a flower. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive dry conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in rocky gardens."
