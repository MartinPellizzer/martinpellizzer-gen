    "intro": "Echinocereus morricalii, commonly known as the Morral's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the United States, primarily found in Texas. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a globular or cylindrical stem that is often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically tubular in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
