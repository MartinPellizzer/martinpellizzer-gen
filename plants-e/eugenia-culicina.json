It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round, purple-black berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
