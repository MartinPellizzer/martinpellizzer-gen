    "intro": "Eria kalabakanensis, commonly known as the Kalabakan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Kalabakan region of Indonesia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within lowland forests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
