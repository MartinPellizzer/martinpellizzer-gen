    "intro": "Echinocarpus arfakensis, commonly known as the African burr or red burr, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that encase the seeds, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small yellow flowers. Echinocarpus arfakensis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
