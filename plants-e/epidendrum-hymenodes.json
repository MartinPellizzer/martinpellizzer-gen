    "intro": "Epidendrum hymenodes, commonly known as the silver-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish bloom of fine pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate to high humidity for optimal growth. Epidendrum hymenodes is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
