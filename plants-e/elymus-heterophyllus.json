    "intro": "Elymus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being narrow and grass-like while others are broader and more herbaceous. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters, and it flowers in the summer months. Elymus heterophyllus is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can thrive in both moist and dry conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
