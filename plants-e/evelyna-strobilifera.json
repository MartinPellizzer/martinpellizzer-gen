    "intro": "Evelyna strobilifera, commonly known as the golden coneflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, yellow-orange flower heads resembling cones, which give it its scientific name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Evelyna strobilifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens due to its low water requirements."
