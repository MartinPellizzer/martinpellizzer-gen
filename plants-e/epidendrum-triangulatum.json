    "intro": "Epidendrum triangulatum, commonly known as the Triangular Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers with three prominent lobes, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum triangulatum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
