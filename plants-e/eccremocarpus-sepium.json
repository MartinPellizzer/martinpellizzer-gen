    "intro": "Eccremocarpus sepium, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed fruits that split open to release its seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in salty, coastal environments. Eccremocarpus sepium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
