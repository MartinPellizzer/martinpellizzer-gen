    "intro": "Euphorbia johannis, commonly known as the Johann's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a whitish, powdery substance called farina. Euphorbia johannis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
