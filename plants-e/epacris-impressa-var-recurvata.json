    "intro": "Epacris impressa var. recurvata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf epacris, is a species of flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathland and open forests, often in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces spikes of tubular, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive recurved tip, giving it its specific epithet. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms."
