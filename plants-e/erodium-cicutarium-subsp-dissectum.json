    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium subsp. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems that are often prostrate or ascending, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are finely dissected, giving the plant a feathery appearance. The flowers are pink to purple, with five petals, and appear in clusters at the leaf axils. It produces small, dry fruits called capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
