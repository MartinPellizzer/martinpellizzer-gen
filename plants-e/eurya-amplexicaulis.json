    "intro": "Eurya amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping evergreen holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that often wrap around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Native to eastern Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with cool, humid climates."
