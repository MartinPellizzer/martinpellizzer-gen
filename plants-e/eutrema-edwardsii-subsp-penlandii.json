    "intro": "Eutrema edwardsii subsp. penlandii, commonly known as the Penland's seaside mustard, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, narrow leaves adapted to salty, windy environments. This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in tidal zones. Its growth is typically low to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize coastal dunes. The plant plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
