    "intro": "Epidendrum pentacarinatum, commonly known as the Purple-Flowered Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in racemes along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum pentacarinatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
