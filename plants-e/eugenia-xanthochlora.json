    "intro": "Eugenia xanthochlora, commonly known as the golden eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color beneath, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
