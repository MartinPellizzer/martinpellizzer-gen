    "intro": "Eriophorum altaicum, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. Its rhizomes form tussocks, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in fragile environments. Eriophorum altaicum plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
