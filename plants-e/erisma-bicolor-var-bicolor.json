    "intro": "Erisma bicolor var. bicolor, commonly known as the white and purple eriska, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white and purple. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
