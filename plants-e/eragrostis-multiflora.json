    "intro": "Eragrostis multiflora, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the fine pubescence on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Eragrostis multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
