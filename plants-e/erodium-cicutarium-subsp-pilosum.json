    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium subsp. pilosum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing annual herb with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
