    "intro": "Ephedra strobilacea, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cones that contain the seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Ephedra strobilacea is a member of the Ephedraceae family, which is closely related to the coniferous gymnosperms. Its morphology reflects adaptations to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
