    "intro": "Euphorbia retrospina, commonly known as the backward spine euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually spine-tipped and may be reduced or absent in mature plants. Euphorbia retrospina is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
