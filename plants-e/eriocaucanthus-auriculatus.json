It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often adorned with waxy, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the warm season.

Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
