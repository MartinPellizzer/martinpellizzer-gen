    "intro": "Eremurus spectabilis var. marginatus, commonly known as the purple grass or the giant spikerush, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces large, showy panicles of pale yellow to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to add vertical interest to gardens."
