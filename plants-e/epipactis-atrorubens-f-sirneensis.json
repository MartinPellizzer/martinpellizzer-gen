    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens f. sirneensis, commonly known as the Sirnean marsh helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions in Europe. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown petals and sepals, with a yellow-green lip that distinguishes it from other members of the genus. This orchid typically grows in wet, shaded habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
