    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic field horsetail, is a variant of the common field horsetail. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. This plant thrives in wet, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in arctic and alpine regions. Its stems are jointed and hollow, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant reproduces through spores, and its unique morphology reflects adaptations to cold and harsh environments."
