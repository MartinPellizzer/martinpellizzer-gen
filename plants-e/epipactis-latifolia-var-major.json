    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and a tall, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces a greenish-yellow or brownish flower with a dark red or purple lip, which attracts specific pollinators. This orchid is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
