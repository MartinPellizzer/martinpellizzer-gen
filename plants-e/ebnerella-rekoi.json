    "intro": "Ebnerella rekoi, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, often branched stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Ebnerella rekoi is adapted to the humid, shaded environments of Madagascar's rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
