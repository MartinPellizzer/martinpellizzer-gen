    "intro": "Epilobium alpinum var. minus, commonly known as the alpine willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes or meadows where conditions are harsh. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are pink to purple in color, blooming in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Epilobium alpinum."
