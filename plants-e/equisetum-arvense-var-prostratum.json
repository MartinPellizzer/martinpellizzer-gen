    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate field horsetail, is a low-growing variant of the horsetail plant. It is characterized by its slender, green stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typical of the Equisetum genus. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. This variety thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks."
