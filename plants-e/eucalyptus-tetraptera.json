    "intro": "Eucalyptus tetraptera, commonly known as the broad-leaved malleeflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers in clusters, typically during the winter months. It is a hardy shrub or small tree that thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands. Eucalyptus tetraptera plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
