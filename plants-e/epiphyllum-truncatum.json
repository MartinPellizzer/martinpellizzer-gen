    "intro": "Epiphyllum truncatum, commonly known as the moon cactus or night bloomer, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is a climbing or trailing cactus with flat, fleshy stems that are often segmented. The plant is native to Mexico and is characterized by its nocturnal flowering habit, producing large, showy flowers that open at night. Its stems are often used as a host for other cacti, such as the Gymnocalycium mihanotis, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
