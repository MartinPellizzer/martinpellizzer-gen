    "intro": "Excoecaria tenax, commonly known as the croton or sea croton, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its striking, colorful, and often variegated foliage, which can range from green to yellow, red, and orange. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
