    "intro": "Eupatorium foliolosum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, with serrated edges and a rough texture, and it produces fluffy, seed-filled capitula that aid in wind pollination. Eupatorium foliolosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
