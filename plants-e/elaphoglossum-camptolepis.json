    "intro": "Elaphoglossum camptolepis, commonly known as the curled frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that often curl at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters known as sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
