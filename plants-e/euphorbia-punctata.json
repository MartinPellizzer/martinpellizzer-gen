    "intro": "Euphorbia punctata, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in small, yellowish dots. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
