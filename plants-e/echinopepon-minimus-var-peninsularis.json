    "intro": "Echinopepon minimus var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Cucurbit, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squash, and gourds, and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are typically green when mature, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
