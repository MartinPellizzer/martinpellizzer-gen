    "intro": "Empetrum atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple willow-owen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, dark purple to red berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Empetrum atropurpureum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its cold climate."
