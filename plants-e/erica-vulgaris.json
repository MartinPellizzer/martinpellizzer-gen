    "intro": "Erica vulgaris, commonly known as heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its leaves are needle-like and gray-green, and it produces small, woody fruits called capsules. Erica vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
