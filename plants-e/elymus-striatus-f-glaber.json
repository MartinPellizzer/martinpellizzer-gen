    "intro": "Elymus striatus f. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous feathergrass, is a variant of the common feathergrass. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless, giving it its \"glaber\" designation. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets arranged in a loose, branching pattern. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
