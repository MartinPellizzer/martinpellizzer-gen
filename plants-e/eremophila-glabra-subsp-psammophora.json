    "intro": "Eremophila glabra subsp. psammophora, commonly known as the sand eremophila, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapting well to drought conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
