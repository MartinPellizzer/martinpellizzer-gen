    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla var. graminifolia, commonly known as the grassleaf spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 (cyathia) that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden environments. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
