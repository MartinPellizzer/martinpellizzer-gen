    "intro": "Erigeron glabratus subsp. candidus, commonly known as the white fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white ray florets and dark brown disk florets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and ecological importance to pollinators."
