    "intro": "Evaiezoa cespitosa, commonly known as the tufted grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tufted at the base. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Evaiezoa cespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
