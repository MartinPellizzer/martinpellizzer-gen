    "intro": "Elymus canadensis var. hirsutus, commonly known as Canadian wild rye, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its common name. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
