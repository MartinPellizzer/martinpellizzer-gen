    "intro": "Euphorbia lignosa, commonly known as the lignous spurge, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia lignosa is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
