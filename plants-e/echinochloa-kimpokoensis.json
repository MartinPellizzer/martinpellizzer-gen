    "intro": "Echinochloa kimpokoensis, commonly known as Kimpoko grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland and marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in moist soils. E. kimpokoensis is also recognized for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
