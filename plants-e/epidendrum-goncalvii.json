    "intro": "Epidendrum goncalvii, commonly known as the Calypso Orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers that are often white or pale blue with a distinctive purple or violet lip. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in its natural habitat. Epidendrum goncalvii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
