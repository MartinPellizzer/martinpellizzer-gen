    "intro": "Eugenia hiemalis var. marginata, commonly known as the Christmasberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, red berries that appear in winter, providing a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves with serrated margins and produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The varietal name 'marginata' refers to the distinctive white or pale margins on its leaves."
