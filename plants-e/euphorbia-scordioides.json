    "intro": "Euphorbia scordioides, commonly known as the garlic euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
