    "intro": "Eragrostis tenuissima, commonly known as slender weeping grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Americas. It features fine, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
