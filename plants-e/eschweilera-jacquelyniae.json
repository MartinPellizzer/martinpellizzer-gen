    "intro": "Eschweilera jacquelyniae, commonly known as the Jacquelyniae wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of the forest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
