    "intro": "Eriogonum coriaceum, commonly known as the toughleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. Eriogonum coriaceum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures."
