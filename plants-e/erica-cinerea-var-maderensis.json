    "intro": "Erica cinerea var. maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and heathlands. Erica cinerea var. maderensis is well adapted to harsh climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
