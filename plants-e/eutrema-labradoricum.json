It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, tolerating saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pink or white, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
