    "intro": "Eclipta procumbens var. patula, commonly known as white echinata, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate growth habit and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
