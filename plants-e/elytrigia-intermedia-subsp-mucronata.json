    "intro": "Elytrigia intermedia subsp. mucronata, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The subspecies is distinguished by its short, sharp apical bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance among other grasses."
