    "intro": "Elaphrium lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly elaphrium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, hairy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
