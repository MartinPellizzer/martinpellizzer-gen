    "intro": "Espeletia discoidea, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo Star,\" is a striking plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in the high-altitude, often frosty environment. Its flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Espeletia discoidea plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
