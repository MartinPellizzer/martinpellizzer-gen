    "intro": "Eria sublobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eria, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with pale yellow to greenish-white petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions."
