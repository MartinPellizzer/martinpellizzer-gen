    "intro": "Echium strictum subsp. gomerae, commonly known as the Gomera thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
