    "intro": "Elaeocarpus thelmae, commonly known as the Telford elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers, followed by round, fleshy fruits that are typically red or purple when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understorey layers of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
