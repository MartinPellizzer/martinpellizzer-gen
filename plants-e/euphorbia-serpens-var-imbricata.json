It features a prostrate growth habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
