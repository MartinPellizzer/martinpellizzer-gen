    "intro": "Epidendrum adnatum, commonly known as the Crimson Lip Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-red flowers with a distinctive, lip-like petal that extends beyond the rest of the bloom. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Epidendrum adnatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
