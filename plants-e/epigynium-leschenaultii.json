It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. The epigynium, a specialized structure, is involved in the reproductive process and is a key feature in the identification of this species."
