    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil."
