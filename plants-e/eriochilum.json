    "intro": "Eriochilum, commonly known as the pinkroot or mountain pink, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to North America, particularly found in the western United States and parts of Mexico. The plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in alpine or arid environments. They have showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and their roots are often tuberous, which is why they are called pinkroot. Eriochilum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant flowers."
