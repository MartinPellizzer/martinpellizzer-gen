    "intro": "Ebermaiera zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, oily wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and a strong, spicy scent. It produces small, white flowers followed by dark, round berries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as an endangered species."
