    "intro": "Eriogonum tumulosum, commonly known as the tumulus globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mounded growth habit and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Eriogonum tumulosum is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in disturbed soils or along trails."
