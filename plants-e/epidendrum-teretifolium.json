    "intro": "Epidendrum teretifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum teretifolium is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
