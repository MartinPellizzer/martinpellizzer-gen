    "intro": "Echinocereus fitchii subsp. bergmannii, commonly known as the Bergmann's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and areoles, which are specialized structures for producing spines, flowers, and branches. The plant produces clusters of yellow or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
