    "intro": "Eulophia bangweolensis, commonly known as the Bangweol orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, with long, narrow leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are often pink or purple, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
