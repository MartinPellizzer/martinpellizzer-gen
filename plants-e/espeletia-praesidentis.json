    "intro": "Espeletia praesidentis, commonly known as the President's heather, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a perennial plant characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to alpine and paramo ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often studied for its role in high-altitude biodiversity."
