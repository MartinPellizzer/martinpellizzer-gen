    "intro": "Elaphoglossum madidiense, commonly known as the Madidi holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Amazon basin. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests at low to moderate elevations. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern typical of the genus."
