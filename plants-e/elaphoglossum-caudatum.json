    "intro": "Elaphoglossum caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a trailing or creeping growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are often covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum caudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
