    "intro": "Eupatorium sonorae, commonly known as Sonoran blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along washes. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing some drought tolerance. Eupatorium sonorae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
