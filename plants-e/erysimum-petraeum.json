    "intro": "Erysimum petraeum, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Erysimum petraeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
