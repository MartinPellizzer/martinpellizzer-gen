    "intro": "Encephalosphaera vitellina, commonly known as the yellow cup lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-brown thallus, which is typically flattened and leaf-like in appearance. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the genus Ascomycota. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on tree bark or rocks. Encephalosphaera vitellina is widely distributed across temperate regions and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
