    "intro": "Enneapogon caerulescens, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which makes it visually distinctive. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Blue grama is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological value."
