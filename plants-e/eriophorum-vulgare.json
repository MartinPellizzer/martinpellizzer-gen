    "intro": "Eriophorum vulgare, commonly known as cotton grass, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually dark green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Eriophorum vulgare plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
