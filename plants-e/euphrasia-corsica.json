    "intro": "Euphrasia corsica, commonly known as the Corsican eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Euphrasia corsica is often found in mountainous areas and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its name derives from the Greek \"euphrasis,\" meaning joy or pleasure, possibly due to its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
