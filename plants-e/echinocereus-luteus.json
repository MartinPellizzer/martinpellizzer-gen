    "intro": "Echinocereus luteus, commonly known as the yellow hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with yellow or green hues. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Echinocereus luteus is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
