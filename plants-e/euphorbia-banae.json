    "intro": "Euphorbia banae, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its sap contains latex, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Euphorbia banae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
