    "intro": "Erica canthariformis, commonly known as the Cape rose, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the heath family, Ericaceae, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Erica canthariformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy environments."
