    "intro": "Euryops caespitosus, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellow dandelion-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy white seeds. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Euryops caespitosus is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
