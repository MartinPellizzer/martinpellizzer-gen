    "intro": "Euphorbia exclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and compact growth habit."
