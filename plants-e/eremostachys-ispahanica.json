    "intro": "Eremostachys ispahanica, commonly known as the Persian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Iran. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green foliage adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in Mediterranean and semi-arid climates."
