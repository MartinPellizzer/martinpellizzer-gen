    "intro": "Euonymus saxicola, commonly known as the rock euonymus, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces distinctive red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or forested habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
