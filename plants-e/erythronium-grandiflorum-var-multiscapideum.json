    "intro": "Erythronium grandiflorum var. multiscapideum, commonly known as the clustered yellow trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces multiple stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers with three petals, usually in shades of yellow or white. These flowers bloom in early spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
