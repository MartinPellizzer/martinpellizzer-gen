    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides var. major, commonly known as the desert croton, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
