It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and streambanks. The plant has slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to purple flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open to release the seeds."
