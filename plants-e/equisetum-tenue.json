    "intro": "Equisetum tenue, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. Equisetum tenue thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
