    "intro": "Eleiotis monophylla var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded eleiotis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a single, broad, and lance-shaped leaf that is often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, smooth-seeded fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
