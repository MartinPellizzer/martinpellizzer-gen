    "intro": "Eschweilera awaensis, commonly known as the Awa rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Eschweilera awaensis is considered endangered."
