It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eragrostis anacrantha is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in various ecological settings."
