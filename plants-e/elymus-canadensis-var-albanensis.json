    "intro": "Elymus canadensis var. albanensis, commonly known as the Albanian Canada wildrye, is a grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
