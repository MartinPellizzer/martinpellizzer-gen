    "intro": "Eucalyptus langii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringy gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, stringy branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often coated with a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin strips, revealing a mottled pattern of grey and green. Eucalyptus langii is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions and open woodlands."
