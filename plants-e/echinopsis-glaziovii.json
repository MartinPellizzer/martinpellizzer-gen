    "intro": "Echinopsis glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in the evening. It is a succulent, storing water in its thick stem to survive in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
