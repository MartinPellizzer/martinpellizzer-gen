    "intro": "Eucalyptus rowleyi, commonly known as the Rowley's malleeforest gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands and heathlands. The tree has smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus rowleyi is known for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
