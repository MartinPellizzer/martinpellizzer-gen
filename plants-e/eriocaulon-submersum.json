    "intro": "Eriocaulon submersum, commonly known as the submerged spike-rush, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often submerged, with small, spike-like inflorescences at the tips. Its leaves are narrow and may be partially submerged or floating, depending on water conditions. Eriocaulon submersum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
