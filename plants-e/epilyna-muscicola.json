    "intro": "Epilyna muscicola, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, moss-like coating, which helps retain moisture. It is often found in forest understories and along rocky outcrops in temperate regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a valuable indicator species for assessing ecosystem health."
