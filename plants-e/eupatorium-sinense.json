It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. It is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens."
