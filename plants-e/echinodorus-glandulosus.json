    "intro": "Echinodorus glandulosus, commonly known as the woolly swordplant, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the water surface. Echinodorus glandulosus is popular in aquariums due to its hardy nature and ability to provide oxygen and shelter for aquatic life."
