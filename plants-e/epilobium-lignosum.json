    "intro": "Epilobium lignosum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its woody stems provide structural support, and it often grows in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Epilobium lignosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
