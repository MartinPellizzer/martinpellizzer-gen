    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lalitae, commonly known as the Lalita holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum lalitae is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
