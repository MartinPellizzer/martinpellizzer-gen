    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale, commonly known as the scottish horsehair fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the genus Equisetum. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a distinct, hollow stem that remains green throughout the year. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fossil record dates back to the Carboniferous period. Equisetum hyemale is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of materials for basket weaving."
