    "intro": "Eupatorium saltivarii, commonly known as the bouncing eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its common name reflects the way its stems appear to \"bounce\" or sway in the wind. Eupatorium saltivarii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
