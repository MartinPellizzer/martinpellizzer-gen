It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive ear-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet flowers. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
