It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a showy, greenish-yellow flower spike that bears numerous small, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces a single, erect stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height.
