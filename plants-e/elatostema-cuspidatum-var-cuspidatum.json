    "intro": "Elatostema cuspidatum var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elatostema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny white or pale green flowers arranged in dense clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
