    "intro": "Euonymus europaeus var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf European spindle tree, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ccelanthaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, inflated fruits that split open to reveal seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is generally hardy and adaptable, making it suitable for both garden and landscape settings."
