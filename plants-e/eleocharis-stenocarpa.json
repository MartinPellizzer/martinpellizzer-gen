    "intro": "Eleocharis stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that disperse via water or wind. Eleocharis stenocarpa is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
