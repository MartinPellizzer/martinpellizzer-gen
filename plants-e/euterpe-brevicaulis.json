    "intro": "Euterpe brevicaulis, commonly known as the dwarf palm or small-breasted palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its short trunk and pinnate leaves, which are typically green and leathery in texture. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellow flowers, followed by edible fruits that are consumed by both wildlife and humans. Due to habitat loss, Euterpe brevicaulis is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving biodiversity."
