    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. atrorubens, commonly known as the red-veined helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves with prominent reddish veins, and its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often forming dense colonies. It produces a single, erect spike of flowers, each with a distinctive, forward-curving lip. This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and moths."
