    "intro": "Epidendrum jajense, commonly known as the Jaj\u00e9 Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its erect, pseudobulbous growth habit and produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in yellow or orange hues, with petals that are often marked with red or purple streaks. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum jajense is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
