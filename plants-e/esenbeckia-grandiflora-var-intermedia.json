    "intro": "Esenbeckia grandiflora var. intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or false starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow-orange berries that resemble starfruits in appearance. These berries are edible and have a mildly sweet, tangy flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
