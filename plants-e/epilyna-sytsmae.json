    "intro": "Epilyna sytsmae, commonly known as the Sytsma's epilyna, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its small, clustered inflorescences attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Epilyna sytsmae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
