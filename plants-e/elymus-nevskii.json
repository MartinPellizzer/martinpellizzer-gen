    "intro": "Elymus nevskii, commonly known as the Nevsky's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. Elymus nevskii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
