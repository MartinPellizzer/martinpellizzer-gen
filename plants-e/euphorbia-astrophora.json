    "intro": "Euphorbia astrophora, commonly known as the star-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped bracts that give it its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia astrophora is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appeal."
