    "intro": "Euphorbia heraldiana, commonly known as the Herald's spurge, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or red-tinged. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which give it a dramatic appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Euphorbia heraldiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
