    "intro": "Euphorbia radfanensis, commonly known as Radfan\u2019s spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
