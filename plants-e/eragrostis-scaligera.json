    "intro": "Eragrostis scaligera, commonly known as the hairy lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Eragrostis scaligera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
