    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus var. brevisetus, commonly known as the short-haired wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
