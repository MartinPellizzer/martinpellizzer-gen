    "intro": "Embothrium sericeum var. minor, commonly known as the silverleaf embothrium, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is largely due to its unique foliage and seasonal flowering. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
