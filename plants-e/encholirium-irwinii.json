    "intro": "Encholirium irwinii, commonly known as the Mexican firecracker, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that resemble firecrackers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, helping to retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is often cultivated by succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts."
