    "intro": "Echinops lanuginosus, commonly known as the hairy thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads. The plant features silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its showy, yellow flower heads bloom in the spring, followed by the distinctive, spiky fruits that give it its common name. Echinops lanuginosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
