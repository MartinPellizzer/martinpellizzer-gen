    "intro": "Euphorbia capillaris, commonly known as the curly cupplant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, hair-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure, which is a common feature among euphorbias. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
