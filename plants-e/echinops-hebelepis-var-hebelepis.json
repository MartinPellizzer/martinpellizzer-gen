    "intro": "Echinops hebelepis var. hebelepis, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, globe-shaped stem with soft, fuzzy gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
