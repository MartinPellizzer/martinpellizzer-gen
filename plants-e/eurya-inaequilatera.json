    "intro": "Eurya inaequilatera, commonly known as the unequal-leaved eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with the upper surface being darker and glossier than the lower surface, giving it the \"unequal-leaved\" description. It produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by berries that are initially green and turn red as they mature. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
