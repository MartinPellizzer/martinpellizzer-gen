    "intro": "Eleocharis acicularis var. longiseta, commonly known as the long-bearded spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, three-angled berries. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is adapted to moist or submerged environments, making it an important component of aquatic and marsh ecosystems."
