    "intro": "Epidendrum inhibitiosum, commonly known as the Inhibited Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
