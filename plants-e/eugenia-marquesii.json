    "intro": "Eugenia marquesii, commonly known as the Marquesan guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Marquesas in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or purple when mature. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
