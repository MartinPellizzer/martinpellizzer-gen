    "intro": "Echinocitrus, commonly known as the spiny citrus, is a member of the Rutaceae family, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that transition into oval, green fruits with a thick, leathery rind. The fruit contains a single large seed and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, Echinocitrus plays a significant role in its native ecosystems."
