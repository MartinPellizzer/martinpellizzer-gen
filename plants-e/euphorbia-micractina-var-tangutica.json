    "intro": "Euphorbia micractina var. tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It features a compact, low-growing structure with fleshy, ribbed stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its thick stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
