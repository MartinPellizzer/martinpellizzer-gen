    "intro": "Eriophorum pubescens, commonly known as the tufted cottongrass, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Eriophorum pubescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing peat soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
