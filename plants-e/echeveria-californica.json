    "intro": "Echeveria californica, commonly known as the Coast Gold or California Evening Primrose, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of California. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal care."
