    "intro": "Eragrostis psammodes var. microstachya, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton, and it thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps that provide erosion control and habitat for small wildlife."
