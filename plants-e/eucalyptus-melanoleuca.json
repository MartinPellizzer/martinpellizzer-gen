    "intro": "Eucalyptus melanoleuca, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This tree is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
