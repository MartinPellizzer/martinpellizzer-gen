    "intro": "Eugenia quadriflora, commonly known as the \"four-flowered eugenia,\" is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. These flowers give way to edible, dark purple berries that are often used in local cuisines. Eugenia quadriflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
