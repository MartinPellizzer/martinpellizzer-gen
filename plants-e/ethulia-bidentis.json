    "intro": "Ethulia bidentis, commonly known as the two-toothed plant, is a herbaceous species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves with two distinct teeth at the margins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its unique leaf morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
