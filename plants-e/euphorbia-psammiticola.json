    "intro": "Euphorbia psammiticola, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
