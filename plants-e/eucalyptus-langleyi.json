    "intro": "Eucalyptus langleyi, commonly known as the Langley's malleable, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Eucalyptus langleyi is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional and modern applications."
