    "intro": "Evolvulus diosmoides, commonly known as the blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems and small, five-petaled blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and a weed in agricultural settings."
