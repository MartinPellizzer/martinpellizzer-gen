    "intro": "Euphorbia carinata, commonly known as the ridge spine or African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss. Euphorbia carinata is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
