    "intro": "Erucastrum nasturtiifolium var. subbipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves. It thrives in moist, aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found along the edges of streams and ponds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of watercress. This variety is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology, which sets it apart from other members of the Brassicaceae family."
