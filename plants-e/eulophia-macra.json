    "intro": "Eulophia macra, commonly known as the large-leafed eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with numerous fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and shrublands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in soil, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. Eulophia macra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
