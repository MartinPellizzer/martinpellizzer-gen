    "intro": "Euphorbia angulata, commonly known as the angular spurge, is a succulent plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and can be either simple or lobed, depending on the variety. Euphorbia angulata is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
