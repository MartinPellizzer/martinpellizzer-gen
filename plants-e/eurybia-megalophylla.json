It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with hairy surfaces. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Eurybia megalophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
