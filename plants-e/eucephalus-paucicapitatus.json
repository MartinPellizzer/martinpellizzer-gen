    "intro": "Eucephalus paucicapitatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a rough texture, and its flowers are small, purple to pinkish in color, appearing in late summer to early fall. Eucephalus paucicapitatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
