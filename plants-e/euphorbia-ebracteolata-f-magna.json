    "intro": "Euphorbia ebracteolata f. magna, commonly known as the giant euphorbia, is a variant of the Euphorbia ebracteolata species, characterized by its significantly larger size compared to the typical form. It is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. The plant features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces unique cyathia, which are cup-like structures containing the reproductive parts. This plant is adapted to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient addition to xerophytic gardens."
