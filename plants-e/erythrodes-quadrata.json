    "intro": "Erythrodes quadrata, commonly known as the four-angled erythrodes, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
