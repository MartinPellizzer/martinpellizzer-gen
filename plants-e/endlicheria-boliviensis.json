It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species like willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its star-shaped flowers, typically pink or white, and its preference for high-altitude, temperate climates.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
