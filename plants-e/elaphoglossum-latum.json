    "intro": "Elaphoglossum latum, commonly known as the broad-leafed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. Elaphoglossum latum is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
