    "intro": "Echinopsis gibbosa, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis gibbosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
