    "intro": "Eriogonum helianthemifolium, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and showy, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, woody stems and leathery leaves help it conserve water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
