    "intro": "Elymus sibinicus, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Elymus sibinicus is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
