    "intro": "Erica schlechteri, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in winter, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. Erica schlechteri is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
