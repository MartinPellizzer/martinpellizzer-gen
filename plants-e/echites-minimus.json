    "intro": "Echites minimus, commonly known as the small echites or dwarf echites, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family, which includes plants like philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with clusters of small, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. Its flowers are borne in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is usually white or pale green. Echites minimus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in humid, shady environments."
