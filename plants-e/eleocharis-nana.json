    "intro": "Eleocharis nana, commonly known as dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Eleocharis nana is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Its simple morphology and ecological preferences make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
