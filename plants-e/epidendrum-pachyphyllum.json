    "intro": "Epidendrum pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
