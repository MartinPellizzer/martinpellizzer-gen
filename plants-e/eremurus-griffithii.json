    "intro": "Eremurus griffithii, commonly known as the desert candle, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like flower stalks that emerge from a basal rosette of gray-green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces large, showy yellow or orange flower heads that bloom in late spring or early summer. Eremurus griffithii is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
