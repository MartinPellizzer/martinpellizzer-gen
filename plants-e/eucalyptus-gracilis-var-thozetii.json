    "intro": "Eucalyptus gracilis var. thozetii, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lanceolate, grey-green leaves that are typically glandular-dotted. The flowers are small, white or pale blue, and clustered in umbels, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The bark is smooth and peels in strips, often revealing a mottled or flaky appearance. This variant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a slow growth rate."
