    "intro": "Euphorbia venenata, commonly known as the milkweed euphorbia, is a striking succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia venenata is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
