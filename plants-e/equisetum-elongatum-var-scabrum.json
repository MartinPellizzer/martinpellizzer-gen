    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. scabrum, commonly known as the scabrous horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in rough, scabrous nodes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, typical of its primitive vascular structure. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest surviving plant groups."
