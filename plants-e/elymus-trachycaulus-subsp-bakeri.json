    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically gray-green in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture, which is a defining feature of the Elymus genus. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often forming part of native plant communities. Its botanical structure supports its role as a forage plant for wildlife and livestock in arid environments."
