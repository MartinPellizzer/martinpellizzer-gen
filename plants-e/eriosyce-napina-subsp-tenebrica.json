It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its flowers are usually pale or dark in color, often appearing in the evening. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
