    "intro": "Euphorbia dentata f. cuphosperma, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, upright stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in xerophytic gardens."
