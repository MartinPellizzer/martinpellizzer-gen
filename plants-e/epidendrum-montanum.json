    "intro": "Epidendrum montanum, commonly known as the mountain epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and can produce multiple stems with clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum montanum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
