It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and usually have a slight bluish or grayish tint. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance."
