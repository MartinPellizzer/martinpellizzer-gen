    "intro": "Elymus striatus, commonly known as the stripe grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct stripe pattern along the midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus striatus is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
