    "intro": "Euphorbia versicolores, commonly known as the Variegated Spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features striking, variegated leaves with a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
