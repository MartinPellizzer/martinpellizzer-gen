    "intro": "Euphorbia gayi var. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
