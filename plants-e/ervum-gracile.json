    "intro": "Ervum gracile, commonly known as slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and pods that contain small, elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
