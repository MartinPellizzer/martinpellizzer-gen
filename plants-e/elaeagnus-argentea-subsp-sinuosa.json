    "intro": "Elaeagnus argentea subsp. sinuosa, commonly known as silverthorn or silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white, glandular-pubescent leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation."
