    "intro": "Elymus semicostatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, wind-dispersed seeds. Elymus semicostatus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
