It features dense, evergreen foliage with a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries. It is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping."
