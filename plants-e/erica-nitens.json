    "intro": "Erica nitens, commonly known as the silver heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage of silvery-white to gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica nitens thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
