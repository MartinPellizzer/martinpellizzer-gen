    "intro": "Echinopsis oxygona f. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined moon cactus, is a compact cactus species native to South America. It features a swollen, ribbed stem that stores water, typical of succulent plants. The plant produces small, white flowers during the night, which is a characteristic of many nocturnal blooming cacti. Its short, spiny areoles are a distinguishing feature of this particular form. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive, making it suitable for arid environments."
