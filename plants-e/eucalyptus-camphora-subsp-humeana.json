    "intro": "Eucalyptus camphora subsp. humeana, commonly known as the Hume's narrow-leaf eucalypt, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often coated with a white, powdery bloom. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled pattern beneath. This subspecies is valued for its aromatic oils and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
