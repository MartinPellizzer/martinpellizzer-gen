    "intro": "Ephedra antisiphylitica, commonly known as the Siberian ephedra, is a member of the Ephedraceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a small, branched shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. Its stems are woody and have a distinctive, hollow structure, which helps it conserve water in its native habitat. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been the subject of both scientific research and conservation efforts."
