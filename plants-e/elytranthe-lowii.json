    "intro": "Elytranthe lowii, commonly known as the slender rock-fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has narrow, elongated fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds. Elytranthe lowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
