    "intro": "Eriogonum capillare, commonly known as the slender buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum capillare plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
