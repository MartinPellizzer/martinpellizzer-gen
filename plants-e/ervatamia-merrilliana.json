    "intro": "Ervatamia merrilliana, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, red fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
