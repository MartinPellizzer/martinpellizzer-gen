    "intro": "Encelia canescens var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, curling inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The varietal form tomentosa is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
