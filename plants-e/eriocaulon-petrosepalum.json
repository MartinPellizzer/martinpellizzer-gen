It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in wet or moist environments. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of tiny white or pale green flowers, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs.
