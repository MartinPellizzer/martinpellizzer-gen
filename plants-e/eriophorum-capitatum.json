    "intro": "Eriophorum capitatum, commonly known as cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the tips of its slender, leaf-like stems. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, marshes, and heathlands. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in tight whorls around the stem. The flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and the plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils."
