    "intro": "Exallage ulmifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elm, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitats."
