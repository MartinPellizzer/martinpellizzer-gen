It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
