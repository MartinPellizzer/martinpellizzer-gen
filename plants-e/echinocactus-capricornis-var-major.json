    "intro": "Echinocactus capricornis var. major, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at the top of the stem during the summer months. Its spiny, ribbed structure helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
