    "intro": "Eucalyptus aspera, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels away in long strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a rough texture. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and tableland regions."
