    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 commutatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a hybrid plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Epilobium \u00d7 commutatum is an important plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
