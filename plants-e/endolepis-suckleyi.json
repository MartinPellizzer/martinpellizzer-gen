    "intro": "Endolepis suckleyi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, blooming in the spring and early summer. Endolepis suckleyi is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
