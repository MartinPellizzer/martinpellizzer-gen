    "intro": "Epidendrum brachystachyon, commonly known as the short-stalked epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Epidendrum brachystachyon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
