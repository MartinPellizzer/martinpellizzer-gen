    "intro": "Echeveria ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
