    "intro": "Ephedra alata subsp. alata, commonly known as the desert tea or jointed clubmoss, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and red, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
