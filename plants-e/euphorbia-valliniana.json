    "intro": "Euphorbia valliniana, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branching stem system with spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic. Euphorbia valliniana is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
