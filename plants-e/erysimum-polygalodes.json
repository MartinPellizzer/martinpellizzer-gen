    "intro": "Erysimum polygalodes, commonly known as the yellow wallflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in small, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to species in the genus Polygala, though it is more closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family."
