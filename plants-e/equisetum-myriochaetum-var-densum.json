    "intro": "Equisetum myriochaetum var. densum, commonly known as the dense horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and the presence of jointed, hollow stems. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are located at the tips of the stems. This variety is notable for its dense growth habit and its historical use in traditional medicine."
