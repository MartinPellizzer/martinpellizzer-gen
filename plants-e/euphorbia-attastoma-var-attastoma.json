    "intro": "Euphorbia attastoma var. attastoma, commonly known as the red-veined euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful foliage with prominent veins, which can range from green to red or purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
