    "intro": "Eucalyptus ficifolia var. alba, commonly known as the white-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are borne in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal or sandy soils."
