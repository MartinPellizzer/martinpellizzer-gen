    "intro": "Eupatorium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boneset, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowering period attracts various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Eupatorium pinnatifidum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
