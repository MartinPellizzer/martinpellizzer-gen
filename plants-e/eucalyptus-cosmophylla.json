The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery strips, and it is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands. The species is known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
