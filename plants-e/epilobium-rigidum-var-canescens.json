It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features erect, often glandular-stipitate stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface and a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered flowers with pink to reddish petals. The species is known for its ecological value, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivorous insects."
