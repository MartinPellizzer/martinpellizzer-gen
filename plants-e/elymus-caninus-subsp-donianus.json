    "intro": "Elymus caninus subsp. donianus, commonly known as the Donian false wheat, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous spikelets, which contain the flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting diverse insect and bird life."
