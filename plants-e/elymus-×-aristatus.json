    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 aristatus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits a combination of characteristics from its parent species, Elymus elongatus and Elymus trachycoleus. It is a perennial plant with tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a prominent feature in grassland ecosystems. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are arranged in a loose, open structure. This plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control."
