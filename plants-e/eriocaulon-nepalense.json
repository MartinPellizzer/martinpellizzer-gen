    "intro": "Eriocaulon nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine, hairy layer that aids in water retention. Eriocaulon nepalense is native to the Himalayan regions and is often found in montane habitats across Nepal and adjacent areas."
