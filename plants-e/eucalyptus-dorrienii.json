    "intro": "Eucalyptus dorrienii, commonly known as the Dorrien's mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves, which are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. Eucalyptus dorrienii is often used in revegetation projects due to its ecological importance and hardy nature."
