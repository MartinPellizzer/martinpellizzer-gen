    "intro": "Euphorbia obesa subsp. obesa, commonly known as the football cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, globe-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
