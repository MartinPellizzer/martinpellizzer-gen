    "intro": "Elaeophorbia neriifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a natural defense mechanism. Elaeophorbia neriifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is popular as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
