    "intro": "Eucalyptus doratoxylon, commonly known as the red box, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The tree is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves are usually grey-green in color. It produces small, spherical flower buds that range in color from white to pink, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its timber, which is durable and resistant to decay."
