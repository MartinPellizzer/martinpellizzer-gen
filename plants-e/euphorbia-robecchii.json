    "intro": "Euphorbia robecchii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a distinctive branching structure with spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Euphorbia robecchii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
