    "intro": "Eriogonum geniculatum, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as hillsides and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture. Eriogonum geniculatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native environment."
