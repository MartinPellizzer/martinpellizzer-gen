    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus subsp. villosulus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the dense pubescence on its leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with lemmas that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Its robust root system makes it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and ecological restoration projects."
