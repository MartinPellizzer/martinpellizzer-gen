    "intro": "Eruca muralis, commonly known as wall rocket, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has pinnately divided leaves that are often used in salads. It thrives in rocky or urban environments, making it a common sight on walls and in cracks in pavement. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a weed and a valuable early successional plant."
