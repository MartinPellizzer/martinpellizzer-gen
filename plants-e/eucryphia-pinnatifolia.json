    "intro": "Eucryphia pinnatifolia, commonly known as the coastal pohutukawa, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are pinnately arranged and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. These flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. Eucryphia pinnatifolia thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
