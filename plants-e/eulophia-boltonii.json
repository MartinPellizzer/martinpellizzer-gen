    "intro": "Eulophia boltonii, commonly known as the Bolton's eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces a single, erect inflorescence bearing several showy, orchid-like flowers with a distinctive coloration. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette around the pseudobulb. Eulophia boltonii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
