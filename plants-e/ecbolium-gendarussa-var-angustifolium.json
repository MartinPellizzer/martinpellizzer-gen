    "intro": "Ecbolium gendarussa var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in width. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often with a pale yellow or white hue. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
