    "intro": "Eupatorium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
