    "intro": "Euphorbia furcillata, commonly known as the branched spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
