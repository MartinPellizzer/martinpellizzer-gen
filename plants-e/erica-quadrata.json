    "intro": "Erica quadrata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. Erica quadrata is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
