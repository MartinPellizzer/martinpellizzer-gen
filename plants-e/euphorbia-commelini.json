    "intro": "Euphorbia commelini, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading stem that often forms dense mats, with small, simple leaves that are usually alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions. Euphorbia commelini is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
