    "intro": "Echites catesbaei, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Echites catesbaei plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
