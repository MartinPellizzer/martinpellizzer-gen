    "intro": "Eurya glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky alder or glandular eurya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in glandular dots, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, dark seeds. Eurya glandulosa is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
