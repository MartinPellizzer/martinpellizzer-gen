It is characterized by its aromatic leaves that emit a strong lemon scent due to high concentrations of citral. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The flowers are usually small, white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters, attracting various pollinators."
