    "intro": "Erica bergiana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape region of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, glossy green leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This species is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
