It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and red. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. The flowers are highly fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
