    "intro": "Echinocereus fendleri var. robustus, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features cylindrical stems that are densely covered with sharp, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, typically at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
