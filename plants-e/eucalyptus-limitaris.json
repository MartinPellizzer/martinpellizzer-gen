    "intro": "Eucalyptus limitaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Eucalyptus limitaris plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
