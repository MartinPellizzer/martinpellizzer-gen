    "intro": "Elaphoglossum micropus, commonly known as the small-leaf holly fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, characteristic of the Dryopteridaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its compact size and intricate foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
