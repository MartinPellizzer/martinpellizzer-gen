    "intro": "Echinopsis arebaloi, commonly known as the Arebaloi cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and spiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Echinopsis arebaloi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal flowering habit."
