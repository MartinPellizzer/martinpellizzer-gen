    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. coloratum, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a variant of the narrow-leaved tussock grass. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that form dense tussocks, often growing in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink or purple in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
