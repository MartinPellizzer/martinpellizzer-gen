    "intro": "Eplidium humifusum, commonly known as the groundsel or yellow weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features a prostrate or ascending stem covered with soft, hairy leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense heads, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its flowering structure is similar to that of other members of the Asteraceae family, with ray and disk florets. Eplidium humifusum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
