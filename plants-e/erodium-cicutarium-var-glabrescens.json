    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. glabrescens, commonly known as sticky weed or small erodium, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring small, lance-shaped leaves with a glandular surface that produces a sticky substance. The plant produces pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in non-native regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and agricultural fields."
