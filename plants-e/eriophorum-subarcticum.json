    "intro": "Eriophorum subarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its flowering stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Eriophorum subarcticum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
