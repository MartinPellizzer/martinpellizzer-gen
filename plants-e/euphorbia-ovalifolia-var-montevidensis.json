    "intro": "Euphorbia ovalifolia var. montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense Spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and southern Brazil. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are oval-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in yellow-green clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems for survival. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
