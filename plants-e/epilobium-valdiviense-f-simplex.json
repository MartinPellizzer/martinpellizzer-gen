It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the temperate regions of South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
