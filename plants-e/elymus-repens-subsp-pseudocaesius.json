    "intro": "Elymus repens subsp. pseudocaesius, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle, bearing spikelets that are often hairy. This subspecies is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
