    "intro": "Euphorbia parifolia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, paired leaves that are often fleshy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle the plant with care. Euphorbia parifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience to drought."
