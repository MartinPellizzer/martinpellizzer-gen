    "intro": "Euodia obtusifolia var. arborea, commonly known as the broad-leaved Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to southern China. It features simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by orange to red drupes that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
