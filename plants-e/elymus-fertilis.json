    "intro": "Elymus fertilis, commonly known as the fertile grass or field grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Elymus fertilis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun. Its adaptability makes it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
