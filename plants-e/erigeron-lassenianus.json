    "intro": "Erigeron lassenianus, commonly known as the Lassen's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellow-centered flowers with white ray florets. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Erigeron lassenianus is often found in meadows and open woodlands at high elevations."
