    "intro": "Eriocaulon batholithicola, commonly known as the batholith eriocaulon, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, which includes many small, grass-like plants often found in wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and tiny, scale-like leaves that help it conserve water. It typically thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate species that is sensitive to environmental changes."
