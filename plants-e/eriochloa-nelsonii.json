It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Eriochloa nelsonii is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
