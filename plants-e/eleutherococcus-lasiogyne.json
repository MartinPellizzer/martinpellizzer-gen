    "intro": "Eleutherococcus lasiogyne, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, and its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine. Botanically, it belongs to the family Ericaceae and is valued for its adaptogenic properties due to the presence of compounds like eleutherosides."
