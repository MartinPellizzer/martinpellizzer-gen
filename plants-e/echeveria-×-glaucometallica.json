It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its compact size and striking foliage make it a favored ornamental plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
