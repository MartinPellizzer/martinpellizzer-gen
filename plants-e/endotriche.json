    "intro": "Endotriche, commonly known as the \"sheath moss,\" is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex thallus structure with a central axis and lateral branches, and its leaves are usually small and scale-like. Endotriche species often form symbiotic relationships with fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on specialized shoots and release spores for dispersal."
