    "intro": "Elymus virginicus var. glaucus, commonly known as the bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the primary flowering structures. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and make it a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
