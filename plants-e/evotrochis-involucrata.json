    "intro": "Evotrochis involucrata, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a hairy surface and a slightly serrated edge. Evotrochis involucrata is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
