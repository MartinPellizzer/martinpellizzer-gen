    "intro": "Eucalyptus steedmanii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub form and small, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus steedmanii is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
