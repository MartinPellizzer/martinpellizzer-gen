    "intro": "Epipactis pendula, commonly known as the hanging helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, greenish-yellow flowers that hang from the stems, often in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Epipactis pendula is known for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions, making it a common sight in forest understories."
