    "intro": "Escallonia farinacea, commonly known as the common escallonia, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Escallonia farinacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
