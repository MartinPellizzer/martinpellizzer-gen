    "intro": "Eleutherococcus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny eleutherococcus, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
