    "intro": "Echinocactus brevimammus, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom from the areoles. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
