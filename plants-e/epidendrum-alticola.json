It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its habitat typically includes humid, shaded environments at higher elevations. Epidendrum alticola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
