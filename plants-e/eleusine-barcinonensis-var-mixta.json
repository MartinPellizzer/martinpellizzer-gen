It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
