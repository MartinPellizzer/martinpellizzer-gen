    "intro": "Euphorbia sabulicola, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
