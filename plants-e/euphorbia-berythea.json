    "intro": "Euphorbia berythea, commonly known as the Berythea spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a characteristic structure of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may bear small spines, contributing to its defensive adaptations. Euphorbia berythea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
