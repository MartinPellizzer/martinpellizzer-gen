    "intro": "Erythroxylum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is known for its alkaloid content, particularly cocaine, though it is less commercially significant than Erythroxylum coca. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes."
