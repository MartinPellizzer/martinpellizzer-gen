    "intro": "Eupatoriastrum opadoclinium, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Eupatoriastrum opadoclinium plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
