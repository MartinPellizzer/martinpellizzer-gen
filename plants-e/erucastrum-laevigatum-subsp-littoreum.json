    "intro": "Erucastrum laevigatum subsp. littoreum, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in salt marshes and dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, slender pods containing seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
