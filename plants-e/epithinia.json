    "intro": "Epithinia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble ghostly faces or figures, hence its common name. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produce small, tubular flowers in clusters. Epithinia species are native to tropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded habitats. They are valued in horticulture for their unique and dramatic floral displays."
