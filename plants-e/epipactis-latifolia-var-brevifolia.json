    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with greenish-yellow flowers that have a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial species with a rhizomatous root system, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
