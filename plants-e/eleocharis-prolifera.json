    "intro": "Eleocharis prolifera, commonly known as the common spike rush, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Eleocharis prolifera is often found in temperate regions and can thrive in both freshwater and brackish conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
