    "intro": "Ericoides capillare, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in pine forests or heathlands. Its flowers, typically pink or white, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ericoides capillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
