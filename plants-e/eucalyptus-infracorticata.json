    "intro": "Eucalyptus infracorticata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in thin strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for timber and fuel, while its aromatic oils have been used in traditional and modern applications."
