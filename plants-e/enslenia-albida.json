    "intro": "Enslenia albida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and sepals, which give it its ethereal appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically blooming during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Enslenia albida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
