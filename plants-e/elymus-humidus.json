    "intro": "Elymus humidus, commonly known as the wetland barley, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus humidus thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various wildlife species and its contribution to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
