    "intro": "Euphorbia schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendal's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a distinctive red or purple coloration, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Euphorbia schlechtendalii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight."
