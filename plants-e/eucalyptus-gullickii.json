    "intro": "Eucalyptus gullickii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing the seeds. Eucalyptus gullickii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a slow growth rate. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
