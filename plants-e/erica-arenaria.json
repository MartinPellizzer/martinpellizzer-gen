    "intro": "Erica arenaria, commonly known as the sand heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica arenaria plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
