    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli var. muricata, commonly known as cockleburgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and distinctive, spiny seed heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and is often considered a weed. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture. The seeds are enclosed in a spiny, three-lobed casing, which aids in their dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing."
