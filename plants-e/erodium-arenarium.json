    "intro": "Erodium arenarium, commonly known as sand eryngo, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It has small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom from spring to summer, and its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate saline conditions. Erodium arenarium plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
