    "intro": "Eugenia yumana, commonly known as the Yuma myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are small, red berries that ripen in late summer and are edible, though not widely consumed by humans. Eugenia yumana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in regions with low rainfall."
