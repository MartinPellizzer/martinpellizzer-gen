    "intro": "Echinocactus myriostigma subsp. quadricostatus, commonly known as the Mexican sunburst cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
