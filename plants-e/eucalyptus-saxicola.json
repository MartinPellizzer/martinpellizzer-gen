    "intro": "Eucalyptus saxicola, commonly known as the rock eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal white or pink flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus saxicola is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have various industrial and medicinal uses."
