    "intro": "Epilobium affine, commonly known as willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically pink or red, arranged in spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Epilobium affine is a perennial plant that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
