    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand hill scouring rush, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its presence indicates well-drained, often nutrient-poor environments."
