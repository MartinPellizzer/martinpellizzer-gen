    "intro": "Erica coruscans var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It typically reaches a height of about 10-20 centimeters, featuring compact, dense foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
