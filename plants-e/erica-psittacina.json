    "intro": "Erica psittacina, commonly known as the scarlet heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun exposure, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy environments. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its hardy and drought-resistant nature. Erica psittacina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
