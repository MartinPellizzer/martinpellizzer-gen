    "intro": "Epipactis etrusca, commonly known as the Etruscan helleborine, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces erect, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-yellow to brownish-purple flowers with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Epipactis etrusca is notable for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is often associated with calcareous soils."
