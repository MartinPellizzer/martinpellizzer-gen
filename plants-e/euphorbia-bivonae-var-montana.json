It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces unique, spiky flower clusters called cyathia, which are often yellow or orange in hue. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
