    "intro": "Eritrichium vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth form, adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, woolly, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Eritrichium vidalii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
