    "intro": "Euphorbia fructus-pini, commonly known as the pineapple euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features fleshy, spine-tipped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
