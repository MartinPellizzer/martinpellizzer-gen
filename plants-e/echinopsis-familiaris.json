    "intro": "Echinopsis familiaris, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Echinopsis familiaris is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance."
