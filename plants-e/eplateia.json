    "intro": "Eplateia, commonly known as the sweetroot or wild parsnip, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill. The plant features a tall, slender stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are fleshy and white, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, the plant contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
