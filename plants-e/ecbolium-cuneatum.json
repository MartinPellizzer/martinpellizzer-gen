    "intro": "Ecbolium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf ecbolium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its small, yellowish-white flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ecbolium cuneatum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
