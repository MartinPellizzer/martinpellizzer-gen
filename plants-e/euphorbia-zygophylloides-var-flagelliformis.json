    "intro": "Euphorbia zygophylloides var. flagelliformis, commonly known as the whipstick euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branched stem that resembles a whip, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are reduced to spines, giving it a unique and rugged appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
