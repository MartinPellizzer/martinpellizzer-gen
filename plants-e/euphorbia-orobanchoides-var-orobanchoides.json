    "intro": "Euphorbia orobanchoides var. orobanchoides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans if ingested."
