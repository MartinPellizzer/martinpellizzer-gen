    "intro": "Euonymus hukuangensis, commonly known as the Guangdong spurge or Hukou spurge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to China, particularly found in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
