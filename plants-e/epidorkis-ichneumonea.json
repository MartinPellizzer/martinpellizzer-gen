    "intro": "Epidorkis ichneumonea, commonly known as the common ichneumon wasp, is a species of parasitic wasp belonging to the family Ichneumonidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive coloration, often featuring a metallic green or black exoskeleton. The plant aspect of this species is not applicable, as it is an insect, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe. I can't reply."
