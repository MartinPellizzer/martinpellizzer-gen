It is characterized by its dark green, often velvety foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Epidendrum cleistogastrium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
