It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, and it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a silvery or grayish underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
