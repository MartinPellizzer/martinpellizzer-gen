    "intro": "Elaphoglossum squamiferum, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a perennial fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scaly structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum squamiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
