It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is often found in dry to semi-deciduous forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
