    "intro": "Eriocaulon macrocephalum, commonly known as the large-headed spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces distinctive, cylindrical seed capsules. Eriocaulon macrocephalum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
