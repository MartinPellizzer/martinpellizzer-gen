    "intro": "Epiphyllum oxypetalum, commonly known as the night bloomer or queen of the night, is a climbing cactus native to Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often segmented and adorned with spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or yellow. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Epiphyllum oxypetalum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
