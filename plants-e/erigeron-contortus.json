    "intro": "Erigeron contortus, commonly known as the twisted fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The leaves are usually hairy and have a twisted appearance, which gives the plant its common name."
