    "intro": "Epidendrum sculptum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the linear-leaved epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a distinctive, waxy bloom. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which are typically borne on pendant inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
