    "intro": "Ectozoma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. The plant has a unique structure with a slender, leafless stem that supports a single, delicate white or greenish-white flower. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ectozoma is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
