    "intro": "Ebermaiera spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed evergreen, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale yellow, and it produces berries that are edible for certain bird species. Due to its habitat specificity, Ebermaiera spatulata is considered a rare and less-studied plant in botanical research."
