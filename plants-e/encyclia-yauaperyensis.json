    "intro": "Encyclia yauaperyensis, commonly known as the Yauap\u00e9 orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air and rainwater in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
