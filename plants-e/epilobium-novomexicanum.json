It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Epilobium novomexicanum is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
