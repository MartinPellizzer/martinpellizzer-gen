    "intro": "Eulophia mahonii, commonly known as the Mahon's eulophia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. This terrestrial orchid features a pseudobulb-like stem with a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, showy flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically in shades of white, yellow, or green. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its beauty and unique floral structure."
