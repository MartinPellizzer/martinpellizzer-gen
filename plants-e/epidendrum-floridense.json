    "intro": "Epidendrum floridense, commonly known as the Florida Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners in humid climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
