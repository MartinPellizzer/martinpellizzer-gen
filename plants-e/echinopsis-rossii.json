    "intro": "Echinopsis rossii, commonly known as the Ross's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers during the warmer months, which bloom at night. Echinopsis rossii is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its low maintenance and ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive."
