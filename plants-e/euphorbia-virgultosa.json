    "intro": "Euphorbia virgultosa, commonly known as the Virgin's tears, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
