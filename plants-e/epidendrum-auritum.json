    "intro": "Epidendrum auritum, commonly known as the ear-shaped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive auricle-like appendages on the petals. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum auritum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
