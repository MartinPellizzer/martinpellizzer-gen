    "intro": "Epidendrum virescens, commonly known as the green epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Epidendrum virescens is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
