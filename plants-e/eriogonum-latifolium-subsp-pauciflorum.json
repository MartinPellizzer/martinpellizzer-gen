    "intro": "Eriogonum latifolium subsp. pauciflorum, commonly known as the broadleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and plains, and it is well adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native range. The subspecies pauciflorum is distinguished by its reduced flower number compared to other subspecies of Eriogonum latifolium."
