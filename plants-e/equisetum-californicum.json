    "intro": "Equisetum californicum, commonly known as California horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant native to the western United States. It features a distinctive appearance with whorled branches and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant contains silica, which gives it a rough, gritty texture and contributes to its historical use in polishing tools. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are located at the top of the plant and are a key feature in its reproductive cycle."
