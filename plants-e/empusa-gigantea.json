    "intro": "Empusa gigantea, commonly known as the giant shadow fern, is a striking plant characterized by its large, broad fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests and dense undergrowth. The plant's fronds are typically dark green with a velvety texture, and they exhibit a unique ability to absorb and retain moisture from the air. Empusa gigantea is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, which can span several decades. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor firmly in the soil while spreading vegetatively."
