    "intro": "Eleusine yemenica, commonly known as Yemen grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Eleusine yemenica is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some parts of its native range."
