    "intro": "Erica baccans, commonly known as the sweet heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers in late summer. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in well-drained, acidic conditions. Erica baccans is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal. It also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
