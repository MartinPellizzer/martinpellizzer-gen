    "intro": "Eugenia angophoroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and dull beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during late winter to early spring. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its strength and durability in construction and tool-making. The species is also noted for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
