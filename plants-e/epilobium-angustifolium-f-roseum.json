It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinguishing feature is its showy, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The inflorescence consists of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
