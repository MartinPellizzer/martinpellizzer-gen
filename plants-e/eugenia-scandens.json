    "intro": "Eugenia scandens, commonly known as the climbing myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Brazil and Mexico. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with twining stems that allow it to ascend trees or other structures. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy appearance. The small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pink, and the plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use."
