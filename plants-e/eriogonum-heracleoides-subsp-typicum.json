    "intro": "Eriogonum heracleoides subsp. typicum, commonly known as the California buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers and broad, ovate leaves. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid regions. This subspecies is an important component of local ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
