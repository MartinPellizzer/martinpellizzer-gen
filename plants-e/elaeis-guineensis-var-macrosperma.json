    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis var. macrosperma, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a species native to West Africa. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and produces fruit-bearing clusters called inflorescences. The plant is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same individual. Its seeds, encased in a fibrous husk, are the primary source of palm oil. The plant thrives in tropical climates and requires high temperatures and abundant rainfall for optimal growth."
