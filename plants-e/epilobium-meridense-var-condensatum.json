    "intro": "Epilobium meridense var. condensatum, commonly known as the dense willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. It produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
