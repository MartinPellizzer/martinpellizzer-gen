    "intro": "Erysimum euphraticum, commonly known as the Euphrates wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Erysimum euphraticum is often found in arid environments and is adapted to thrive in regions with limited rainfall."
