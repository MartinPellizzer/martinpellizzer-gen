    "intro": "Eugenia producta, commonly known as the fragrant guava, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe, containing a juicy, aromatic pulp. Eugenia producta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
