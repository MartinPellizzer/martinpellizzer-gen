    "intro": "Escobariopsis pennispinosa subsp. nazasensis, commonly known as the Nazas escobariopsis, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is endemic to specific regions in Mexico, where it thrives in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
