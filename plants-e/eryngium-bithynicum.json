    "intro": "Eryngium bithynicum, commonly known as the Bithynian thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are usually deeply lobed and covered with fine, bristly hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Eryngium bithynicum is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
