    "intro": "Epipactis tremolsii subsp. latina, commonly known as the Latvian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe, particularly Latvia and neighboring regions. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, leathery leaves that form a dense basal clump. The plant produces a tall, slender flowering stem bearing a single spike of greenish-white to pale yellow flowers, which are often hooded and have a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
