    "intro": "Epilobium parviflorum var. verticillatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, pink to purple flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom in early summer. This variant is distinguished by its narrow leaves and compact inflorescences compared to other epilobium species."
