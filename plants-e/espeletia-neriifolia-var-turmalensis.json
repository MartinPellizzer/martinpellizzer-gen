    "intro": "Espeletia neriifolia var. turmalensis, commonly known as the Turmal\u00edn espeletia, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit, with dense, woolly foliage that helps it survive in high-altitude, arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is adapted to cold temperatures and poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems."
