    "intro": "Eryngium longistylum, commonly known as the longstem thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple-blue flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as prairies and open woodlands. Its flowers are composed of many tiny florets arranged in a spherical shape, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eryngium longistylum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
