    "intro": "Endlicheria krukovii, commonly known as the Krukovii's endlicheria, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
