It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its fruits are small, round, and often contain a single seed, which is dispersed by animals. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat, contributing to biodiversity and providing resources for various wildlife species."
