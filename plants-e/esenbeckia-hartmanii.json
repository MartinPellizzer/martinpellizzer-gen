    "intro": "Esenbeckia hartmanii, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a distinctive crown of bracts beneath its flower heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range."
