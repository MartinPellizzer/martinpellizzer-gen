    "intro": "Eucalyptus polyanthemos subsp. vestita, commonly known as the White Mallee, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, cream-colored underbark. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
