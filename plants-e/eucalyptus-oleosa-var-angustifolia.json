    "intro": "Eucalyptus oleosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the season. It is a hardy shrub or small tree that thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. Due to its aromatic oils, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
