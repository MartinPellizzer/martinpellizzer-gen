    "intro": "Euphorbia multiceps, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a spiny, succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in sharp, green spines that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia multiceps is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
