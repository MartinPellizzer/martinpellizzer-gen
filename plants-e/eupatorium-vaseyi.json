    "intro": "Eupatorium vaseyi, commonly known as the Florida blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its foliage is usually finely divided and aromatic, with a silvery-white underside. Eupatorium vaseyi plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
