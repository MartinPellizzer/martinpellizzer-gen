It typically grows in dry, rocky, or mountainous regions and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and is often found in steppe and desert steppe ecosystems. Elytrigia ferganensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
