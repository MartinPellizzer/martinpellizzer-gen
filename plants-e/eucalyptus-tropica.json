    "intro": "Eucalyptus tropica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its bark is often fissured and peels in strips, and it is adapted to withstand drought and fire. Eucalyptus tropica plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
