    "intro": "Eryngium fontanum, commonly known as the water thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles, and its hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along stream banks and in damp meadows. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eryngium fontanum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can also serve as a habitat for various insects."
