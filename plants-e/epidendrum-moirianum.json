It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive purple lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum moirianum prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
