    "intro": "Encholirium crassiscapum, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, covered in dense, woolly spines. The plant produces large, white or yellow flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by insects and bats. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. Encholirium crassiscapum is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat."
