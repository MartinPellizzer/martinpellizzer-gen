    "intro": "Euphorbia urceolophora, commonly known as the cup-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are fleshy and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia urceolophora is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
