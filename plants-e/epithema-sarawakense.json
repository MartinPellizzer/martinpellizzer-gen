    "intro": "Epithema sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak epiphyte, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features small, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy layers of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
