    "intro": "Eriogonum hirtiflorum, commonly known as the hairyflower buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open landscapes. Eriogonum hirtiflorum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
