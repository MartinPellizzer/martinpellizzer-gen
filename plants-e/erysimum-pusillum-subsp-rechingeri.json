It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
