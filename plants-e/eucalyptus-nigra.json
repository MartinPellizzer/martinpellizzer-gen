    "intro": "Eucalyptus nigra, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-gray hue when young. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale green, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
