    "intro": "Equisetum fontinale, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a primitive plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, a feature typical of many ancient plant species. It thrives in moist, often aquatic environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Its presence indicates a habitat with high water content and nutrient-rich soil."
