    "intro": "Eremostachys rastagalensis, commonly known as the Rastagol sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Eremostachys rastagalensis is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
