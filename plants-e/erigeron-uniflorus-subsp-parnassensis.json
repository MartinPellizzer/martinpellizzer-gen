    "intro": "Erigeron uniflorus subsp. parnassensis, commonly known as Parnassian fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale blue to white, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
