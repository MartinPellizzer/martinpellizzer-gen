It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with three deep lobes, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found near rivers or in disturbed soils. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature."
