    "intro": "Eustachys mutica, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Eustachys mutica is also valued for its ability to filter water and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
