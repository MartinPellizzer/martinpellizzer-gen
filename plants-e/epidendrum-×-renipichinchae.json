    "intro": "Epidendrum \u00d7 renipichinchae, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Epidendrum renifolium and Epidendrum pichinchae. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes region of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of white or grayish hair, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. This hybrid is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and adaptability to a range of growing conditions."
