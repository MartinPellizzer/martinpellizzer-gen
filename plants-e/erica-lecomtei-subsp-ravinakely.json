    "intro": "Erica lecomtei subsp. ravinakely, commonly known as the Ravinakely heath, is a rare and endemic shrub found in the limestone grasslands of Madagascar. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the late dry season, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
