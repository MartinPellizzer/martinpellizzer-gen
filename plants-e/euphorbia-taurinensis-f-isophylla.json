    "intro": "Euphorbia taurinensis f. isophylla, commonly known as the Isophylla euphorbia, is a rare and unique variant of the Euphorbia taurinensis species. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring reduced, scale-like leaves that are clustered closely around the stems. This succulent plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a branched stem system and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native environment."
