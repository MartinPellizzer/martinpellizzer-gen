It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, nut-like fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential as a food source, it is cultivated in some regions for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
