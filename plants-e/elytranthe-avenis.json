It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental leaves, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
