    "intro": "Evacopsis heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to form extensive root systems to attach to host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
