    "intro": "Ebermaiera diffusa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, reddish-bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in tropical ecosystems, though it is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
