    "intro": "Euonymus porphyreus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
