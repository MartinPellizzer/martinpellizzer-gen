    "intro": "Echinocactus cachetianus, commonly known as the Cachetianus barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that is typically green with a spiny exterior. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the top of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
