    "intro": "Eucalyptus amplifolia subsp. amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed mallees, is a subshrub or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its lanceolate to ovate leaves, which are often coated with a fine, whitish bloom. The flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are usually pale blue to white in color. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
