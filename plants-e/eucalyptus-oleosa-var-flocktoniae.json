    "intro": "Eucalyptus oleosa var. flocktoniae, commonly known as the Flockton's malleable, is a rare and unique variant of the eucalyptus genus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
