    "intro": "Echinopsis gemmata var. decaisneana, commonly known as the Decaisne's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and prominent spines, which are often a striking blue or white color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a dramatic contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and rock gardens."
