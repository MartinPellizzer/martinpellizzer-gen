    "intro": "Epipactis palustris, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is a perennial herb that produces a single flower per stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The marsh helleborine is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
