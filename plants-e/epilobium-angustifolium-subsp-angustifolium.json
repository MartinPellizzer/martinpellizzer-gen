    "intro": "Epilobium angustifolium subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks, wet meadows, and roadside areas. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to red flowers appear in clusters at the tips of the stems, blooming from late spring to early summer. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
