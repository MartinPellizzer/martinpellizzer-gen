It is a herbaceous annual plant with slender, branching stems and vibrant orange to red flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found along ocean shores and dunes. This variety is notable for its resilience to coastal winds and salt spray."
