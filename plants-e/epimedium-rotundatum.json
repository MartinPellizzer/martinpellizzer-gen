    "intro": "Epimedium rotundatum, commonly known as barrenwort, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Epimedium rotundatum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
