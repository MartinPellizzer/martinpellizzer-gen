    "intro": "Echinopsis antezanae, commonly known as the Antezana's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of white spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
