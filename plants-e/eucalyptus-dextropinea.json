    "intro": "Eucalyptus dextropinea, commonly known as the red mahogany gum, is a tall, slender tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color beneath, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The tree produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and its essential oils are known for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
