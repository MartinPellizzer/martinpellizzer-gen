It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces pendulous flower spikes with showy, colorful flowers that range from red to orange and yellow. Its roots are typically fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Epidendrum guttatum is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
