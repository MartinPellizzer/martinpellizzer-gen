It is characterized by its smooth, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.
