    "intro": "Echinomastus mapimiensis, commonly known as the Mapimi cactus, is a unique species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a small, spiny cactus characterized by its compact growth and dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has a short, thick stem covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
