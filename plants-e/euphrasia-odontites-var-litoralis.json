    "intro": "Euphrasia odontites var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal eyebright, is a variant of the eyebright plant adapted to coastal environments. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in coastal dunes or cliff habitats. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
