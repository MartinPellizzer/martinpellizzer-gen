    "intro": "Eleocharis radicans, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
