    "intro": "Erodium triangulare subsp. pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty erodium, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive triangular shape and a pubescent surface that gives it a dusty appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
