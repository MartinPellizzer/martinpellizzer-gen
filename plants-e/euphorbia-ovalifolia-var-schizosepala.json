    "intro": "Euphorbia ovalifolia var. schizosepala, commonly known as the Schizosepala spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbia genus, and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and resilience."
