    "intro": "Euphorbia mlanjeana, commonly known as the Mlanje spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive dry conditions. The plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
