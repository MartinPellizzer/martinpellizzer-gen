    "intro": "Erica secundiflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica secundiflora is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
