    "intro": "Euceraea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver or grayish foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Euceraea species are native to parts of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
