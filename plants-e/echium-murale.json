    "intro": "Echium murale, commonly known as the wall echium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Echium murale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
