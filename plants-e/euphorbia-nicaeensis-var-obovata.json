    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis var. obovata, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are obovate in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
