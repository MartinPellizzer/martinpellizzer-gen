    "intro": "Eria sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss, Eria sumatrana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
