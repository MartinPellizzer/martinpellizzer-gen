It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive red or purple berries that contain a single seed, and it is closely related to other Eugenia species found in tropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
