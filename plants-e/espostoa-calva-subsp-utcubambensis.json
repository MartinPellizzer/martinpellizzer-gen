    "intro": "Espostoa calva subsp. utcubambensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian espostoa, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and milky sap-producing plants. The species is characterized by its slender, erect stem and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by follicles containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
