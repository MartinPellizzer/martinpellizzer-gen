    "intro": "Eurya chuekiangensis, commonly known as the Chinese holly or Chinese waxleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Eurya chuekiangensis is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
