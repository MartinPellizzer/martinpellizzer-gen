    "intro": "Elvira martyni, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Elvira martyni plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
