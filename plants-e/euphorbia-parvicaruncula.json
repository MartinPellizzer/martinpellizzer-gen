    "intro": "Euphorbia parvicaruncula, commonly known as the dwarf bristly spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its slow growth and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
