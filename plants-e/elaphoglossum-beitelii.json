It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden landscapes."
