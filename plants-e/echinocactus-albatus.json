    "intro": "Echinocactus albatus, commonly known as the white hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in white, spiny areoles that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on elongated pedicels. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Echinocactus albatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
