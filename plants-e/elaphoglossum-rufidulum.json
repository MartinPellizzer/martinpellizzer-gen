It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a reddish-brown hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Elaphoglossum rufidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
