    "intro": "Epipactis neerlandica, commonly known as the Dutch helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that produces a single flower per stem, usually in late spring or early summer. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in acidic soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
