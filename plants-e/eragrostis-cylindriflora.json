It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period usually occurs during the dry season, and it is adapted to arid environments. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
