    "intro": "Eugenia cupulata, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible, pinkish-red fruits that are highly valued for their sweet, aromatic flavor. Its botanical features include a smooth, grayish-brown bark and woody, spiny thorns on the stems. Eugenia cupulata is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its nutritious fruit."
