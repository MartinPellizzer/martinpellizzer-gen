    "intro": "Euphorbia descampsii, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though the true flowers are small and inconspicuous. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Euphorbia descampsii is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
