It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green color. It thrives in dry, temperate climates and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Elymus kuznetzovii is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
