    "intro": "Euphorbia fruticulosa var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its hairy texture helps reduce water loss and protects it from intense sunlight."
