    "intro": "Eriogonum ammophilum, commonly known as the sandberg's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum ammophilum plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
