    "intro": "Eucalyptus parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, blooming during the winter months. Its bark is typically smooth and ranges in color from grey to white, often peeling in thin strips. Eucalyptus parvifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suited to dry conditions."
