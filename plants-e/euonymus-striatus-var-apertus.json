    "intro": "Euonymus striatus var. apertus, commonly known as the spreading euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in the spring, followed by red, inflated seed capsules that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The varietal form 'apertus' is distinguished by its more open growth habit compared to other varieties."
