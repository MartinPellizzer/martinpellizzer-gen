    "intro": "Erlangea fruticosa, commonly known as the golden thimble cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive, cap-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Erlangea fruticosa is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant."
