It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and seasonal interest."
