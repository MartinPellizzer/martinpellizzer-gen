    "intro": "Euphorbia subpeltata, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a cylindrical, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Euphorbia subpeltata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
