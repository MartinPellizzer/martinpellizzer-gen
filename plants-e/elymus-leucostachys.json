    "intro": "Elymus leucostachys, commonly known as silver wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with green or reddish hues. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Silver wheatgrass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
