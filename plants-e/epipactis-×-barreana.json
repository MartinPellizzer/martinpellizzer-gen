    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 barreana, commonly known as the hybrid marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with purple markings. The plant typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Epipactis \u00d7 barreana is a natural hybrid between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis purpurea, exhibiting traits from both parent species. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as an indicator species for wetland health."
