    "intro": "Eriophyllum monoense, commonly known as the coast goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salty air and strong winds. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Eriophyllum monoense is often used in native plant gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
