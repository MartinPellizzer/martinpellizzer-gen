    "intro": "Elymus innovatus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, flat leaves and a dense growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid environments."
