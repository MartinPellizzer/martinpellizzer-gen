    "intro": "Eriophyllum pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's eriophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Eriophyllum pringlei is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
