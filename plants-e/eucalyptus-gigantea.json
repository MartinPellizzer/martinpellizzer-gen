    "intro": "Eucalyptus gigantea, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a tall, slender tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The tree is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands."
