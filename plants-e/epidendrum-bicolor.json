    "intro": "Epidendrum bicolor, commonly known as the Two-Colored Vanda, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its strikingly contrasting coloration on its flowers. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped blooms that typically feature a white base with a deep red or purple tip. Epidendrum bicolor is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
