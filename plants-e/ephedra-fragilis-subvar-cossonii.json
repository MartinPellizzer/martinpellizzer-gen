    "intro": "Ephedra fragilis subvar. cossonii, commonly known as the fragrant ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often reduced to minute structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, followed by small, woody capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. This subspecies is noted for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in some indigenous cultures for various purposes."
