    "intro": "Edechia, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most notably Edechia coccinea, which is native to tropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Edechia species typically have a short, thick rhizome and produce small, inconspicuous true flowers clustered within a spadix. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their vibrant foliage and unique appearance."
