    "intro": "Eulalia, commonly known as the bottlebrush grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, composed of dense clusters of red or pink bracts. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Eulalia species typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often with narrow, grass-like leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
