    "intro": "Eria rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in rocky or coastal environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, delicate orchid-like flowers in shades of white and pink. It is often found growing on cliffs or in sandy soils, where it adapts to harsh, well-drained conditions. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
