It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, allowing it to survive in seasonal climates. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces striking, hooded flowers with a distinctive color pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Eulophia vaginata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
