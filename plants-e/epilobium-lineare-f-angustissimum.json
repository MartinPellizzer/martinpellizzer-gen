    "intro": "Epilobium lineare f. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The flowers are typically arranged in spike-like clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
