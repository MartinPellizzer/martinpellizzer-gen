    "intro": "Euphorbia valida, commonly known as the white-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in white, waxy spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, with some varieties having broader, fleshy leaves at the base. Euphorbia valida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
