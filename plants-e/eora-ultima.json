    "intro": "Eora ultima, commonly known as the twilight orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically growing at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. The plant features delicate, elongated leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers, which bloom only at night, are pale violet with intricate patterns that resemble celestial constellations. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Eora ultima is classified as an endangered species."
