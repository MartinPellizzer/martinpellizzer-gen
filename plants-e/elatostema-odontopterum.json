    "intro": "Elatostema odontopterum, commonly known as the toothed elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, commonly known as the nettle family, and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies or in swampy areas. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive toothed or serrated margin, which contributes to its common name. Elatostema odontopterum produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
