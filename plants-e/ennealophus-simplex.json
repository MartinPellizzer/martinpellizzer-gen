    "intro": "Ennealophus simplex, commonly known as the simple leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, undivided leaves that are typically elongated and pinnately arranged. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ennealophus simplex plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystem."
