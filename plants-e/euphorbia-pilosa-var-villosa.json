    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems and leaves. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to North America, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the genus Euphorbia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a landscape plant."
