    "intro": "Epidendrum bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian Epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features showy, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum bolivianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
