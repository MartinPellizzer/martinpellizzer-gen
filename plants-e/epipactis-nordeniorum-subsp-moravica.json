    "intro": "Epipactis nordeniorum subsp. moravica, commonly known as the Moravian helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
