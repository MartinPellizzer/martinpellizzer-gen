    "intro": "Epilobium nerterioides var. minimum, commonly known as dwarf willow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover or in water features."
