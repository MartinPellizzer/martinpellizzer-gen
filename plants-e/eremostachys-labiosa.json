    "intro": "Eremostachys labiosa, commonly known as the pink spurge or pink-flowered eremostachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Eremostachys labiosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
