    "intro": "Ephedra pedunculata, commonly known as the slender ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Ephedra pedunculata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems and reduce transpiration. It is also noted for its historical use in traditional medicine."
