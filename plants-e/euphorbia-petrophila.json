    "intro": "Euphorbia petrophila, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces unique, spiny inflorescences that contain yellowish-green flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia petrophila is well-suited to rocky soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient example of desert flora."
