    "intro": "Euphorbia vajravelui var. theniensis, commonly known as the Theni Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern India. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. This variant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species."
