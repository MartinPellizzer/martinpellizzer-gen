    "intro": "Eugenia linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Eugenia linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens."
