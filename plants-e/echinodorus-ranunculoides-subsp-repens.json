    "intro": "Echinodorus ranunculoides subsp. repens, commonly known as the wandering waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to South America. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. This species is well adapted to slow-moving or still freshwater environments, where it can spread vegetatively through stolons. It is often used in aquascaping due to its dense growth habit and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental and ecological valuable plant in freshwater ecosystems."
