    "intro": "Eremostachys leiocalyx, commonly known as the woolly golden sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Eremostachys leiocalyx is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
