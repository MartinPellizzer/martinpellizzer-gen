It is characterized by its large, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a short, cylindrical stem with spiny areoles, and its leaves are typically reduced to spines. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments.
