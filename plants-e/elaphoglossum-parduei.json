    "intro": "Elaphoglossum parduei, commonly known as the Pardue's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, evergreen fronds that exhibit a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
