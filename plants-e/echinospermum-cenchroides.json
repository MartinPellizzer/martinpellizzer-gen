It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are arranged in compact clusters and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
