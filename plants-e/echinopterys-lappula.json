    "intro": "Echinopterys lappula, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant belonging to the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and its fruit is a dry, pod-like structure containing several seeds. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Echinopterys lappula is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability."
