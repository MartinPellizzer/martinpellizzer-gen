    "intro": "Euphorbia ankarensis, commonly known as the Ankarensis spurges, is a succulent plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
