    "intro": "Espeletia divisoriensis, commonly known as the Andean heather, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Espeletia divisoriensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
