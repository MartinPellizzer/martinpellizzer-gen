    "intro": "Eremostachys karatavica, commonly known as the Karatavica eremostachys, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it survive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, blooming in late summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Eremostachys karatavica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
