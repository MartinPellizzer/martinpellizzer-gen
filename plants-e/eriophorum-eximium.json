    "intro": "Eriophorum eximium, commonly known as the slender cotton-grass, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, white to pinkish plumes that resemble cotton, which are composed of tiny, scale-like bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these harsh environments. Eriophorum eximium is also an important food source for certain pollinators and small herbivores."
