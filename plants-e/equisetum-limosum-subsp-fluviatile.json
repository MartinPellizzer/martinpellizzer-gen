    "intro": "Equisetum limosum subsp. fluviatile, commonly known as water horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically bright green and covered with small spore-producing structures called strobila. This subspecies thrives in wet, nutrient-rich soils, often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
