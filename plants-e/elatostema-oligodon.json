    "intro": "Elatostema oligodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers. It produces small, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. Elatostema oligodon is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
