    "intro": "Elymus subfibrosus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Elymus subfibrosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid habitats."
