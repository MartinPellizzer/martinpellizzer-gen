    "intro": "Epidendrum marmoratum, commonly known as the marble orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, marbled-patterned leaves that often feature a mix of green, white, and silver hues. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in racemes along the stems. Epidendrum marmoratum is a pseudobulbous plant, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
