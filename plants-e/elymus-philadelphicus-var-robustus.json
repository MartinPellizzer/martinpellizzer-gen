    "intro": "Elymus philadelphicus var. robustus, commonly known as the robust wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, upright stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
