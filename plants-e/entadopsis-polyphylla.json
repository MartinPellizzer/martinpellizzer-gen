    "intro": "Entadopsis polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved entadopsis, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and its clusters of vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires specific care to thrive. Entadopsis polyphylla is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
