    "intro": "Embothrium polystachyum, commonly known as the Chilean firetree, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Embothrium polystachyum is well adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments, often thriving in sandy or rocky soils."
