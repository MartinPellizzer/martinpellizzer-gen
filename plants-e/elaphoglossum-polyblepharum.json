    "intro": "Elaphoglossum polyblepharum, commonly known as the many-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum polyblepharum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like foliage."
