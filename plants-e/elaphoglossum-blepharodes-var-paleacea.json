    "intro": "Elaphoglossum blepharodes var. paleacea, commonly known as the pale fringed holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves with a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration and unique leaf morphology, making it a distinctive species within the genus Elaphoglossum."
