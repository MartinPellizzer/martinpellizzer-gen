    "intro": "Epidendrum cordiforme, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum cordiforme is relatively easy to care for and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
