    "intro": "Euphorbia watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has modified leaves that serve as spines, providing protection from herbivores. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Euphorbia watsonii is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun conditions."
