It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistle-like structures. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Eryngium echinatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
