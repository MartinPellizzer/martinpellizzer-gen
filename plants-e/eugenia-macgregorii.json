    "intro": "Eugenia macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's clove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight aromatic scent. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by aromatic, peppery red berries. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
