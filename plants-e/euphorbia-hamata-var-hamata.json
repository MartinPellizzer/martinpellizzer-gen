    "intro": "Euphorbia hamata var. hamata, commonly known as the Spineless Milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
