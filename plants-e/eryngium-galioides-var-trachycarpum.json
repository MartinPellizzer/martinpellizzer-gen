    "intro": "Eryngium galioides var. trachycarpum, commonly known as the rough-seeded thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple to violet flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant produces small, bracted flowers that are typically clustered in dense, conical inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, waxy surfaces and serrated edges. The variety trachycarpum is distinguished by its more robust growth and coarser texture compared to other varieties of Eryngium galioides."
