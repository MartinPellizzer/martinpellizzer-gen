    "intro": "Eragrostis panicoides, commonly known as bush bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-gray foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the summer months. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, pastures, and disturbed sites. Eragrostis panicoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
