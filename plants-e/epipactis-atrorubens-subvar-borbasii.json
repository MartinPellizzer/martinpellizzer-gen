    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens subvar. borbasii, commonly known as the Borbas' harebell, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple to reddish-brown flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a unique shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in the presence of specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy coating, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
