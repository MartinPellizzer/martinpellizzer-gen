    "intro": "Ertela trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Ertela trifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
