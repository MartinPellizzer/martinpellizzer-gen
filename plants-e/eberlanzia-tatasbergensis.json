    "intro": "Eberlanzia tatasbergensis, commonly known as the Tatasberg evergreen, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
