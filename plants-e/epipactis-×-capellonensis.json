    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 capellonensis, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine. It is a perennial herb with tall, slender stems that bear dense, dark green, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a spike of small, pale green to brown flowers, which are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Epipactis \u00d7 capellonensis is primarily found in Europe and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
