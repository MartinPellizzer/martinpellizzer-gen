    "intro": "Eupritchardia pericularum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a rare shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, palmate leaves, and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests and alpine meadows. Its flowers are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eupritchardia pericularum is considered a species of conservation concern."
