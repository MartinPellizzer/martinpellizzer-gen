    "intro": "Eleocharis elliptica var. pseudoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its morphology is adapted for efficient water dispersion and survival in fluctuating water levels."
