    "intro": "Echeveria pusilla, commonly known as the miniature echeveria or dwarf echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray to green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners seeking compact, drought-tolerant plants."
