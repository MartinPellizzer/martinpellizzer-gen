    "intro": "Euphorbia magnicapsula var. magnicapsula, commonly known as the giant capsule euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, followed by large, round seed capsules that give it its common name. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
