It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in rice paddies and other cultivated fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its status as a problematic invasive species in some regions."
