    "intro": "Eupatorium herzogii, commonly known as Herzog's boneset, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
