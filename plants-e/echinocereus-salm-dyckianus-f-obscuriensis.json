It features a distinctive dark green to reddish stem with spiny areoles, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
