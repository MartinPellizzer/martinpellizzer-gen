    "intro": "Exodiclis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf exodiclis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, tropical forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
