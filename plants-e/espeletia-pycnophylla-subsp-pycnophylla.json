    "intro": "Espeletia pycnophylla subsp. pycnophylla, commonly known as the Santa Marta alpine plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in the arid, cold environments where it grows. The plant typically forms compact rosettes and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early spring. It is adapted to the extreme conditions of the Andean p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
