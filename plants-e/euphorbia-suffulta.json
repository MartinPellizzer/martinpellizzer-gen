    "intro": "Euphorbia suffulta, commonly known as the giant pincushion plant, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
