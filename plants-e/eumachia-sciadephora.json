    "intro": "Eumachia sciadephora, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are tubular and have five petals, with prominent stamens that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Eumachia sciadephora is often cultivated for its beauty and is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
