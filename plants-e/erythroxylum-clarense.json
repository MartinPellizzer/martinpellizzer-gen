    "intro": "Erythroxylum clarense, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, red flowers. The plant produces bright orange to red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
