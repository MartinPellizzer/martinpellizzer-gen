It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.
