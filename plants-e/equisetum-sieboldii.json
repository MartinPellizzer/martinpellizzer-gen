    "intro": "Equisetum sieboldii, commonly known as Japanese horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in the spring. Equisetum sieboldii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient appearance and primitive structure make it a living fossil with significant ecological and botanical interest."
