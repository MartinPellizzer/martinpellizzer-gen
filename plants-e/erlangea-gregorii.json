    "intro": "Erlangea gregorii, commonly known as the Gregorii's erlang, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erlangea gregorii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
