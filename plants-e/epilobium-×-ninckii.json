    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 ninckii, commonly known as the hybrid willowherb, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Epilobium \u00d7 ninckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
