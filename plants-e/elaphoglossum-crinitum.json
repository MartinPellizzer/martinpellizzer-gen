    "intro": "Elaphoglossum crinitum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. Native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns."
