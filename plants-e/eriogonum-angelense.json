    "intro": "Eriogonum angelense, commonly known as Angel's flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Eriogonum angelense is a hardy perennial that plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
