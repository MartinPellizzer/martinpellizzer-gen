    "intro": "Elymus antarcticus f. agroelymoides, commonly known as the Antarctic wild rye, is a grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. It is native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in South America and Antarctica. This variety is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil nutrients. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in extreme environments."
