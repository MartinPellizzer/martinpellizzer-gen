    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longifolium f. genuina, commonly known as the Pacific Northwest fern, is a rare fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
