    "intro": "Eupatorium stigmatosum, commonly known as roughleaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features opposite, rough-textured leaves with a silvery underside, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in the summer. Its flowering period attracts various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Eupatorium stigmatosum is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
