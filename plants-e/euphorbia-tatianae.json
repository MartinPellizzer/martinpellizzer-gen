    "intro": "Euphorbia tatianae, commonly known as the Tatiana's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, thick stem with numerous small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive dry conditions. Euphorbia tatianae is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
