    "intro": "Eleusine geminata, commonly known as false rice, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts. Its seeds are similar in appearance to rice grains, which can lead to confusion in agricultural settings. Eleusine geminata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated fields."
