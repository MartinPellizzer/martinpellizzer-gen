    "intro": "Euphorbia lemaireana, commonly known as the Lemaire's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Euphorbia lemaireana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
