    "intro": "Eriocaulon pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soft substrates, while its compact size allows it to thrive in limited spaces. Eriocaulon pygmaeum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
