    "intro": "Erigeron wightianus, commonly known as Wight's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and it thrives in full sun. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
