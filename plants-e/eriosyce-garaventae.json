    "intro": "Eriosyce garaventae, commonly known as the Garaventa lichen cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Cactaceae family and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, bloom during the rainy season. Eriosyce garaventae is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, where it can retain moisture."
