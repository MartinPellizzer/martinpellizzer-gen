    "intro": "Eleocharis tenuis var. borealis, commonly known as the northern spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as bogs and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, and its tiny, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous small, pale flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Due to its preference for moist environments, it is often found in areas with consistent water levels."
