    "intro": "Epipactis autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex root system and produces small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind. Epipactis autumnalis is a member of the orchid family and exhibits mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient uptake."
