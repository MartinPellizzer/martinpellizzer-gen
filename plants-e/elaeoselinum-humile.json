    "intro": "Elaeoselinum humile, commonly known as the dwarf elephant's foot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Elaeoselinum humile is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
