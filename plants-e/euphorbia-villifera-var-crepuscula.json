    "intro": "Euphorbia villifera var. crepuscula, commonly known as the evening euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to rocky, well-drained soils."
