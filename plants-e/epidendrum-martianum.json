    "intro": "Epidendrum martianum, commonly known as the Martian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, colorful flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum martianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
