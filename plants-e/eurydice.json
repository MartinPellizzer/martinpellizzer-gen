    "intro": "Eurydice, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plumbaginaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. They are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers and silvery-gray foliage. Eurydice species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal and hardiness. The genus includes several species, such as Eurydice glabra and Eurydice maritima, which are well-adapted to maritime climates."
