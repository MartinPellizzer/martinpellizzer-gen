    "intro": "Eleocharis flexifolia, commonly known as soft-stemmed spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, flexible stems that are often covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are surrounded by a series of bracts. Eleocharis flexifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
