    "intro": "Eupatorium hemisphaericum var. molliusculum, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple to violet flower heads that resemble small cones, which are composed of numerous tiny tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and swamps, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive silvery or grayish underside. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
