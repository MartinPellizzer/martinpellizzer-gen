    "intro": "Erica subcapitata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Erica subcapitata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
