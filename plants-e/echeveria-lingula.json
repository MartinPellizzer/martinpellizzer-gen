    "intro": "Echeveria lingula, commonly known as the silver chalice, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. The leaves are typically blue-gray to silver-green in color, and the plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and striking foliage make it a desirable ornamental plant."
