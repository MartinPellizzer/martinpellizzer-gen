    "intro": "Echeveria cuencaensis, commonly known as the Cuencaensis Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces showy clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
