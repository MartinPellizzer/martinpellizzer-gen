    "intro": "Eriophorum gracile subsp. coreanum, commonly known as the slender cotton grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences composed of tiny, white to pale brown flowers, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of marshes. Its slender stems and small, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand wet and cold conditions. The subspecies coreanum is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Eriophorum gracile."
