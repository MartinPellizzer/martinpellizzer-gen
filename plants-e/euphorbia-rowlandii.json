    "intro": "Euphorbia rowlandii, commonly known as the milkweed tree, is a spiny, shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia rowlandii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
