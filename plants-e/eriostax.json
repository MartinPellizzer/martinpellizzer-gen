    "intro": "Eriostax, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, capsule-like fruit, which aids in seed dispersal. Eriostax is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
