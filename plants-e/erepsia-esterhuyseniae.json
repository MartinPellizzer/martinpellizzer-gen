It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypsela. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
