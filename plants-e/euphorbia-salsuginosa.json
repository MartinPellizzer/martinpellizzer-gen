    "intro": "Euphorbia salsuginosa, commonly known as the snowflake euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces striking yellow-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners."
