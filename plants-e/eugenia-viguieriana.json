    "intro": "Eugenia viguieriana, commonly known as the Viguier's eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. After flowering, it produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates."
