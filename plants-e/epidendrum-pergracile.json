    "intro": "Epidendrum pergracile, commonly known as the slender epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. Epidendrum pergracile is also known for its ability to adapt to a variety of growing conditions, making it a versatile addition to orchid collections."
