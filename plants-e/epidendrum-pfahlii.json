    "intro": "Epidendrum pfahlii, commonly known as the Flamingo Flower, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescences that resemble the pink and orange hues of a flamingo. The plant produces numerous small, fragrant flowers arranged in a loose raceme, often with contrasting color patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pfahlii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
