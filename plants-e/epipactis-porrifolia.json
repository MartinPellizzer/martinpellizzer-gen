    "intro": "Epipactis porrifolia, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and moist woodlands in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow lip and intricate patterns. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, and it thrives in shaded, damp environments. Epipactis porrifolia is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
