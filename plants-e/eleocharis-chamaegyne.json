    "intro": "Eleocharis chamaegyne, commonly known as the dwarf spike rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of slender, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Eleocharis chamaegyne is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
