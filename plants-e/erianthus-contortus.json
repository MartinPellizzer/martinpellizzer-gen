    "intro": "Erianthus contortus, commonly known as the twisted reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it blooms in the summer months. Erianthus contortus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
