    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia subsp. helioscopioides, commonly known as the sun spurge, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a characteristic common among many species in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies."
