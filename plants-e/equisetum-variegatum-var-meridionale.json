    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum var. meridionale, commonly known as the southern variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically green with a faintly yellowish tint. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Equisetum. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is less common than the typical form of Equisetum variegatum and is native to southern regions of Europe and western Asia."
