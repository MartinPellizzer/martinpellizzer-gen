It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and bees. The tree has compound leaves composed of three to five elliptical leaflets, and its bark is often smooth with a reddish hue. It produces pods containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
