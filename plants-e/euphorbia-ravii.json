    "intro": "Euphorbia ravii, commonly known as the St. George's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia ravii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
