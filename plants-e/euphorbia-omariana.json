    "intro": "Euphorbia omariana, commonly known as the Somali euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the dry regions of East Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small and may be reduced or absent in some varieties. Euphorbia omariana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
