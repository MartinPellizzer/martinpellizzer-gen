    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. transatlanticum, commonly known as the Transatlantic bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, pinkish to purple flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. This annual herb typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread. The plant is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential ecological roles and medicinal properties."
