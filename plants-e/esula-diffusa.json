    "intro": "Esula diffusa, commonly known as the spreading euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a branched stem system that spreads horizontally, often forming a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritant. Esula diffusa is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability."
