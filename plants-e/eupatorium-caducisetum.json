    "intro": "Eupatorium caducisetum, commonly known as the slender thoroughwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium caducisetum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
