    "intro": "Erica tricolor, commonly known as the three-color heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in spring and early summer. Erica tricolor is evergreen, with compact, leathery leaves that form dense, low-growing shrubs. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
