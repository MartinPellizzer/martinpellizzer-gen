    "intro": "Erigeron alpinus proles neglectus, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with blue to violet petals and yellow centers, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-tolerant nature."
