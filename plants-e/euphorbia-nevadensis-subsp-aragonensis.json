    "intro": "Euphorbia nevadensis subsp. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon devil's backbone, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater. This species is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry, hot climates."
