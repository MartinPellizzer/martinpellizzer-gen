It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and swampy areas. Eupatorium foliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
