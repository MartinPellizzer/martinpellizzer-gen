    "intro": "Euphorbia confinalis, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
