    "intro": "Euonymus benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet euonymus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
