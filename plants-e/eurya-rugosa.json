It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, orange-red berries in the fall. Eurya rugosa is often found in moist, acidic soils in forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
