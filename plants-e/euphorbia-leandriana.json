    "intro": "Euphorbia leandriana, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, woody stem covered in a layer of white, powdery wax that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be shed during periods of drought. Euphorbia leandriana is known for its ability to store water in its stem, making it well adapted to arid environments."
