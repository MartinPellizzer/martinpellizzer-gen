    "intro": "Elymus subulatus, commonly known as the needlegrass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Elymus subulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
