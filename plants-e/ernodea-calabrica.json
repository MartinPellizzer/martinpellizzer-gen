    "intro": "Ernodea calabrica, commonly known as the Calabar bean plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for containing potent alkaloids, particularly the toxin physostigmine, which has been used in medicinal applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
