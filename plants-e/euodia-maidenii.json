    "intro": "Euodia maidenii, commonly known as the Sydney pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits that contain several seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often exfoliating to reveal a reddish inner layer. Euodia maidenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
