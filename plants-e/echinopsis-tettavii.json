    "intro": "Echinopsis tettavii, commonly known as the Tettavii cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
