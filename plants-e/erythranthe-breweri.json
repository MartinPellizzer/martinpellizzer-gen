    "intro": "Erythranthe breweri, commonly known as Brewer's erythranthe, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as streambanks and meadows. It produces small, bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
