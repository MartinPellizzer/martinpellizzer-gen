    "intro": "Eriogonum vimineum subsp. nidularium, commonly known as the bird's-nest buckwheat, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, urn-shaped seed pods that resemble bird's nests, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland valleys. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
