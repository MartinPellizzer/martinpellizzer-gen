    "intro": "Ericoides minutissimum, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features tiny, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax layer, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring or early summer. Ericoides minutissimum is well adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cool, moist climates."
