It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct ridge, giving it its common name. Eleocharis carinata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
