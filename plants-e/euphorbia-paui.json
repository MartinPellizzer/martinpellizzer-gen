    "intro": "Euphorbia paui, commonly known as the Pau Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Pau, in the Comoros archipelago. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euphorbia paui is considered a rare and endangered species."
