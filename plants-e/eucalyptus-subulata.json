    "intro": "Eucalyptus subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus subulata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
