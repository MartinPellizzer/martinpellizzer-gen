    "intro": "Epidendrum prostratum, commonly known as the flat-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in humus-rich soil near streams or in dense undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique appearance and delicate blooms."
