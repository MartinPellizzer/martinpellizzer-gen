    "intro": "Euphorbia mitis, commonly known as the soft spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia mitis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
