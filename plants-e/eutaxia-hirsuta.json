The plant features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Eutaxia hirsuta is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
