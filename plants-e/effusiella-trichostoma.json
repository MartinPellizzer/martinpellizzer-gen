    "intro": "Effusiella trichostoma, commonly known as the hairy liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct central axis and is covered in fine, hairy structures called rhizoids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from small, capsule-like structures called sporangia. Effusiella trichostoma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
