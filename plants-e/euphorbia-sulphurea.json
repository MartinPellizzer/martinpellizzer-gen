    "intro": "Euphorbia sulphurea, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often tinged with yellow or green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation. Euphorbia sulphurea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments."
