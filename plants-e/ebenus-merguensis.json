    "intro": "Ebenus merguensis, commonly known as the Sudanese thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange pulp. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Ebenus merguensis is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
