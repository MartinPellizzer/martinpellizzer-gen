It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, willow-like leaves and clusters of pink or reddish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra or subarctic environments. Epilobium dawbinii is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, with flowering occurring in late spring to early summer. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a component of high-altitude vegetation communities."
