    "intro": "Encyclia nemoralis, commonly known as the woodland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Encyclia nemoralis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
