    "intro": "Eriosyce islayensis subsp. islayensis, commonly known as the Islay cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and salt spray. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system to access water in its arid environment. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found growing in coastal dunes and cliffs."
