    "intro": "Evea muscosa, commonly known as the silky tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has a unique structure with a central axis covered in a dense, silky layer of fine, hair-like fibers. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching, contributing to its lush, fern-like look. Evea muscosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
