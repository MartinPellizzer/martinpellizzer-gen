    "intro": "Eragrostis andicola, commonly known as the Andean lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Eragrostis andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
