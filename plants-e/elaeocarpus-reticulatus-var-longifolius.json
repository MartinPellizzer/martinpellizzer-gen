    "intro": "Elaeocarpus reticulatus var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved elaeocarpus, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
