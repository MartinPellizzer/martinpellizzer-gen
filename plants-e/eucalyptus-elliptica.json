    "intro": "Eucalyptus elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringy gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during spring. Its bark is fibrous and peels away in strips, revealing a smooth, pale inner layer. Eucalyptus elliptica is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
