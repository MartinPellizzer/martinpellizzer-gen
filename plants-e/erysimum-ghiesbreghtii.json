    "intro": "Erysimum ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
