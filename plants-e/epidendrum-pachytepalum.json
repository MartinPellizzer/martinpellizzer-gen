    "intro": "Epidendrum pachytepalum, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Epidendrum pachytepalum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
