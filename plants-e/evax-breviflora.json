    "intro": "Evax breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered evax, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils."
