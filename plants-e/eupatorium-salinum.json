    "intro": "Eupatorium salinum, commonly known as salt marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, and is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eupatorium salinum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
