    "intro": "Elymus condensatus, commonly known as the dense foxtail grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a bluish-gray appearance due to a waxy coating. Elymus condensatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
