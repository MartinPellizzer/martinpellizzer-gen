    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides var. arenisaxosa, commonly known as the sandstone euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
