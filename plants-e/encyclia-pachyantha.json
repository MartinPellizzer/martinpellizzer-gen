It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its seasonal climate. Its leaves are strap-like and grassy, often growing in a rosette pattern. Encyclia pachyantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
