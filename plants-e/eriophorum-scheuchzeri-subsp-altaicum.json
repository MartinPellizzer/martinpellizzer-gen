    "intro": "Eriophorum scheuchzeri subsp. altaicum, commonly known as the alpine tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like stems that form tussocks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
