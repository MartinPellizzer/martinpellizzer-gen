    "intro": "Erysimum apenninum, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. This species typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its bright yellow or orange flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erysimum apenninum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
