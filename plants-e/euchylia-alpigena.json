    "intro": "Euchylia alpigena, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open meadows and scree slopes. Euchylia alpigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
