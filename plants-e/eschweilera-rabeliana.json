    "intro": "Eschweilera rabeliana, commonly known as the Rabelian ceiba, is a species of tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and a tall, straight trunk that can reach heights of up to 50 meters. The tree produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruit that contains a single, hard seed. It plays an important role in the ecosystem as a habitat for various wildlife species. The wood of Eschweilera rabeliana is valued for its strength and durability, though it is not widely commercially exploited."
