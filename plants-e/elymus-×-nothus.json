    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 nothus, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Elymus repens and Elymus triticoides. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, ditches, and along riverbanks, and is often found in the northern hemisphere. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that can stabilize soil. Elymus \u00d7 nothus is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its potential use in forage and erosion control."
