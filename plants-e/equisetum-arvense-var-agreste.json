    "intro": "Equisetum arvense var. agreste, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
