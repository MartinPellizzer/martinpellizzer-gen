    "intro": "Euphorbia alternicolor, commonly known as the zigzag euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias. Euphorbia alternicolor is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
