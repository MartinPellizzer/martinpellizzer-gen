    "intro": "Erica sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically evergreen and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Erica sicula is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
