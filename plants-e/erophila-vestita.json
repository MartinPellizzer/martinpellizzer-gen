    "intro": "Erophila vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Erophila vestita is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
