    "intro": "Empogona cacondensis, commonly known as the Mexican elderberry, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
