    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneata, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, brush-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, which are actually modified stems called cyathia. The plant is a succulent, featuring thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. Euphorbia cuneata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
