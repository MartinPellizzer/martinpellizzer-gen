    "intro": "Echium tenue subsp. dumosum, commonly known as the dwarf thistle or woolly thistle, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and purple to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are often clustered in dense heads, contributing to its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
