    "intro": "Elymus salsuginosus, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. Elymus salsuginosus is adapted to thrive in soils with high salinity and poor nutrients, making it an important component of stabilized dunes and salt marshes. Its resilience and ecological role in preventing soil erosion make it a valuable plant in restoration projects."
