    "intro": "Epidendrum incomptoides, commonly known as the slender epiphytic orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, making it relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
