    "intro": "Elisanthe aprica subsp. daurica, commonly known as Daurian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient plant suitable for rock gardens and dry, well-drained landscapes."
