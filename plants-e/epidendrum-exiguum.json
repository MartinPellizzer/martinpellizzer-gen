    "intro": "Epidendrum exiguum, commonly known as the miniature epidendrum, is a compact bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
