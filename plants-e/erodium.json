    "intro": "Erodium, commonly known as seaside weed or redstem, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It consists of about 150 species, most of which are annual or perennial herbs. The plants typically have small, pink or purple flowers and are often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. They are characterized by their upright growth habit and distinctive seed pods that split open when mature. Erodium species are sometimes considered weeds but are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles."
