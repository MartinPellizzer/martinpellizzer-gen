    "intro": "Euryspermum frondosum, commonly known as the frondose euryspermum, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, yellow-orange ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests."
