    "intro": "Epidendrum vitellinum var. autumnale, commonly known as the Autumn Epidendrum, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating to help retain moisture. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique coloration and seasonal blooming pattern."
