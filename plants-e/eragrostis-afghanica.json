    "intro": "Eragrostis afghanica, commonly known as Afghan lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale-green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Eragrostis afghanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
