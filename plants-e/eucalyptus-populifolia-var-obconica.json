    "intro": "Eucalyptus populifolia var. obconica, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and green. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This variety is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
