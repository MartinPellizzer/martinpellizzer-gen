    "intro": "Euonymus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered woodbine, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Euonymus pauciflorus is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
