    "intro": "Eupatorium sessilifolium var. sessilifolium, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has opposite, sessile leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
