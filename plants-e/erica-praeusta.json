    "intro": "Erica praeusta, commonly known as the Cape heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica praeusta thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
