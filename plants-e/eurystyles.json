    "intro": "Eurystyles, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that resemble those of true orchids. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Eurystyles species have small, ovate leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The flowers usually have three sepals and three petals, with the latter often modified into a specialized lip."
