    "intro": "Erica terminalis f. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
