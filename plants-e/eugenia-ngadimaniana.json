    "intro": "Eugenia ngadimaniana, commonly known as the Ngadimanian myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of New Guinea and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruits are small, dark purple berries that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
