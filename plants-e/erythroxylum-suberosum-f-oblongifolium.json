    "intro": "Erythroxylum suberosum f. oblongifolium, commonly known as the oblong-leaved coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stem and lanceolate, oblong leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is closely related to other coca species and shares similar chemical properties, including the presence of alkaloids. This form is often studied for its botanical and pharmacological significance in traditional and modern contexts."
