    "intro": "Erica cameronii, commonly known as Cameron's heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are evergreen and often covered in a fine, white wax. Erica cameronii is well-suited to rocky or sandy habitats and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to coastal gardens."
