    "intro": "Eremostachys ambigua, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Eremostachys ambigua is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to withstand extreme conditions."
