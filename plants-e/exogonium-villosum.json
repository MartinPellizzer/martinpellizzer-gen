    "intro": "Exogonium villosum, commonly known as the hairy exogonium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple branches and a compact form. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
