    "intro": "Evelyna zamorensis, commonly known as the Moonshade Lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Zamora. It features striking silver-gray foliage with a waxy texture, and its flowers are pale lavender with a subtle iridescence. The plant blooms only under moonlight, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its elusive nature and unique characteristics, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
