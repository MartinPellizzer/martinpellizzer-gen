    "intro": "Euphorbia pilosa var. cognata, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
