    "intro": "Eupatorium monagasense, commonly known as the Cuban boneset, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Eupatorium monagasense is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
