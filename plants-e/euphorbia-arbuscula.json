    "intro": "Euphorbia arbuscula, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem that resembles a small tree, with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a milky sap that can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia arbuscula is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun."
