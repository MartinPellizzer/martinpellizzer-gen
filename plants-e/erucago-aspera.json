It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and has serrated, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is known for its robust and often invasive growth habit.
