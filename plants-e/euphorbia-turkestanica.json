    "intro": "Euphorbia turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkistan spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia. It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a slight pubescence. Euphorbia turkestanica is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
