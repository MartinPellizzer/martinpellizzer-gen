    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 inundatum, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a hybrid plant that combines features of several equisetum species. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the plant, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds and streams."
