    "intro": "Epidendrum obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum obtusifolium is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
