    "intro": "Eriocaulon nilagirense f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh plant, is a grass-like plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. This plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology is adapted to waterlogged soils, with a fibrous root system that aids in anchoring and nutrient absorption. The plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological niche."
