    "intro": "Eugenia bagensis var. avenia, commonly known as the white-flowered eugenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark purple when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
