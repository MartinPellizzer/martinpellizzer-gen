It features alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are hairy and have a peppery aroma. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are contained in slender, cylindrical pods that mature in summer. Eruca eruca is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
