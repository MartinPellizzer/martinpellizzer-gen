    "intro": "Echinopsis longispina, commonly known as the long-spine cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Echinopsis longispina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
