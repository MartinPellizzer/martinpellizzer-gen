    "intro": "Epimeredi candicans, commonly known as the showy bellflower, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the velvety sepals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in the thin, high-altitude air. Epimeredi candicans is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native range."
