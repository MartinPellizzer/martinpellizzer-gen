    "intro": "Euphorbia griffithii var. bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster known as a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant."
