    "intro": "Euphorbia xalapensis var. valida, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its milky sap, which is toxic, can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care."
