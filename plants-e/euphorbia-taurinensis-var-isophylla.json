It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters known as cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
