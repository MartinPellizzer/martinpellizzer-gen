    "intro": "Eriogonum sphaerocephalum var. sericoleucum, commonly known as the silverleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This variety is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
