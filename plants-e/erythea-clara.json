    "intro": "Erythea clara, commonly known as the crimson flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red petals and vibrant orange stamens, which give it its common name. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without being parasitic. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps. Erythea clara is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in traditional medicine in its native regions."
