    "intro": "Erythrococca membranacea, commonly known as the red cocoon plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive red, woolly capsules that encase its seeds. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish, and it produces a unique, fleshy fruit that splits open to release its seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
