    "intro": "Enteropogon rupestris, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Enteropogon rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
