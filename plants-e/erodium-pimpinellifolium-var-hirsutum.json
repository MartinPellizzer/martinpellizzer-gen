    "intro": "Erodium pimpinellifolium var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new areas."
