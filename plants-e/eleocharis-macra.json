    "intro": "Eleocharis macra, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets, which are typically arranged in a compact cluster. The plant grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Eleocharis macra is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas rapidly."
