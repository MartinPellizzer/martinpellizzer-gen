    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 leprophloia, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus microtheca. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, often revealing a mottled appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal and riverine areas, preferring well-drained soils and a temperate climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a grey-green hue and a waxy coating, and it produces small, globular flower clusters. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in marginal environments."
