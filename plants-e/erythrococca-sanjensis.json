    "intro": "Erythrococca sanjensis, commonly known as the Sanjensian red cocoon plant, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, fleshy fruits that encase the seeds, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, shrub-like structure with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is notable for its unique floral morphology. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
