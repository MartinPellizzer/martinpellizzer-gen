    "intro": "Ericoides regerminans, commonly known as the re-emerging heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes plants adapted to acidic soils and nutrient-poor environments. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely arranged along its stems. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Ericoides regerminans is often found in heathlands, moors, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
