    "intro": "Epidendrum megahybos, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in its natural habitat. Epidendrum megahybos prefers bright, indirect light and consistent humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
