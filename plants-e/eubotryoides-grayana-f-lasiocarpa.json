    "intro": "Eubotryoides grayana f. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited form of the Chinese bellflower, is a variant of a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are usually ovate with a hairy texture, and the inflorescence consists of clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The f. lasiocarpa form is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy covering on the fruit and stems, setting it apart from other forms of the species."
