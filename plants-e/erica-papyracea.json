    "intro": "Erica papyracea, commonly known as the paper heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. Erica papyracea is often found in fynbos vegetation, thriving in coastal and mountainous regions."
