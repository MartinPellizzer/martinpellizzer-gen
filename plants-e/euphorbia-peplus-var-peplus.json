    "intro": "Euphorbia peplus var. peplus, commonly known as petty spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant contains latex-like sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
