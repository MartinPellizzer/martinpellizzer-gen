    "intro": "Echinopsis pugionacantha subsp. haemantha, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a columnar cactus with a spiny, ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
