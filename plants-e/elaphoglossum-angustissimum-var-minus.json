    "intro": "Elaphoglossum angustissimum var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It features finely divided, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is characterized by a smooth, glossy texture and a distinctive, fern-like appearance."
