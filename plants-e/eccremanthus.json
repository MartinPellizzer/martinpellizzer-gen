    "intro": "Eccremanthus, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their striking, tubular or funnel-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. Eccremanthus species are typically shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, especially honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright colors."
