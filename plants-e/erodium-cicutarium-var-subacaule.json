It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas readily."
