    "intro": "Eremophila latrobei f. flava, commonly known as the Yellow Ghost Bottlebrush, is a compact shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers, which are tubular and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
