    "intro": "Eclopes glutinosa, commonly known as sticky nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its sticky leaves and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically purple or violet, and it produces berries that contain toxic compounds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both animals and humans."
