    "intro": "Erythrina compacta, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, giving it a fiery appearance. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its compound pods contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant floral display. Erythrina compacta also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
