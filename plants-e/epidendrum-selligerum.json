    "intro": "Epidendrum selligerum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insects. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum selligerum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its cultural significance in the regions where it is found."
