    "intro": "Eucyperus pungens, commonly known as the sword fern, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Eucyperus pungens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
