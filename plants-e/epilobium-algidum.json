    "intro": "Epilobium algidum, commonly known as the alpine willow or cold willow, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in spikes, blooming in late summer. Epilobium algidum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous environments where few other plants can survive."
