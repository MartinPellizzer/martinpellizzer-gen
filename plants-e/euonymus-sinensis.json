It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Euonymus sinensis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes contribute to its aesthetic appeal in gardens and natural habitats."
