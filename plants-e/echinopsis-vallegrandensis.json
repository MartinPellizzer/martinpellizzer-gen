    "intro": "Echinopsis vallegrandensis, commonly known as the Vallegrandensis Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, which are often nocturnal in bloom. It is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
