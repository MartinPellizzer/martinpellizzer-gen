    "intro": "Exostema brachycarpum, commonly known as the broadleaf staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and large, leathery fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
