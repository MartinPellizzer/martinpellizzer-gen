    "intro": "Eleusine gonantha, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it often thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Eleusine gonantha is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental grass due to its delicate appearance and ability to form dense clumps."
