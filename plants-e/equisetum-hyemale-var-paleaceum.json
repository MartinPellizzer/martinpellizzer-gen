    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. paleaceum, commonly known as the pale scottish horsehair. This variant is a member of the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its ancient, primitive structure and lack of true leaves. It features a tall, unbranched stem covered in small, scale-like structures called annular rings. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are typically green and elongated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
