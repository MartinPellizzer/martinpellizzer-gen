    "intro": "Erodium rupestre var. montserratense, commonly known as the Montserrat stickyweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Spain. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
