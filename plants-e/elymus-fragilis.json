    "intro": "Elymus fragilis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves and slender, often sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus fragilis is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
