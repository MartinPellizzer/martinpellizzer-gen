    "intro": "Ekebergia pterophylla, commonly known as the white-flowered sycamore, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Ekebergia pterophylla is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
