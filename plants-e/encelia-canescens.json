    "intro": "Encelia canescens, commonly known as the white globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
