    "intro": "Epipactis leptochila subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the slender helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy yellow-green flower with a distinctive, hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a slender, upright stem and produces a single, erect flower with a short, narrow spur. This subspecies is notable for its relatively small size and subtle floral features compared to other members of the Epipactis genus."
