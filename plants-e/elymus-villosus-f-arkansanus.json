It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are often loosely arranged, with small, awned florets. It thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
