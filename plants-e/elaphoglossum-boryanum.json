    "intro": "Elaphoglossum boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often arching fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum boryanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
