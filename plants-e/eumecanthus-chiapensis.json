    "intro": "Eumecanthus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring, featuring intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for protective measures."
