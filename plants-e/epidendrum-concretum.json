    "intro": "Epidendrum concretum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and is often found growing on rocky substrates. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. Epidendrum concretum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
