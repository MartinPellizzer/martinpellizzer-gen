    "intro": "Eucalyptus gunnii var. acervula, commonly known as the dwarf malleable gum, is a small, spreading shrub native to Tasmania. It features smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to coastal and dry inland environments, and its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. This variety is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resistance to certain pests."
