    "intro": "Euphorbia neopolycnemoides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
