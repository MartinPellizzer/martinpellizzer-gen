    "intro": "Erica cavartica, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Erica cavartica is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
