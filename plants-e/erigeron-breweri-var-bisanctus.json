    "intro": "Erigeron breweri var. bisanctus, commonly known as the Santa Barbara daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southern California. It is characterized by its white to pale blue ray florets and yellow disc florets, which bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it thrives in full sun. It has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves, and it is often found in coastal scrub habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
