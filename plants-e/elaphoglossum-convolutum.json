    "intro": "Elaphoglossum convolutum, commonly known as the twisted holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum convolutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
