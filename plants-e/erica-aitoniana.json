    "intro": "Erica aitoniana, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Erica aitoniana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
