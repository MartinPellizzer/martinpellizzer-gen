    "intro": "Erythronium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid trout lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are often marked with light green veins. The plant produces a single, nodding flower with three petal-like lobes, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully unfurl. Erythronium bifidum thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is a characteristic member of the trillium family."
