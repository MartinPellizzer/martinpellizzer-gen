    "intro": "Edritria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered edritria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
