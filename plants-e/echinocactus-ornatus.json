    "intro": "Echinocactus ornatus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and densely packed, spiny areoles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Echinocactus ornatus is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
