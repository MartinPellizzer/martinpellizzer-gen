    "intro": "Eria longlingensis, commonly known as the Longling orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria longlingensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
