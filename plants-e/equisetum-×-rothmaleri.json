    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 rothmaleri, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It retains the characteristic jointed stems and whorled leaves typical of the Equisetum genus, with a distinctive appearance that resembles its parent species. The plant lacks true flowers and reproduces through spores, a feature common to all horsetails. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its invasive potential in natural habitats."
