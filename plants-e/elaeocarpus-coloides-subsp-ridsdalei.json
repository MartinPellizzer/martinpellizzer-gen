    "intro": "Elaeocarpus coloides subsp. ridsdalei, commonly known as the Christmas tree or red cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey to black bark and its distinctive, clustered inflorescences of small, white flowers. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value, particularly during the Christmas season when its foliage turns a vibrant red. It produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions."
