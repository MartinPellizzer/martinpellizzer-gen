It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, white fruits that split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is named in honor of Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy."
