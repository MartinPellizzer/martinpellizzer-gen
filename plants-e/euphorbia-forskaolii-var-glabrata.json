    "intro": "Euphorbia forskaolii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Africa. It features a cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further adapting to minimize water use. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
