    "intro": "Elaeagnus kologa subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved silverberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
