    "intro": "Eria hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan eria, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Eria hainanensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
