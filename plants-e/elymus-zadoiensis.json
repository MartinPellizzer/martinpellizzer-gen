    "intro": "Elymus zadoiensis, commonly known as the Zadoi's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and long, narrow leaves, which are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, with lemmas that are usually hairy. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Elymus zadoiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
