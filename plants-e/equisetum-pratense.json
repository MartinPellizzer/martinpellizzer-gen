    "intro": "Equisetum pratense, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Equisetum pratense is a primitive vascular plant with a distinctive appearance and ecological significance."
