    "intro": "Euphorbia esula f. octoradiata, commonly known as the Canadian spotted spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are typically green with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
