    "intro": "Eragrostis purshii var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is distinguished by its reduced flowering structure, with fewer flowers compared to other varieties of Eragrostis."
