    "intro": "Eleusine leucosperma, commonly known as white\u9896grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale blue inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is adapted to a wide range of soil types. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss. Eleusine leucosperma is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its delicate appearance and drought tolerance."
