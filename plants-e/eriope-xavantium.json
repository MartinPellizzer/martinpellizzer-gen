    "intro": "Eriope xavantium, commonly known as the silver-leafed eriope, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
