    "intro": "Erica malmesburiensis, commonly known as the Malmesbury heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Erica malmesburiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
