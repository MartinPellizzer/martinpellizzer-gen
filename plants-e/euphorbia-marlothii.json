    "intro": "Euphorbia marlothii, commonly known as the Marloth's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features distinctive, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia marlothii is known for its resilience and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
