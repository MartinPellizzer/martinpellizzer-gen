    "intro": "Epipactis orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its oval, waxy leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent purple spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, usually in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
