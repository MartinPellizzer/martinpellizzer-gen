    "intro": "Epipremnum merrillii, commonly known as the Hawaiian philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Epipremnum merrillii is also known for its rapid growth and ability to climb supports, making it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or trellises."
