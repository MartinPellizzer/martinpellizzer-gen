    "intro": "Euphorbia waldsteinii subsp. jaxartica, commonly known as the Jaxartian spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia. It features a short, thick stem covered in a layer of white, waxy powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
