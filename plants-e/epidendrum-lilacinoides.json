    "intro": "Epidendrum lilacinoides, commonly known as the purple-flowered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Epidendrum lilacinoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
