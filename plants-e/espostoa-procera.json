    "intro": "Espostoa procera, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a striking plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring large, waxy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces bright yellow or orange fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its botanical characteristics include a robust root system and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Espostoa procera is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dramatic appearance and unique flowering habit."
