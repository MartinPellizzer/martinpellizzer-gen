    "intro": "Eremogone koriniana, commonly known as the Korinian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Eremogone koriniana is adapted to drought conditions, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
