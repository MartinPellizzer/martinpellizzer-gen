    "intro": "Elaeocarpus sayeri, commonly known as the Sayer's elaeocarp, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, blue-black berries that are a key feature of the species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
