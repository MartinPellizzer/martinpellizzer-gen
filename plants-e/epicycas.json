    "intro": "Epicycas, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm that belongs to the order Cycadales. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, palm-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Epicycas species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They produce cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to their ancient lineage, they are often referred to as \"living fossils\" because they have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
