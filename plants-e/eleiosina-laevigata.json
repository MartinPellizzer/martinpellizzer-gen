    "intro": "Eleiosina laevigata, commonly known as the smoothleaf eleiosina, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are smooth and elliptical in shape. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, tropical habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
