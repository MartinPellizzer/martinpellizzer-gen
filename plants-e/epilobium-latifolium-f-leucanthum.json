It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy white or pale pink flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. Its botanical interest lies in its distinct floral morphology and its role in supporting pollinators."
