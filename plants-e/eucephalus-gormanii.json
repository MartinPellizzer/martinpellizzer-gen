    "intro": "Eucephalus gormanii, commonly known as Gorman's bluebottle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eucephalus gormanii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
