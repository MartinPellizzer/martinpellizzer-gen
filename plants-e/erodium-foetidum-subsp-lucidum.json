    "intro": "Erodium foetidum subsp. lucidum, commonly known as the glossy bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grassy areas, along paths, and in gardens. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
