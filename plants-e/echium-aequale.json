It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.

Its hairy leaves and spiny calyces are notable botanical features that aid in its survival in arid environments."
