    "intro": "Elettariopsis johorensis, commonly known as the Johore mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within primary rainforests, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it a unique example of epiphytic growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Elettariopsis johorensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
