    "intro": "Erica sessiliflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica sessiliflora is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
