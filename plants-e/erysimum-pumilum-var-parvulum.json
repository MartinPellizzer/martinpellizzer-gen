It features compact, cushion-like foliage composed of small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
