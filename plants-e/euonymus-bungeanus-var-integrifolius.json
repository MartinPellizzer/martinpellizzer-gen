    "intro": "Euonymus bungeanus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leafed woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smooth-margined, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, orbicular\u84b4\u679c that split open to release seeds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and landscape design."
