    "intro": "Euphorbia xanthadenia, commonly known as the yellow adenium, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by unique, bead-like fruits. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia xanthadenia is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is often used in traditional medicine."
