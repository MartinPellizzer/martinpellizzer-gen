    "intro": "Echinops stapfianus, commonly known as the Stapf's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southwestern Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the development of its distinctive bristly fruits. Echinops stapfianus is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert environments. Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions."
