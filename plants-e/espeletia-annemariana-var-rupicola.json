    "intro": "Espeletia annemariana var. rupicola, commonly known as the Andean rock heather, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold, and windy environments. The plant typically has narrow, gray-green leaves covered in a fine layer of white wax, which reduces water loss. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink or purple, and bloom during the warmer months. This variety is adapted to rocky and arid soils, making it a hardy plant found in mountainous areas of Colombia and Ecuador."
