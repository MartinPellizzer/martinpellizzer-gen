    "intro": "Eurya muricata var. huana, commonly known as the Huana waxleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine in some regions for their purported health benefits."
