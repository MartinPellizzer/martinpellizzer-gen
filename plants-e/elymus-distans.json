    "intro": "Elymus distans, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Elymus distans is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
