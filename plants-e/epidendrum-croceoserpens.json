    "intro": "Epidendrum croceoserpens, commonly known as the golden serpent orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, gracefully curved inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers with a distinctive orange-pink lip. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical collections."
