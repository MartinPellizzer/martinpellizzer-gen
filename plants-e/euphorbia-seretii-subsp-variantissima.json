    "intro": "Euphorbia seretii subsp. variantissima, commonly known as the variable euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs."
