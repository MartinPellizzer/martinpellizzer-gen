    "intro": "Euphorbia herniariifolia var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative succulent."
