    "intro": "Eugenia fadyenii, commonly known as the red hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Madagascar, and is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are often overshadowed by the vibrant bracts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy surface. Eugenia fadyenii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its bold, showy appearance."
