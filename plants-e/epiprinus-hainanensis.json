    "intro": "Epiprinus hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan epiprinus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within dense forests, often at elevations between 500 and 1,200 meters. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited ecological and horticultural significance."
