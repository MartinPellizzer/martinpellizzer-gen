    "intro": "Echinopsis pentlandii var. albiflora, commonly known as the Whiteflowered Moon Cactus, is a striking cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
