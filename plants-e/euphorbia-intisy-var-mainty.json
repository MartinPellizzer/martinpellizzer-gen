    "intro": "Euphorbia intisy var. mainty, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a thick, stem-like structure with modified leaves that resemble spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution."
