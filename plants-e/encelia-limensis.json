    "intro": "Encelia limensis, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, resembling those of the sunflower, and blooms during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Encelia limensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in extreme climates."
