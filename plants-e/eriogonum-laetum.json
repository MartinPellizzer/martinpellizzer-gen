    "intro": "Eriogonum laetum, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Eriogonum laetum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil health in arid environments."
