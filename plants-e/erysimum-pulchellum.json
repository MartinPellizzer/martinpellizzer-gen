It features upright, branching stems covered in small, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cruciform flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value. Erysimum pulchellum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower landscapes."
