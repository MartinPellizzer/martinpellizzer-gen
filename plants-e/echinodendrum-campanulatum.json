    "intro": "Echinodendrum campanulatum, commonly known as the bellflower echinodendrum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Echinodendrum campanulatum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
