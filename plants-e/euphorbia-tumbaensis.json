    "intro": "Euphorbia tumbaensis, commonly known as the Tumba spurge, is a succulent plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the high rainfall of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
