    "intro": "Euphorbia balkhanica, commonly known as the Balkhan spurge, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
