    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 schulzei subsp. daissiana, commonly known as the Daissian helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often on limestone soils. It is a perennial herb that produces its flowers in late spring to early summer. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations compared to its parent species."
