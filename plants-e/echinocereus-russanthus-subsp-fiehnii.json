    "intro": "Echinocereus russanthus subsp. fiehnii, commonly known as the Fiehn's prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
