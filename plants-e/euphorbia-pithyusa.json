    "intro": "Euphorbia pithyusa, commonly known as the silver spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems covered in a waxy, silver-gray coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and can be green or reddish depending on light exposure. Euphorbia pithyusa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
