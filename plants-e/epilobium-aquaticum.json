    "intro": "Epilobium aquaticum, commonly known as water thimble, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
