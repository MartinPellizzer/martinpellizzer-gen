    "intro": "Eustegia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bignonia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, white pubescence. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
