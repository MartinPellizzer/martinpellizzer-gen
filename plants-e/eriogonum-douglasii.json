It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its stems are usually hairy. Eriogonum douglasii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
