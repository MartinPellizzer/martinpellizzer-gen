    "intro": "Euphorbia glochidiata, commonly known as the goat's beard or desert hibiscus, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of yellowish-green bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Euphorbia glochidiata is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
