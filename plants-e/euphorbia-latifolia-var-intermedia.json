    "intro": "Euphorbia latifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 (cyathia) that are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
