    "intro": "Epidendrum sumacoense, commonly known as the Sumaco orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil, often found in cloud forests. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
