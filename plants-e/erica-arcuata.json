    "intro": "Erica arcuata, commonly known as the bent heath, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of the United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red. Erica arcuata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy environments."
