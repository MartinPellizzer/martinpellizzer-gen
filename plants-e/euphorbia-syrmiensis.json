    "intro": "Euphorbia syrmiensis, commonly known as the Sirmium spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-shaped inflorescence called a cyathium. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
