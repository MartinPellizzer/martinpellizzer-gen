    "intro": "Encephalartos caffer var. integrifolius, commonly known as the Natal knobbed cycad, is a rare and distinctive cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, segmented trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces a tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears both male and female cones. Its leaves are typically a deep green with a pale midrib, and it is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
