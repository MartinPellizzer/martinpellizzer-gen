    "intro": "Eleocharis flavescens var. fuscescens, commonly known as the dark-stemmed spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its slender, jointed stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize sediment. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland environments."
