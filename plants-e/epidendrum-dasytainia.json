    "intro": "Epidendrum dasytainia, commonly known as the Wooly Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum dasytainia is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
