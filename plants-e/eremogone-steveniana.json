    "intro": "Eremogone steveniana, commonly known as the Steven's eremogone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Eremogone steveniana is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
