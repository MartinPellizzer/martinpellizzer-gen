    "intro": "Euphorbia fructus-pini var. geminata, commonly known as the pine fruit euphorbia, is a rare and unique variant of the euphorbia genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinecone-like fruiting structures that develop from modified stems rather than true flowers. The plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Its foliage consists of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, a feature typical of succulent plants. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
