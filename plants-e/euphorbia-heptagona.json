    "intro": "Euphorbia heptagona, commonly known as the seven-sided spurges, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, seven-sided stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia heptagona is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
