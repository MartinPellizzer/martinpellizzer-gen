    "intro": "Eugenia uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
