    "intro": "Euphorbia plumerioides var. homochroa, commonly known as the variegated euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and may exhibit variegation with white or yellow markings. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. This plant is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
