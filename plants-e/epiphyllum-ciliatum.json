    "intro": "Epiphyllum ciliatum, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a flowering plant that typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its flat, segmented stems and produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to bloom during the holiday season. Epiphyllum ciliatum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
