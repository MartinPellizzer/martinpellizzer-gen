    "intro": "Edraianthus calaminthifolius, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
