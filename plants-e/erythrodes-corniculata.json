    "intro": "Erythrodes corniculata, commonly known as the scarlet bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erythrodes corniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
