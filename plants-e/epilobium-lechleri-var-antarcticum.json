    "intro": "Epilobium lechleri var. antarcticum, commonly known as the Antarctic willow, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of South America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, often pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a low-growing habit that helps it survive in high-altitude and arid regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to extreme conditions."
