    "intro": "Euphorbia quadrangularis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often absent in mature stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia quadrangularis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
