    "intro": "Encelia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky encelia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sticky, resinous leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and desert regions. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. The sticky encelia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
