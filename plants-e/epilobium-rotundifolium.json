    "intro": "Epilobium rotundifolium, commonly known as round-leaf willowherb, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often rounded at the base. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Epilobium rotundifolium is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinators."
