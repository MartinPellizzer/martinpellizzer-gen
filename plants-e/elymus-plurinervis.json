    "intro": "Elymus plurinervis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct vein structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus plurinervis is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
