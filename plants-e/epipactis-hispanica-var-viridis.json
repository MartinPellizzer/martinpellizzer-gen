    "intro": "Epipactis hispanica var. viridis, commonly known as the green Spanish helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats with high humidity and limited light."
