It is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage and small, dark blue berries that appear in winter. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. The berries are edible but are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties."
