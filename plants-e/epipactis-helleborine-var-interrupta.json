    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its reproductive strategy involves the production of small, yellowish-green seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
