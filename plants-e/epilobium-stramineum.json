    "intro": "Epilobium stramineum, commonly known as slender willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist or wet environments such as stream banks and marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed edge. It produces small, pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
