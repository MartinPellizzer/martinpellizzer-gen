    "intro": "Euphorbia emetica, commonly known as the emetic spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia. Its latex contains irritants and toxins, which can cause skin irritation and vomiting if ingested. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments."
