It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically pale green to yellow in color. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin layers, revealing a mottled appearance. Eucalyptus pocillum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and heathlands."
