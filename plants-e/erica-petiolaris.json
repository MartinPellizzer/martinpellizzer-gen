It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Erica petiolaris is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
