    "intro": "Esula exigua, commonly known as the dwarf pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are oval in shape and emit a fragrant scent when crushed. The plant produces small white flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and as a hedging plant."
