    "intro": "Evolvulus chrysotrichos, commonly known as the golden thread vine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a trailing or climbing herb that produces small, showy yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
