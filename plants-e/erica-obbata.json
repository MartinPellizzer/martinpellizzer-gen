    "intro": "Erica obbata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica obbata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
