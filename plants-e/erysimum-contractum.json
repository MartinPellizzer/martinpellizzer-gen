    "intro": "Erysimum contractum, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of only 10 to 20 centimeters and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compact, fuzzy leaves and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arid environments. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a short growth cycle to avoid summer heat. Erysimum contractum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in difficult soil conditions."
