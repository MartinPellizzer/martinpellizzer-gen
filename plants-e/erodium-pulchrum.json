    "intro": "Erodium pulchrum, commonly known as the pretty bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erodium pulchrum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
