    "intro": "Eryngium minimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, surrounded by a series of bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has silver-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, enhancing its drought tolerance. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it adaptable to sandy or rocky soils. Eryngium minimum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking visual appeal and hardy nature."
