    "intro": "Eriosyce odieri, commonly known as the Opuntia-like cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems, adapting to arid environments. Eriosyce odieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
