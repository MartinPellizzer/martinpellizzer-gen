    "intro": "Euphorbia cuneata subsp. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, spiny stems. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Due to its spines and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh, dry climates."
