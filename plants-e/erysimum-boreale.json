    "intro": "Erysimum boreale, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Erysimum boreale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to rock gardens and alpine settings."
