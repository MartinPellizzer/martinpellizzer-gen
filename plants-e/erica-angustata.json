It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in sunny, coastal environments. Erica angustata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing shrubs. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
