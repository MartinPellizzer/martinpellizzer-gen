    "intro": "Eria vestita, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a short, stocky rhizome and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent. The plant's leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth. Eria vestita is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
