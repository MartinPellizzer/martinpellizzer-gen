    "intro": "Ericoides flaccum, commonly known as the flame heather, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and densely packed, providing a dense cover that helps retain moisture in its rocky, well-drained habitats. Ericoides flaccum is well adapted to acidic soils and is often found in high-altitude environments where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
