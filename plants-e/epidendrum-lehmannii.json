It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.
