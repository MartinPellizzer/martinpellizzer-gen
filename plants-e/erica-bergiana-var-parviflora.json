    "intro": "Erica bergiana var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are dense and form a low, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This hardy plant is well suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and resilience to coastal conditions."
