    "intro": "Eritrichium texanum, commonly known as Texas mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that typically reaches heights of 2 to 6 inches. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
