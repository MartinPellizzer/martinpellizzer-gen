    "intro": "Enteropogon somalensis, commonly known as the Somali false oat, is a grass species native to the arid regions of Somalia and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is notable for its resilience in semi-arid climates."
