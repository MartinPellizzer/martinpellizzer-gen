    "intro": "Epidendrum yumboense, commonly known as the Yumbo Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Colombia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and white. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Epidendrum yumboense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
