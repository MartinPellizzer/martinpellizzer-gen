This plant is a perennial herbaceous species that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and the presence of whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typical of the Equisetum genus. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botany and ecology."
