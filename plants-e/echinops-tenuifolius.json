    "intro": "Echinops tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a key feature in its common name. The plant has silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces blue or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops tenuifolius is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
