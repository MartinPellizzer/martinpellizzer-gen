    "intro": "Epigeneium simplex, commonly known as the slender epigeneium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and possesses a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the variety. Epigeneium simplex thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
