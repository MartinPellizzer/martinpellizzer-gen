It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. This subspecies is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
