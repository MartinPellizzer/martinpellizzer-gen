    "intro": "Elionurus citreus, commonly known as the citreous elionurus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Elionurus citreus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
