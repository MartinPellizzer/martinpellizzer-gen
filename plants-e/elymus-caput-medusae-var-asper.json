    "intro": "Elymus caput-medusae var. asper, commonly known as the rough-headed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a crown, giving it its Latin name. The leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
