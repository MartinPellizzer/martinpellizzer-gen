    "intro": "Epilobium gunnianum, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and rocky outcrops. Epilobium gunnianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
