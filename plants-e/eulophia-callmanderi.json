    "intro": "Eulophia callmanderi, commonly known as the Callmander\u2019s eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem that bears several showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Eulophia callmanderi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
