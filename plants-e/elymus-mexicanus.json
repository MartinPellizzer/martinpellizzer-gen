    "intro": "Elymus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid environments. Elymus mexicanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its flowering heads are spike-like and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds."
