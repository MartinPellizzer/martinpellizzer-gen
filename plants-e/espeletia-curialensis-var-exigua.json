It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth pattern. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the dry season, which are clustered in a compact inflorescence. This variety is notable for its compact size and is often found in rocky or open habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters."
