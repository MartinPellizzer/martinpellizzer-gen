    "intro": "Eriogonum demissum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum demissum is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
