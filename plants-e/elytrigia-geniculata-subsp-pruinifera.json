    "intro": "Elytrigia geniculata subsp. pruinifera, commonly known as the pruinose bentgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
