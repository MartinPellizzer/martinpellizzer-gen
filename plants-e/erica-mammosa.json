    "intro": "Erica mammosa, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features needle-like leaves covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica mammosa produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in Mediterranean-type climates."
