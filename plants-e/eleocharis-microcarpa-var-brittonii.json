The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with standing water or saturated soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast region."
