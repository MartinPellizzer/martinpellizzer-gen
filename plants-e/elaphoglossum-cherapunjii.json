    "intro": "Elaphoglossum cherapunjii, commonly known as the Bhutanese water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum cherapunjii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
