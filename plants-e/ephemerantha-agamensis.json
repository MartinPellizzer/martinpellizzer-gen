    "intro": "Ephemerantha agamensis, commonly known as the Agam's ephemeral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, ephemeral blooms that appear briefly during the monsoon season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
