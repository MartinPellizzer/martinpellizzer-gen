    "intro": "Eugenia americana, commonly known as the American beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright purple berries in the fall, which are a key feature for its ornamental value. These berries are not typically consumed by humans but are a food source for various birds and wildlife. Eugenia americana thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in native plant gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
