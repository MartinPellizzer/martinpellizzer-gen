    "intro": "Euphorbia viridis, commonly known as the Green Spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a distinctive rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
