    "intro": "Epidendrum fusiforme, commonly known as the spindle-shaped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces pendulous flower spikes with numerous small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
