    "intro": "Erythrina breviflora f. petraea, commonly known as the rock erythrina, is a variant of the coral tree characterized by its compact growth habit and adaptation to rocky environments. It features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its striking red flowers are clustered in racemes, adding vibrant color to its habitat. The plant produces pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to regions of southern Africa and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. This form is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in arid or semi-arid conditions."
