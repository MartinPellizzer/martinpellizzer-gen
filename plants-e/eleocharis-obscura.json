    "intro": "Eleocharis obscura, commonly known as black needlegrass, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to the ecological health of wetland habitats. Eleocharis obscura is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
