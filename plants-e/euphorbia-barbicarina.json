    "intro": "Euphorbia barbicarina, commonly known as the barbed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
