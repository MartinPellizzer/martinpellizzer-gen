    "intro": "Erica trichostigma, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Erica trichostigma is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its foliage is needle-like and evergreen, providing ornamental value throughout the year."
