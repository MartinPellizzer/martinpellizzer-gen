    "intro": "Euphorbia herteri, commonly known as the Herter's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features succulent, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
