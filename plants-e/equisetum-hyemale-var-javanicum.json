    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. javanicum, commonly known as the Javanese horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a distinctive, jointed stem that is covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, typical of the Equisetaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
