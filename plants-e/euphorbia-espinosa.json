    "intro": "Euphorbia espinosa, commonly known as the Spanish buttercup, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Euphorbia espinosa is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
