    "intro": "Eleocharis trilateralis, commonly known as the three-angled sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. Eleocharis trilateralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
