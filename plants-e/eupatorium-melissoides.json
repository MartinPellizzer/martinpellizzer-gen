    "intro": "Eupatorium melissoides, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers that resemble mist, giving it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Eupatorium melissoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
