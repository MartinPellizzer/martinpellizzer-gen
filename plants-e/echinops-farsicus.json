    "intro": "Echinops farsicus, commonly known as Persian thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the distinctive bristly seed heads. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions. Echinops farsicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
