    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 mixtum, commonly known as the hybrid willow herb, is a perennial plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Epilobium angustifolium (narrow-leaved willow herb) and Epilobium palustre (marsh willow herb). The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. It features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clustered racemes. Epilobium \u00d7 mixtum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
