    "intro": "Eleogiton litoralis, commonly known as the coastal eleogiton, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the shoreline. Due to its unique habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
