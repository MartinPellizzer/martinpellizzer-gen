    "intro": "Encyclia capartiana, commonly known as the Capartian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native high-altitude environment. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a greenish-yellow color and red streaks, typically blooming in late summer. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
