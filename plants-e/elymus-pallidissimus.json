    "intro": "Elymus pallidissimus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Elymus pallidissimus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
