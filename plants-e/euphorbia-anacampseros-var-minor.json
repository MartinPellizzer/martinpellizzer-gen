It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces unique, clustered inflorescences known as cyathia, which are typically yellow with red bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is popular among succulent enthusiasts."
