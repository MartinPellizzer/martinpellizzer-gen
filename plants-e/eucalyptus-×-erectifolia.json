It is characterized by its slender, erect habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its bark is fibrous and peels in long, narrow strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
