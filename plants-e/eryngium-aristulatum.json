    "intro": "Eryngium aristulatum, commonly known as the prairie eryngium, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistle, with bracts that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Eryngium aristulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
