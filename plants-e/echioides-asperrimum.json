    "intro": "Echioides asperrimum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its rough texture. Echioides asperrimum is often found in grasslands and wastelands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
