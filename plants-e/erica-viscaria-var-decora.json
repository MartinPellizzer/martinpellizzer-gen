    "intro": "Erica viscaria var. decora, commonly known as the Decorated Heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Erica viscaria var. decora is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
