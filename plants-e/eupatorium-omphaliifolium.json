    "intro": "Eupatorium omphaliifolium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and showy, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Its leaves are typically lobed or divided, and the plant has a compact, upright growth habit. Eupatorium omphaliifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
