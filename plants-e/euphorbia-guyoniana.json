    "intro": "Euphorbia guyoniana, commonly known as the Guyon's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
