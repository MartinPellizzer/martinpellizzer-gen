    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hispaniolicum, commonly known as the Spanish rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 20 cm in length. The plant has a rosette-like growth habit, with leaves arranged in a tight circle around the central stem. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils."
