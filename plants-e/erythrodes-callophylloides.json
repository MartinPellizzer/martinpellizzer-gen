    "intro": "Erythrodes callophylloides, commonly known as the red-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage and pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
