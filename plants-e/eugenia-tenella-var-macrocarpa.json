    "intro": "Eugenia tenella var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited velvetwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible, purple-black fruits that are rich in antioxidants and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. The varietal distinction, macrocarpa, refers to its larger fruit size compared to the typical variety."
