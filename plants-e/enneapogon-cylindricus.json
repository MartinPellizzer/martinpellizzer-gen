    "intro": "Enneapogon cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Enneapogon cylindricus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support native wildlife."
