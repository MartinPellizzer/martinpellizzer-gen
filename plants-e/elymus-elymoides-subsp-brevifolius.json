    "intro": "Elymus elymoides subsp. brevifolius, commonly known as the shortleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Elymus elymoides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
