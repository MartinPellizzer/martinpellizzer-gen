    "intro": "Eryngium pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistle flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eryngium pohlianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
