    "intro": "Epipactis latifolia var. decipiens, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, humusy soils. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike and have a unique structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, aiding in pollination. This orchid is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil."
