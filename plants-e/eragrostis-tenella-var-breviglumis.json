    "intro": "Eragrostis tenella var. breviglumis, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of North America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often concealed within the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its compact form and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
