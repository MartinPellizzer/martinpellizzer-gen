    "intro": "Elettaria major, commonly known as cardamom, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of India, Sri Lanka, and other parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, finger-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces highly fragrant, dark brown seeds enclosed in three pod-like capsules, which are the primary commercial product. Cardamom thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained, fertile soil. It is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
