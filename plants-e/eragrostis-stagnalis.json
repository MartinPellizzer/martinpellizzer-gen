    "intro": "Eragrostis stagnalis, commonly known as swamp ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
