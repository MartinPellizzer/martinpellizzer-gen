    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium var. maculatum, commonly known as the spotted bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine hairs. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
