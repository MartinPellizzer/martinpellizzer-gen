    "intro": "Eucalyptus rhodantha var. petiolaris, commonly known as the red gum or red box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, revealing a reddish-brown color underneath. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and can vary in color from pale green to a striking red or purple during certain times of the year. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale yellow or cream, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
