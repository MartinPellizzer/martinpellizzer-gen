It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Ecbolium laevilingue is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
