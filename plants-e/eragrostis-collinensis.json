    "intro": "Eragrostis collinensis, commonly known as hillside lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted culms with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Eragrostis collinensis is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
