    "intro": "Empodium monophyllum, commonly known as the single-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, solitary, and thickly succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
