    "intro": "Elaphoglossum preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum preussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
