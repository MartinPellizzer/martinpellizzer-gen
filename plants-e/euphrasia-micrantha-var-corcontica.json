    "intro": "Euphrasia micrantha var. corcontica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it is known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies.
