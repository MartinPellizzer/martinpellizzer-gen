    "intro": "Erodium cicutarium f. pimpinellifolium, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, funnel-shaped flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful cover plant and a potential weed."
