    "intro": "Echinocereus durangensis var. rufispinus, commonly known as the red-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are reddish in color, which is a distinguishing feature of this variety. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
