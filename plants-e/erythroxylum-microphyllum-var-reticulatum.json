It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elliptical, hairy buds. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. The leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which have been historically used in traditional Andean medicine and rituals."
