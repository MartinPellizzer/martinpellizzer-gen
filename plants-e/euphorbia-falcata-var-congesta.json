    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that are often tinged with red, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that help store water. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is known for its drought tolerance. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
