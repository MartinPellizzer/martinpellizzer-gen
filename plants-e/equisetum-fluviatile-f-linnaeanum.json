    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile f. linnaeanum, commonly known as the Linnaean water horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in wet, muddy environments. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the water's edge. Its leaves are reduced to tiny, scale-like projections, and it lacks true leaves. This fern-like plant is often found in shallow water or damp soil, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
