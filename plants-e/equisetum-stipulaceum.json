    "intro": "Equisetum stipulaceum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the genus Equisetum. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures called annular rings. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. Equisetum stipulaceum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
