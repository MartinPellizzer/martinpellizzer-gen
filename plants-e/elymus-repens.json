    "intro": "Elymus repens, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow, bluish-green, and often have a rough texture. Elymus repens is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
