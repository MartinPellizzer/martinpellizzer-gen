    "intro": "Euxenia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features succulent, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to add texture to dry garden environments."
