    "intro": "Elaphoglossum glabricaule, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, glabrous (smooth) stems and delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. This plant is native to the temperate regions of the southern United States, particularly in the southeastern states. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Elaphoglossum glabricaule is often found growing in clusters, with its rhizomatous growth habit allowing it to spread slowly over time."
