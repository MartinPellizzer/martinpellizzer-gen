    "intro": "Euphorbia pampeana, commonly known as the Pampas spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Pampas region of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia pampeana is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
