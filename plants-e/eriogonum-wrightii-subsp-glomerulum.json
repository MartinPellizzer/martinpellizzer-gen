    "intro": "Eriogonum wrightii subsp. glomerulum, commonly known as Wright's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and chaparral areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in native plant restoration projects."
