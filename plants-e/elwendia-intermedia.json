    "intro": "Elwendia intermedia, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often more showy than the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a rough texture. Elwendia intermedia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
