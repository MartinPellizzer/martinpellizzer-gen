    "intro": "Epilobium parviflorum f. trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved willow herb, is a variant of the willow herb species characterized by its trifoliate leaves. It is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, woodland or streamside habitats. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which distinguishes it from the typical two-leaflet form of the species. This botanical feature contributes to its ecological role as a food source for various insects and wildlife."
