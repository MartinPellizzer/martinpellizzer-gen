    "intro": "Equisetum pratense f. ramulosum, commonly known as the tufted field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, segmented stem. This variety is distinguished by its dense, tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant is a relic from the Paleozoic era and exhibits primitive features such as spore reproduction."
