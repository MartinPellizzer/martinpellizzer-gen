    "intro": "Elettariopsis elan, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
