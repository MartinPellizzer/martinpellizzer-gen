    "intro": "Echithes, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, fibrous stem and produces small, pale green flowers that bloom at night. Echithes thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its harsh environment. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
