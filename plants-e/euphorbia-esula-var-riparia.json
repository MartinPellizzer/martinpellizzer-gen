    "intro": "Euphorbia esula var. riparia, commonly known as Canadian spotted spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, green stems that are often dotted with yellowish or greenish glands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in open areas such as roadsides, meadows, and waste grounds. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
