    "intro": "Epibaterium, commonly known as the epiphytic liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the surfaces of trees, rocks, or other substrates. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. Epibaterium reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Its simple structure and ability to grow on various surfaces make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions."
