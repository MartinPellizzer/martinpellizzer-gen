    "intro": "Encyclia truncata, commonly known as the truncated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, and its leaves are narrow and arranged in two ranks. Encyclia truncata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
