    "intro": "Epilobium quadrangulum, commonly known as the four-cornered willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped with toothed margins. The flowers are small, pink to purple, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
