    "intro": "Eremophila viscimarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Eremophila viscimarginata is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
