    "intro": "Euphorbia lamarckii var. despoliata, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features a short, thick stem with spiny, fleshy leaves that help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
