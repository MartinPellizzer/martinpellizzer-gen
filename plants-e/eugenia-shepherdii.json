    "intro": "Eugenia shepherdii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it conserve water in dry conditions. Eugenia shepherdii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, low-water landscapes."
