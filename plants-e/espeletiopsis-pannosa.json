    "intro": "Espeletiopsis pannosa, commonly known as the pannose espeletiopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Espeletiopsis pannosa is considered a species of conservation concern."
