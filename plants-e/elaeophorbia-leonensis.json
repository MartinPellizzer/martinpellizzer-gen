    "intro": "Elaeophorbia leonensis, commonly known as the Leonese aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
