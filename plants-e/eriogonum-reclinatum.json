    "intro": "Eriogonum reclinatum, commonly known as the bentleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and gray-green foliage, with leaves that often curve downward. The plant produces small, clustered white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Eriogonum reclinatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush habitats."
