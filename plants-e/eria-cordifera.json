    "intro": "Eria cordifera, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Eria cordifera is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
