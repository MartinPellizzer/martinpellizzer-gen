The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This orchid prefers warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
