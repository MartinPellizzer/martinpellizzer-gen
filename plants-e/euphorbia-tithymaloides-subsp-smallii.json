    "intro": "Euphorbia tithymaloides subsp. smallii, commonly known as the Cape Honeysuckle, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces showy, clustered yellow flowers with red bracts. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, typical of arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. However, it can be invasive in some regions and should be planted with caution."
