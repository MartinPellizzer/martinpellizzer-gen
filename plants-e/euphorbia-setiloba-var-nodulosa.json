    "intro": "Euphorbia setiloba var. nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with swollen, knobby nodes that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced or absent, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic organ. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
