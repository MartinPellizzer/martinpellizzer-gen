    "intro": "Equisetum hybridum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late spring or early summer. Equisetum hybridum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Its ancient lineage dates back over 300 million years, making it one of the oldest living plant groups."
