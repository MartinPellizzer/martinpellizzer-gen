    "intro": "Eryngium luzulifolium var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved eryngium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and distinctive, spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a crown. The plant's leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
