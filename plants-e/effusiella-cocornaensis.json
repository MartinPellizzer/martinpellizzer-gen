    "intro": "Effusiella cocornaensis, commonly known as the Cocora fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in moist, shaded areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by spore-bearing structures, which are essential for its reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Effusiella cocornaensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
