    "intro": "Euphorbia belagaviensis, commonly known as the Belagavi spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Indian state of Karnataka. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
