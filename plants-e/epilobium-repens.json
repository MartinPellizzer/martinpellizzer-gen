    "intro": "Epilobium repens, commonly known as trailing willow herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, disturbed soils. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs and often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Epilobium repens is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used in traditional herbal remedies."
