    "intro": "Euphorbia alata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a thick, branching stem covered with spiny, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by unique, bead-like structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Euphorbia alata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and resilience."
