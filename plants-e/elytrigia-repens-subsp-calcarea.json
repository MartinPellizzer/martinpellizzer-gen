    "intro": "Elytrigia repens subsp. calcarea, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
