It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender stems and narrow, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
