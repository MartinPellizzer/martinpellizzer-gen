    "intro": "Epidendrum calyptrandrium, commonly known as the Calyptrandrium Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
