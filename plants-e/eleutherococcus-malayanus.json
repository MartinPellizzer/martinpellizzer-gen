It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The berries are edible but are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans."
