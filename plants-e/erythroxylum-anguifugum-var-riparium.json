    "intro": "Erythroxylum anguifugum var. riparium, commonly known as the river holly, is a flowering plant species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments near rivers and streams, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
