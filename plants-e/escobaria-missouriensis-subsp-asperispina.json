    "intro": "Escobaria missouriensis subsp. asperispina, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the central United States. It features a dense cluster of spiny, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
