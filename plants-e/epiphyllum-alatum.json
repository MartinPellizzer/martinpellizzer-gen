    "intro": "Epiphyllum alatum, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are actually modified stems called phyllodes. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically open at night, hence its common name. These flowers can be white, pink, or red, and they emit a fragrant scent. Epiphyllum alatum is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
