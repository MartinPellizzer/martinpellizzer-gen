    "intro": "Elytranthe leucantha, commonly known as the white leaved elytranthe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive white or pale green foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Elytranthe leucantha thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
