    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf holly fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in association with other epiphytic or lithophytic plants."
