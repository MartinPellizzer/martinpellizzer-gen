    "intro": "Elaphoglossum firmulum, commonly known as the firm fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover known as a indusium. Elaphoglossum firmulum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
