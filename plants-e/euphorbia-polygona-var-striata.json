    "intro": "Euphorbia polygona var. striata, commonly known as the striped spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem covered in spiny, oval-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinct stripes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
