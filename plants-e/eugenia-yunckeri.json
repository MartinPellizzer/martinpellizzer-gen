    "intro": "Eugenia yunckeri, commonly known as the Yunque or Yunque myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Eugenia yunckeri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its ornamental value and unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural and ecological studies."
