It features a short, thick stem with four prominent, branching spines at the top, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to store water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique morphology, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and collections."
