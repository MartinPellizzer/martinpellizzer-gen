    "intro": "Erica glandulosa var. breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves and produces dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant is well adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
