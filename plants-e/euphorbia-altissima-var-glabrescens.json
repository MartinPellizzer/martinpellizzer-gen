It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
