    "intro": "Echeveria parva, commonly known as the miniature echeveria, is a small, compact succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container plantings."
