    "intro": "Erica vestitoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid native habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in clusters and blooming in late winter to early spring. Erica vestitoides is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its tolerance of poor, acidic soils and full sun exposure."
