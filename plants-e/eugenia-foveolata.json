    "intro": "Eugenia foveolata, commonly known as the black myrtle, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, black, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and used in traditional medicine. Eugenia foveolata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
