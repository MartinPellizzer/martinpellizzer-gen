    "intro": "Elephas, commonly known as the African forest elephant, is a large herbivorous mammal native to the dense rainforests of Central and West Africa. While not a plant, Elephas is often confused with the genus *Elephantopus*, which includes several flowering plants in the daisy family. These plants typically have hairy stems and produce small, daisy-like flowers. They are often found in moist, shaded environments and are known for their medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices. The genus *Elephantopus* is characterized by its unique leaf structures and adaptability to various soil types."
