    "intro": "Elaeagnus nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko's silverleaf, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves, which are covered in dense, fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, nut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or along stream banks. Elaeagnus nikoensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
