This feature is a modified stem that serves both a structural and reproductive role. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are small and succulent, enabling it to conserve water efficiently. The flower is simple and unisexual, contributing to its ecological significance in pollination and seed dispersal."
