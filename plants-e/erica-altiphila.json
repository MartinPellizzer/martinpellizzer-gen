    "intro": "Erica altiphila, commonly known as the alpine heath, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Erica altiphila typically grows in mountainous areas, often in open grasslands or on rocky slopes. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
