    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 graberi, commonly known as the hybrid marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Epipactis \u00d7 graberi is a natural hybrid between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in some regions."
