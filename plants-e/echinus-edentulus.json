    "intro": "Echinus edentulus, commonly known as the sea urchin, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the class Echinoidea. It is characterized by its spherical body covered in movable spines, which serve as both a defense mechanism and a means of locomotion. The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its name, though it is not a true plant but an echinoderm. Its skeletal structure is made of calcium carbonate, forming a rigid, spiky shell. Echinus edentulus plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by grazing on algae and contributing to the balance of reef environments."
