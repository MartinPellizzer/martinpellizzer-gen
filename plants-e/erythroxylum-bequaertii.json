    "intro": "Erythroxylum bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, round berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
