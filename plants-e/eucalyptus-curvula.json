    "intro": "Eucalyptus curvula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrubs and narrow, leathery leaves. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, arranged in clusters. Eucalyptus curvula is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
