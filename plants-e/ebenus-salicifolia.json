    "intro": "Ebenus salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths, contributing to its ecological significance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its historical use in traditional medicine."
