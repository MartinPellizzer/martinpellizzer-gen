    "intro": "Elymus arenarius var. scabrinervis, commonly known as the sandgrass or sandrye, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough, scabrous texture along the nerves, giving it its specific epithet \"scabrinervis.\" It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
