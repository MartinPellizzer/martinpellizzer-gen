    "intro": "Echinochloa quadrifaria var. atroviolacea, commonly known as blackseed grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, dark-colored seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
