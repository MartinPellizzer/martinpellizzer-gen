    "intro": "Echinocereus acifer, commonly known as the golden cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny clusters of modified leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically tubular in shape. Echinocereus acifer is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
