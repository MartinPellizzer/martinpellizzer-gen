It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with glandular dots. The plant produces small, clustered white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The glandular hairs on its leaves and stems are a distinguishing botanical feature."
