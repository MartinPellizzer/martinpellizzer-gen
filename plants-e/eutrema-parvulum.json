    "intro": "Eutrema parvulum, commonly known as the dwarf sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent aroma. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a basal rosette structure that helps it conserve moisture. Eutrema parvulum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
