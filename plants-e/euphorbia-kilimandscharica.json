    "intro": "Euphorbia kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its stems for survival. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
