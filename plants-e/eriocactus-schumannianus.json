    "intro": "Eriocactus schumannianus, commonly known as the Schumann's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a spineless cactus with a cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 feet tall. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
