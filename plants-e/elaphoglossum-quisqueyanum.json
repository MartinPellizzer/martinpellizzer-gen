    "intro": "Elaphoglossum quisqueyanum, commonly known as the Quechua holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Elaphoglossum quisqueyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
