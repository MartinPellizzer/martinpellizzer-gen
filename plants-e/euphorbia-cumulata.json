    "intro": "Euphorbia cumulata, commonly known as the cushion euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure composed of fleshy, cylindrical stems that form a compact cushion-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, water-storing stems help it survive in arid environments, making it well adapted to rocky and dry habitats. Euphorbia cumulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and resilience."
