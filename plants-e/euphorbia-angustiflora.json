    "intro": "Euphorbia angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions. Due to its toxic milky sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation or study."
