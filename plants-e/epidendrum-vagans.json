    "intro": "Epidendrum vagans, commonly known as the wandering orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive periods of drought. Epidendrum vagans is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
