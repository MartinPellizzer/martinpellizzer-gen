    "intro": "Euonymus lacerus, commonly known as the roughleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Euonymus lacerus is relatively low-maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases."
