    "intro": "Enrila dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous grass, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a dichotomous pattern, branching at right angles. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Enrila dichotoma plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
