    "intro": "Eucalyptus subangusta subsp. virescens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The flowers are typically white or cream and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water uptake. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat in its native range."
