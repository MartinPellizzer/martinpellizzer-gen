    "intro": "Erica adenophora, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, acidic conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Erica adenophora is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in native landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
