    "intro": "Euphorbia radioloides, commonly known as the radiate spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a distinctive crown of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its water-storing leaves and reduced leaf surfaces. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a natural defense against herbivores. Euphorbia radioloides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
