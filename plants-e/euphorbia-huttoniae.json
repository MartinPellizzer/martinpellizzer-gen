    "intro": "Euphorbia huttoniae, commonly known as the Hutton's spurge, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens. However, it contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it."
