    "intro": "Euphorbia fuhsii, commonly known as the Fuhs' spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia fuhsii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
