    "intro": "Euphorbia bilocularis, commonly known as the two-chambered spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, fleshy stem with small, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces unique yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stem and leaves. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
