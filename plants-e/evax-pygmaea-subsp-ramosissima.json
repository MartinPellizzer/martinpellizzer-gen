    "intro": "Evax pygmaea subsp. ramosissima, commonly known as the slender dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, branched growth pattern, which gives it the subspecific name \"ramosissima.\" The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, and it often forms colonies on tree bark or rock surfaces. It lacks distinct lobes and has a uniform, compact structure. This subspecies is commonly found in temperate forests and is an indicator of clean, humid air due to its sensitivity to pollution."
