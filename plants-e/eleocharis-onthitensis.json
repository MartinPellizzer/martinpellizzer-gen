    "intro": "Eleocharis onthitensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Eleocharis onthitensis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity."
