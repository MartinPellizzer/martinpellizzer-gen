It features small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded garden areas."
