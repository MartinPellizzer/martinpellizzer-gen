It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, often blooming in late summer. Elleanthus bradeorum is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
