    "intro": "Epilobium conspersum, commonly known as sticky willow or woolly willow, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, often wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features slender, woody stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in a glandular, sticky coating. The flowers are small, pink to reddish, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland landscapes."
