    "intro": "Eryngium humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble a crown, surrounded by bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eryngium humboldtii is often found in coastal and inland desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects."
