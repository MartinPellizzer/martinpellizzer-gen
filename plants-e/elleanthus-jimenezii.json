    "intro": "Elleanthus jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's elleanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, spreading growth habit with narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elleanthus jimenezii is considered a species of conservation concern."
