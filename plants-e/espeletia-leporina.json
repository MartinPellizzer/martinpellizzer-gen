    "intro": "Espeletia leporina, commonly known as the \"rabbit's ear\" plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white composite flowers that bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Espeletia leporina thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
