    "intro": "Ephippium capitatum, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and bright yellow spore cases, known as ephippia, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are short and clustered, with a dense arrangement of sporangia that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Ephippium capitatum is valued in horticulture for its vibrant color and unique appearance."
