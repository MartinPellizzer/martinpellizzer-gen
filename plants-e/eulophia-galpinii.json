It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape at the base of the plant. Eulophia galpinii thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
