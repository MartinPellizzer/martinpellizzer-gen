    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile subsp. limosum, commonly known as the swamp or marsh horsetail, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. This subspecies thrives in wet, marshy environments, often found along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. The plant is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in wetlands."
