    "intro": "Eucalyptus macrorhyncha subsp. cannonii, commonly known as the Cape York gum, is a tall, slender eucalyptus species native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It produces woody capsules containing viable seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in open forests or woodlands."
