    "intro": "Evax micropodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features compact, succulent-like stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Evax micropodioides is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
