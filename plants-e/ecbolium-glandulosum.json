    "intro": "Ecbolium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant's leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, while its stems are often branched and covered in glandular hairs. The sticky secretions on its bladders aid in capturing prey, contributing to its role as a carnivorous plant. Its distribution is primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor habitats."
