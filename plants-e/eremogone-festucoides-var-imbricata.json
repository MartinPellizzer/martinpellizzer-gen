    "intro": "Eremogone festucoides var. imbricata, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important component of stabilized soils in desert and steppe ecosystems."
