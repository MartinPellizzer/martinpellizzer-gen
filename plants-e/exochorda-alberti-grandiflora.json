    "intro": "Exochorda alberti grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered snowball bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features showy, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its winter interest comes from its attractive, reddish-brown bark."
