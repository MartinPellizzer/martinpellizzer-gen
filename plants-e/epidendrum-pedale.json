    "intro": "Epidendrum pedale, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Epidendrum pedale thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil."
