    "intro": "Euphorbia crossadenia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap, which is a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Euphorbia crossadenia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
