    "intro": "Echinus dallachyanus, commonly known as the Dallachyan sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a layer of mucus. The plant, or more accurately the animal, has a distinctive, spiky appearance due to the presence of short, tuberculate projections along its body. It is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and other marine plants. Echinus dallachyanus plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the grazing pressure on algal communities."
