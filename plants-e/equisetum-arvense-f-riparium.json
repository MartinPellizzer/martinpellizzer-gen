    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. riparium, commonly known as water horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This fern is typically found in moist, wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and roadside ditches. It thrives in nutrient-rich soils and is often an indicator of waterlogged conditions. The plant reproduces via spores and is considered a primitive vascular plant with ancient evolutionary origins."
