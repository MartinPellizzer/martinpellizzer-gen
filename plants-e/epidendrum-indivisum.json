    "intro": "Epidendrum indivisum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Epidendrum indivisum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
