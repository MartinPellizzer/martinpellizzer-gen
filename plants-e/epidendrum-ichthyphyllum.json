    "intro": "Epidendrum ichthyphyllum, commonly known as the fish-scale epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are covered in small, scale-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum ichthyphyllum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
