    "intro": "Elephantopus riedelii, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Elephantopus riedelii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
