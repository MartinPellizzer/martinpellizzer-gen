    "intro": "Epidendrum klueppelianum, commonly known as the Klueppel's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its foliage is broad and leathery, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
