It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
