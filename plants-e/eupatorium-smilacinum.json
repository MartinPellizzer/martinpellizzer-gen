    "intro": "Eupatorium smilacinum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium smilacinum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
