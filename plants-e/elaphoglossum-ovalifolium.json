    "intro": "Elaphoglossum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, upright rosette. The plant features small, spore-producing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
