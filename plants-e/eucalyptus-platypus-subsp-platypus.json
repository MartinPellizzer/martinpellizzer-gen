    "intro": "Eucalyptus platypus subsp. platypus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia, particularly in the states of Victoria and South Australia. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery bloom. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native vegetation in its range."
