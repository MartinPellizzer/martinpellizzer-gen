    "intro": "Eugenia elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf eugenia, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in moist, tropical or subtropical environments, growing in dense vegetation or along stream banks. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that may be edible, though it is not widely cultivated for human consumption."
