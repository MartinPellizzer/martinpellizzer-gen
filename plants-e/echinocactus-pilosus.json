    "intro": "Echinocactus pilosus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and a dense coating of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
