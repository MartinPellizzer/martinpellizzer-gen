It is characterized by its striking, fiery red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear during the dry season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The bark is smooth and often exudes a milky sap when injured."
