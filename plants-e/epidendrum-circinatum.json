    "intro": "Epidendrum circinatum, commonly known as the curly epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, spirally twisted leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum circinatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
