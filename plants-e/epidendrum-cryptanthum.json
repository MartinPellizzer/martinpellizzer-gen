It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Epidendrum cryptanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
