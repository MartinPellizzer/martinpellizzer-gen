    "intro": "Euphorbia globulosa, commonly known as the globular spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, round clusters of fleshy, green leaves that form a compact, globe-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
