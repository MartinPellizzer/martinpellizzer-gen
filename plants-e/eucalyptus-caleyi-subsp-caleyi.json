    "intro": "Eucalyptus caleyi subsp. caleyi, commonly known as the Caleyi mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped or elliptical leaves, which are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale or creamy white, blooming during the winter months. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
