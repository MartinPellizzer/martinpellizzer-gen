    "intro": "Eriophyllum parishii, commonly known as the Parish's goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to western North America, particularly found in California and Oregon. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, narrow leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriophyllum parishii is known for its early spring blooming period, adding a splash of yellow to the landscape before the summer heat."
