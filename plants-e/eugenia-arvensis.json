    "intro": "Eugenia arvensis, commonly known as the common eugenia, is a small shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are often used in culinary applications, particularly in jams and preserves. Eugenia arvensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soils."
