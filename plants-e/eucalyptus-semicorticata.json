    "intro": "Eucalyptus semicorticata, commonly known as the rough-barked apple gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color and often have a waxy coating. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces woody capsules that contain aromatic seeds. This species is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices."
