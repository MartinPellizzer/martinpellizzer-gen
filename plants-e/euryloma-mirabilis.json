    "intro": "Euryloma mirabilis, commonly known as the miraculous beauty, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, brightly colored blossoms. Euryloma mirabilis is known for its unique floral structure, which attracts specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
