It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a distinctive, rounded shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually densely packed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Elaphoglossum obtusum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
