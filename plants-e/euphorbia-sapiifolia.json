    "intro": "Euphorbia sapiifolia, commonly known as the sacred spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its tissues to survive drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
