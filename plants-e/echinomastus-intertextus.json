    "intro": "Echinomastus intertextus, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Echinomastus intertextus plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
