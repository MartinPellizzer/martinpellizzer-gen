    "intro": "Epidendrum cyclotellum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow petals and a velvety, dark green leaf surface. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are known for their long-lasting blooms, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. Epidendrum cyclotellum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
