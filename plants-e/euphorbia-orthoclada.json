    "intro": "Euphorbia orthoclada, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often spiny and may be reduced or absent in some varieties, contributing to its defensive adaptations. Euphorbia orthoclada is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
