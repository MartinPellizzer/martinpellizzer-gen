    "intro": "Eulalia pruinosa, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Eulalia pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
