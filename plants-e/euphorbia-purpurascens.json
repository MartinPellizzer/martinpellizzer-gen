    "intro": "Euphorbia purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with a distinctive purplish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. Euphorbia purpurascens is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
