    "intro": "Euphorbia prona, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It contains toxic milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it. Euphorbia prona is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
