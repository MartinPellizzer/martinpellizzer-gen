    "intro": "Erblichia antsingyae, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the Antsiranana region of Madagascar. It features a short, branching stem covered in spines and produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is notable for its striking appearance and rarity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
