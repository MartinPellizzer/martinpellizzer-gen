    "intro": "Eragrostis lehmanniana var. ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf-like growth."
