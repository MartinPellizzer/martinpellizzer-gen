    "intro": "Euphorbia chalicophila, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States. It features a branching stem covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax that gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
