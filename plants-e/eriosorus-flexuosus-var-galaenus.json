    "intro": "Eriosorus flexuosus var. galaenus, commonly known as the Galaeus fern, is a variant of the flexible wood fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a hairy surface, and its leaves are pinnately compound with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
