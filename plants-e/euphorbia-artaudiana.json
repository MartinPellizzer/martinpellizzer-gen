    "intro": "Euphorbia artaudiana, commonly known as the Artaud's spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties, contributing to its overall succulent appearance. Euphorbia artaudiana is adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
