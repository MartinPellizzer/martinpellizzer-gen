    "intro": "Evolvulus reniformis, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant is an annual vine that thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings. The flowers are typically blue or purple, though white and yellow varieties also exist."
