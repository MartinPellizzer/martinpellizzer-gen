    "intro": "Encephalartos vanhallii, commonly known as the Van Hall's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, fan-like arrangement of leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant conserve moisture in its arid habitat. This cycad produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Encephalartos vanhallii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
