    "intro": "Echidnium dubium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow or white flowers that appear during the cooler months, often in the early morning. The plant has a slender, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echidnium dubium is considered a vulnerable species."
