    "intro": "Erigeron peregrinus var. typicus, commonly known as the wandering bluet, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like blooms that attract pollinators. Its common name reflects its widespread distribution and the way its flowers seem to wander across the landscape."
