    "intro": "Euphorbia iberica var. intermedia, commonly known as the Iberian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Europe. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation or study."
