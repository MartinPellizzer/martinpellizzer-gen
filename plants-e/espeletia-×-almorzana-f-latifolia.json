    "intro": "Espeletia \u00d7 almorzana f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved almorzana, is a hybrid plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant is known for its large, broad, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowering stems produce dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This cultivar is often grown as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and hardy nature."
