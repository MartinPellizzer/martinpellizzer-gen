    "intro": "Escobaria tuberculosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival in arid environments. Escobaria tuberculosa is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
