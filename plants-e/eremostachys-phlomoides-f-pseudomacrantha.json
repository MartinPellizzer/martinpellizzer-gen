    "intro": "Eremostachys phlomoides f. pseudomacrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eryngo, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its stiff, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. This subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Eremostachys phlomoides."
