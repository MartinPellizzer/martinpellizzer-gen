    "intro": "Euphorbia thelephora, commonly known as the mountain euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thick, succulent stems that store water, adapting it to its arid, rocky habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often lobed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia thelephora is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in rocky, well-drained environments."
