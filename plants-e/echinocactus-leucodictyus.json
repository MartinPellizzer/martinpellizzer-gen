    "intro": "Echinocactus leucodictyus, commonly known as the white-ribbed cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and white or pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
