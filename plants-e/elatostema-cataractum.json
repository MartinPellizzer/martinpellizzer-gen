    "intro": "Elatostema cataractum, commonly known as the water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Australia. It has heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface, with the lower leaves submerged. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered near the water's edge. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss and aids in buoyancy. Elatostema cataractum plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
