    "intro": "Echium sabulicola subsp. rifeum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
