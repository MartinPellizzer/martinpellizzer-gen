    "intro": "Euphorbia medicaginea subsp. arsenariensis, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features succulent, ribbed stems and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a distinctive, branched structure with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
