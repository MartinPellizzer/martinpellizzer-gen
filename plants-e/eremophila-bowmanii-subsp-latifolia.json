    "intro": "Eremophila bowmanii subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of tubular, pink to red flowers that bloom in winter and spring. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. The subspecies latifolia is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other subspecies of Eremophila bowmanii."
