    "intro": "Erythrina batolobium, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is often smooth with a reddish hue. It produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Erythrina batolobium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
