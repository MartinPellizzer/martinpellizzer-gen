    "intro": "Epidryos matheusii, commonly known as the Matheus's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a compact, sympodial growth habit with a short rhizome and a few pairs of elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and pale greenish-white, with a unique structure that sets it apart from other orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epidryos matheusii is considered a critically endangered species."
