    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. obscura, commonly known as the dark euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features distinctive, falcate (spear-shaped) leaves that are dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
