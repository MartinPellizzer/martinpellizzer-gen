    "intro": "Euphorbia ephedroides var. imminuta, commonly known as the Indian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It features a short, branched stem with clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has spiny leaves and produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is closely related to other euphorbias and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
