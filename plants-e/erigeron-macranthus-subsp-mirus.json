It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its delicate blue to purple flowers. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
