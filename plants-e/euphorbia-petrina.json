    "intro": "Euphorbia petrina, commonly known as the common spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats. Euphorbia petrina is also known for its milky latex, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
