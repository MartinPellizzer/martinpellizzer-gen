    "intro": "Echinocactus durangensis, commonly known as the Durango cactus, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Durango, Mexico. It is a spineless cactus with a globular shape and dense, woolly covering that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
