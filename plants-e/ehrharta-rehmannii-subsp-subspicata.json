    "intro": "Ehrharta rehmannii subsp. subspicata, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to parts of eastern Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland or riparian areas."
