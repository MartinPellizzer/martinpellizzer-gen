    "intro": "Euonymus fulgens, commonly known as the fireball shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red-orange foliage that turns brilliant scarlet in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red, inflated seed capsules. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its striking color contrast. Euonymus fulgens thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
