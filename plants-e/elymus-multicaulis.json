    "intro": "Elymus multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Elymus multicaulis is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
