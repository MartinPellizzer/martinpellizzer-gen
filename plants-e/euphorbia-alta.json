    "intro": "Euphorbia alta, commonly known as the tall spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its erect stem and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia alta is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
