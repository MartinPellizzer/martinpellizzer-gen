    "intro": "Eriogonum ochrocephalum var. alexanderae, commonly known as the Alexander's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
