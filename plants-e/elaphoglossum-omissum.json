    "intro": "Elaphoglossum omissum, commonly known as the small fern or slender holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Elaphoglossum omissum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
