    "intro": "Echinopsis courantii, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It features a tall, columnar stem with a spiny, ribbed structure that helps it store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in the evening. Its adaptations to arid environments include a shallow root system and a waxy cuticle on its surface. Echinopsis courantii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
