It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological studies and horticultural interest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
