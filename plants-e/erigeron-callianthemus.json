It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its blue to violet flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often found in isolated mountainous areas."
