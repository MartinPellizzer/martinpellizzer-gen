    "intro": "Eugenia cotinifolioides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features compound leaves with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
