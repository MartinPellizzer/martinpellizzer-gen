    "intro": "Eriospermum coralliferum, commonly known as the coralseed eriosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny, coral-like seeds, giving it its common name. Eriospermum coralliferum is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
