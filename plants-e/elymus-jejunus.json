    "intro": "Elymus jejunus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Elymus jejunus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
