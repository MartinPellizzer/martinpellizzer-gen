    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa subsp. abyssinica, commonly known as Abyssinian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Ethiopia and neighboring regions of the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, slender leaves that are often covered with fine, erect hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
