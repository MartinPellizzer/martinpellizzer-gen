    "intro": "Euphorbia gerardiana var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
