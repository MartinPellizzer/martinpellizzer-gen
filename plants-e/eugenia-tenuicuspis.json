    "intro": "Eugenia tenuicuspis, commonly known as the narrow-cusp guava, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and a distinctively narrow cusp at the leaf tip. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, aromatic berries. The fruit is typically small, with a yellow or red skin and a sweet, juicy pulp, making it a valuable crop in some tropical regions."
