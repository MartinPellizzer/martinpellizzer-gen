    "intro": "Euphorbia lupatensis, commonly known as the Lupa's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in arid or rocky environments. Euphorbia lupatensis is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
