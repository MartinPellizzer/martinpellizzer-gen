    "intro": "Echinocactus interruptus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Echinocactus interruptus is well adapted to harsh desert environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
