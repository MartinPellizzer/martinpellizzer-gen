    "intro": "Elaphrium trinitense, commonly known as the Trinidad elaphrium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a velvety texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
