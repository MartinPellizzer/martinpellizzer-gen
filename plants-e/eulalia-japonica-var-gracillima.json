It features slender, arching blades that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant produces feathery plumes in late summer, which add a soft, airy texture to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
