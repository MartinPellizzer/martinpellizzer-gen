    "intro": "Espeletia curialensis var. curialensis, commonly known as the Curialense heath, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the high Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with dense clusters of silver-gray, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, daisy-like flower heads that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important component of the Andean p\u00e1ramo ecosystem."
