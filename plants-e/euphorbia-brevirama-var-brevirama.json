    "intro": "Euphorbia brevirama var. brevirama, commonly known as the short-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
