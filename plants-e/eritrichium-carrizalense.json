    "intro": "Eritrichium carrizalense, commonly known as the Carrizalense mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, dry climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
