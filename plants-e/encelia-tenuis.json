    "intro": "Encelia tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf encelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as scrublands and sandy soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers bloom in spring. Encelia tenuis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
