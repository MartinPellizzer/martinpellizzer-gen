    "intro": "Eragrostis pilgeri subsp. pilgeri, commonly known as the Pilger's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
