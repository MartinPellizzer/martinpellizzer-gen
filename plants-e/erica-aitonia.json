    "intro": "Erica aitonia, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Erica aitonia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
