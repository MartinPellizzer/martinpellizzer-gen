    "intro": "Esenbeckia grandiflora subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered esenbeckia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
