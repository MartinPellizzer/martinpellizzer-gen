    "intro": "Elatostema griffithianum var. minor, commonly known as the small leaf elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its small, often heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, and is often found in rocky or clay soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. This variant is distinguished from the typical Elatostema griffithianum by its smaller size and more delicate foliage."
