    "intro": "Euphorbia cyparissioides, commonly known as the cypress spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features a distinctive, compact growth habit with narrow, dark green leaves that resemble those of a cypress tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its upright form and seasonal flowering, though it can be toxic if ingested."
