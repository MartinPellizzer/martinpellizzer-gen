    "intro": "Epidorkis guoyaniana, commonly known as the Guoyaniana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Epidorkis guoyaniana is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
