    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus var. fastigiatus, commonly known as the Japanese spindle tree or upright euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features narrow, upright growth with glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used as a decorative hedge or specimen plant. Its dense foliage and year-round color make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
