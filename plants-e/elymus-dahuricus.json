    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high altitudes. Elymus dahuricus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
