    "intro": "Eugenia iantarensis, commonly known as the Iantare mango, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Samoa and American Samoa. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark red to black berries that are rich in antioxidants. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and emit a distinctive fragrance when crushed. The fruit is valued for its sweet, aromatic pulp and is an important food source for both humans and wildlife in its native habitat."
