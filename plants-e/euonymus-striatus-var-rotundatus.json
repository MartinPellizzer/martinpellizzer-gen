    "intro": "Euonymus striatus var. rotundatus, commonly known as the red-fruit euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage and showy fruits, making it a popular choice for gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, and is relatively easy to maintain."
