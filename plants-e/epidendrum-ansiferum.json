It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of brightly colored, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Epidendrum ansiferum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
