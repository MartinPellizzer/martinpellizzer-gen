    "intro": "Echiochilon fruticosum, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland saline areas. Echiochilon fruticosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
