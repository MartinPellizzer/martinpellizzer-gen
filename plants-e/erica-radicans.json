    "intro": "Erica radicans, commonly known as the trailing heath or evergreen heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica radicans is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
