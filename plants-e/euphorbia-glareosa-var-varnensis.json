    "intro": "Euphorbia glareosa var. varnensis, commonly known as the Varnensian euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its stems. This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
