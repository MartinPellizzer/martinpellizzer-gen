    "intro": "Euphorbia buqensis, commonly known as the Buraq euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Euphorbia buqensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
