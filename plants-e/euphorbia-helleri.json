    "intro": "Euphorbia helleri, commonly known as the Heller's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia helleri is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, which helps it survive in dry conditions."
