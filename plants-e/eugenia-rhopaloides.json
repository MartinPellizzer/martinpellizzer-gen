    "intro": "Eugenia rhopaloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Eugenia rhopaloides is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
