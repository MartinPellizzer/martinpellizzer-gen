The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
