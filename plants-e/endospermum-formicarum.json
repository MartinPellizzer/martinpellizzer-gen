    "intro": "Endospermum formicarum, commonly known as the honeycomb tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, honeycomb-like bark that peels in layers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody fruits containing seeds. Its roots are known to exude a sticky, resinous substance that has been traditionally used by Indigenous Australians. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
