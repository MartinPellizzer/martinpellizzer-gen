    "intro": "Erigeron saracachiensis, commonly known as the Saracach\u00ed fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly found in Guatemala. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
