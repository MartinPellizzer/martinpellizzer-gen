    "intro": "Euphorbia dissimilis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival. Euphorbia dissimilis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
