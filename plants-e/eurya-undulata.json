    "intro": "Eurya undulata, commonly known as the wavyleaf eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, wavy-edged leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Eurya undulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
