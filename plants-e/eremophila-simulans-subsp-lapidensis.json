    "intro": "Eremophila simulans subsp. lapidensis, commonly known as the rock eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often appearing in clusters. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
