    "intro": "Eucalyptus gunnii var. elata, commonly known as the tall mallees, is a variant of the Eucalyptus gunnii species native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a striking silver-gray underlayer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue-green coloration. This plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or cream in color. It is well adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat and is often found in open forests and heathlands."
