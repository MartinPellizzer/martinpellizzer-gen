    "intro": "Exospermum, commonly known as the \"Australian tea tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have a strong, camphor-like scent. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its natural propagation."
