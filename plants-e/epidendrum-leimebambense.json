    "intro": "Epidendrum leimebambense, commonly known as the bamboo orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, bamboo-like stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum leimebambense is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
