    "intro": "Euphorbia tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, woody stem with narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution."
