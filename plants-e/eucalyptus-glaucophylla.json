    "intro": "Eucalyptus glaucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Eucalyptus glaucophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
