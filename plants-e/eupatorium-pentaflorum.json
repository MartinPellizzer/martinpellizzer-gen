    "intro": "Eupatorium pentaflorum, commonly known as the five-flowered eupatorium, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive silvery-white underside, adding to its ornamental value. Eupatorium pentaflorum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
