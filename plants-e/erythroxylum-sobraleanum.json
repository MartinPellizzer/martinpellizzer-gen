It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. It produces small, round berries that contain the plant's psychoactive alkaloid, cocaine. Due to its chemical composition, it is of both scientific and legal interest."
