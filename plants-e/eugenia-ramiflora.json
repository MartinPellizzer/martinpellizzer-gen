    "intro": "Eugenia ramiflora, commonly known as the fragrant guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that emit a sweet, aromatic scent, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit, which resembles a small guava, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic foliage and fruit."
