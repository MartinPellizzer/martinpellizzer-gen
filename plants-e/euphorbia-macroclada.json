    "intro": "Euphorbia macroclada, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
