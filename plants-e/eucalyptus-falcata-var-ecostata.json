    "intro": "Eucalyptus falcata var. ecostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringy gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath, and it produces distinctive, pendulous flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. The bark is typically flaky and fibrous, peeling in strips to reveal a smoother surface underneath. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses by Indigenous communities."
