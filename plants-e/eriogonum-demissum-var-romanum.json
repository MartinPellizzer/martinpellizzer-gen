    "intro": "Eriogonum demissum var. romanum, commonly known as the Roman's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Polygonaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
