    "intro": "Epidendrum cuspidatum, commonly known as the toothed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum cuspidatum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
