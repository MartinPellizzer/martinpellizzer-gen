    "intro": "Euphorbia ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Euphorbia ridleyi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in tropical conditions."
