    "intro": "Ephedra triandra, commonly known as the Indian ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is now regulated in many countries."
