    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium f. uniceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cotton grass, is a variant of the cotton grass genus characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that typically thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common feature among members of the Cyperaceae family. Its morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves with a central stem bearing the inflorescence. This form is distinguished by its reduced number of inflorescence branches, giving it a more compact appearance compared to other cotton grass species."
