It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum brachymischum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
