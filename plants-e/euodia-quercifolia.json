    "intro": "Euodia quercifolia, commonly known as the Chinese quince or Chinese sandpaper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of the oak, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored drupe that ripens in autumn. Euodia quercifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
