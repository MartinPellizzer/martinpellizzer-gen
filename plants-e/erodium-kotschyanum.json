    "intro": "Erodium kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kashmir erodium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Pakistan and India. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is often found in alpine meadows. Erodium kotschyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
