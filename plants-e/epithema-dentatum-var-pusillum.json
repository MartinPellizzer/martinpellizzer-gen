    "intro": "Epithema dentatum var. pusillum, commonly known as the small-toothed epithema, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often associated with slow-moving streams and ponds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality."
