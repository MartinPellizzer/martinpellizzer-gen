    "intro": "Elymus glaucifolius var. crescendus, commonly known as the silverleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
