    "intro": "Euphorbia ramiglans, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branched stem covered in dense, silver-gray hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
