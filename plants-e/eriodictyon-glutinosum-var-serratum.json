    "intro": "Eriodictyon glutinosum var. serratum, commonly known as the Sierra buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for some wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional use by indigenous communities."
