    "intro": "Espeletia raquirensis, commonly known as the Chunch\u00fan, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and dense clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Espeletia raquirensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its region."
