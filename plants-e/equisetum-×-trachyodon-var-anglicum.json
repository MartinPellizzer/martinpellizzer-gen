    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 trachyodon var. anglicum, commonly known as the English horsetail, is a hybrid plant in the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces fertile cones at the top of the stem, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
