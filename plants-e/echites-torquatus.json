It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant is a climbing vine with woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed and produce a sweet, nectar-rich reward for its pollinators. Echites torquatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in gardens and natural habitats."
