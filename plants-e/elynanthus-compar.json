It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability through root nodules. The plant features trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it can become invasive in certain regions."
