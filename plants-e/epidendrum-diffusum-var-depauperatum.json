    "intro": "Epidendrum diffusum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the poor stem epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and relatively small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
