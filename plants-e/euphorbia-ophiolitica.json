    "intro": "Euphorbia ophiolitica, commonly known as the Ophiolite spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
