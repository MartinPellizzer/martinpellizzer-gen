    "intro": "Euphorbia bulleyana, commonly known as the Chinese spurge, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features striking, palmate leaves that turn reddish in autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
