    "intro": "Euphorbia uzmuk, commonly known as the Turk's Cap Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features distinctive, cup-shaped orange or yellow cyathia, which are modified inflorescences that serve as a means of attracting pollinators. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in well-drained soils. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
