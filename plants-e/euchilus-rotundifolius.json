    "intro": "Euchilus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leafed spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically rounded or oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions. The species is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
