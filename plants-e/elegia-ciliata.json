It features slender, trailing stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine cilia, contributing to its common name. Elegia ciliata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and color."
