    "intro": "Eriogonum flavum var. crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf flaxflower, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, yellowish to golden flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
