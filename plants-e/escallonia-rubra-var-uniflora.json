    "intro": "Escallonia rubra var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower escallonia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, glossy dark green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its showy, tubular red flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blooms in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
