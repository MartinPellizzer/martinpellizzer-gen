    "intro": "Euphorbia rigida, commonly known as the rigid spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
