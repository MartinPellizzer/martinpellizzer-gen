    "intro": "Euphorbia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features grayish-green, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas. Euphorbia atlantica is known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it drought-tolerant."
