    "intro": "Echinops minimus, commonly known as the lesser thistle, is a small, annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features spiny, bristly stems and produces small, spherical flower heads that are typically blue to purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Echinops minimus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
