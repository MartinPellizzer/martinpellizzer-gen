    "intro": "Eupatorium subpenninervium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf thoroughwort, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called cymes. Its leaves are often finely toothed, and the plant is typically found in moist, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though its botanical properties are not as well-documented as those of other Eupatorium species."
