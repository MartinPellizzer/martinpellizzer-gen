    "intro": "Epidendrum tulcanense, commonly known as the Tulc\u00e1n orchid, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in Mexico and Guatemala. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces striking clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
