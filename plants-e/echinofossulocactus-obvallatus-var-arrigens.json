    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus obvallatus var. arrigens, commonly known as the Arrigens barrel cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to a small region in Mexico. This variety is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the base of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
