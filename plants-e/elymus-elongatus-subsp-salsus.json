    "intro": "Elymus elongatus subsp. salsus, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salinity and drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in degraded or saline habitats. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize challenging soils."
