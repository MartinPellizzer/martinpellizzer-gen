    "intro": "Euphorbia brachycera, commonly known as the short-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically small, oblanceolate, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia brachycera is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
