It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements make it a favored plant among succulent enthusiasts."
