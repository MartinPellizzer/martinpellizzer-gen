    "intro": "Edritria laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-edged fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically smooth along the edges. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Edritria laevigata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
