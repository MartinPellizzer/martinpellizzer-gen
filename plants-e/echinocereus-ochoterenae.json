It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-gray in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. This resilient plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
