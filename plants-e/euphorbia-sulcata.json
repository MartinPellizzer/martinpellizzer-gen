    "intro": "Euphorbia sulcata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, and it stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Euphorbia sulcata is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
