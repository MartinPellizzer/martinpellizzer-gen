    "intro": "Endlicheria chalisea, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-bearing capsules after flowering. Endlicheria chalisea is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
