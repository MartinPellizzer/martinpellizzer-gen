    "intro": "Erica insolitanthera, commonly known as the solitary-throat heath, is a rare and unique species native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant's most distinguishing feature is its solitary, elongated floral tube, which gives it its specific epithet \"insolitanthera.\" It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
