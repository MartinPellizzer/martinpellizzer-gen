    "intro": "Elcismia rutlandii, commonly known as Rutland's elcismia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elcismia rutlandii is considered a vulnerable species."
