    "intro": "Euphorbia radiifera, commonly known as the radiate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. It produces a milky sap that can be irritant to the skin. Euphorbia radiifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
