It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments. It is an epiphytic to lithophytic species, often found clinging to rock surfaces or growing in crevices. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation efforts."
