    "intro": "Eriococcus hamiltonianus, commonly known as the Hamilton's eriococcus, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Diaspididae. It is characterized by its small, elongated body covered in a waxy, cotton-like coating. The plant it infests is typically a host-specific species, often found on the leaves of certain shrubs and trees. Its feeding habits can cause distortion or discoloration of the host plant's foliage. Due to its specialized nature, it is of interest in botanical studies related to plant-insect interactions and ecological relationships."
