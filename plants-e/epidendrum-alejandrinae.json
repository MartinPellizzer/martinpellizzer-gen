    "intro": "Epidendrum alejandrinae, commonly known as the Alexander's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet and green floral bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Epidendrum alejandrinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
