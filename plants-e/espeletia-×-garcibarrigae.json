    "intro": "Espeletia \u00d7 garcibarrigae, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo Queen,\" is a hybrid plant native to the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, humid conditions. Its flowering heads are usually small and clustered, producing yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
