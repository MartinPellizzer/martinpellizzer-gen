It features vibrant, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it thrives in well-draining soil with consistent moisture. Epidendrum mirabile is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate for indoor or greenhouse settings."
