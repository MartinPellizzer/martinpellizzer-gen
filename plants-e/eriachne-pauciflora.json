    "intro": "Eriachne pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered eriachne, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in spike-like clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
