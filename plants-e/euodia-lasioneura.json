It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Euodia lasioneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
