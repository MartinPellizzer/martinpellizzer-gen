    "intro": "Eremophila annosocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem. Eremophila annosocaulis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water gardens."
