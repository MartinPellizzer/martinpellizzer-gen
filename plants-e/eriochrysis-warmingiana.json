    "intro": "Eriochrysis warmingiana, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in wet, coastal environments, such as salt marshes and dunes, where it thrives in brackish or saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Eriochrysis warmingiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
