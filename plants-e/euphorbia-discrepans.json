    "intro": "Euphorbia discrepans, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically alternate and may be reduced or absent in some varieties. Euphorbia discrepans is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
