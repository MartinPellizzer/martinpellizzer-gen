It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine environments, often in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are densely packed, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
