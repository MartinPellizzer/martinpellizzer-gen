    "intro": "Evelyna hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's evelyna, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
