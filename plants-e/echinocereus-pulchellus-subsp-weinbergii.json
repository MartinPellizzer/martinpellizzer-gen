    "intro": "Echinocereus pulchellus subsp. weinbergii, commonly known as the Weinberg's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mound-forming cactus characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and hardy nature make it a distinctive addition to desert gardens."
