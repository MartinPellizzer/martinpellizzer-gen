    "intro": "Euphorbia odontophora, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often serrated or toothed, giving it its common name. Euphorbia odontophora is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
