    "intro": "Eugenia pallidifolia, commonly known as the pale-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically pale green to white on the underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Eugenia pallidifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
