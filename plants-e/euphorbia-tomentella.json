    "intro": "Euphorbia tomentella, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 (flowers) that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may be lance-shaped or oval, and it often grows in low, compact forms. Euphorbia tomentella is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
