    "intro": "Eriophyllum superbum, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-filled flower heads that resemble small crowns. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats. Eriophyllum superbum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
