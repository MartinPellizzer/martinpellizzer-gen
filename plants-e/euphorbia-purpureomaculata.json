    "intro": "Euphorbia purpureomaculata, commonly known as the purple-spotted spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a layer of white, waxy bark. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically green with purple or reddish markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Euphorbia purpureomaculata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
