    "intro": "Echeandia falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, spine-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Echeandia falcata is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its foliage is reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and provide protection from herbivores."
