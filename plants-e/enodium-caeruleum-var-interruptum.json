It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet, often with a distinctive interruption or break in the petal pattern. The plant grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
