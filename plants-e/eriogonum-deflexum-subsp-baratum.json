    "intro": "Eriogonum deflexum subsp. baratum, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces showy, pale pink to white flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its subspecies status reflects geographic and morphological distinctions from other Eriogonum species."
