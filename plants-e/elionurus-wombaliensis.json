    "intro": "Elionurus wombaliensis, commonly known as the Wombali grass, is a unique grass species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering spikes are small and clustered, producing light green to yellowish flowers that bloom during the wet season. Elionurus wombaliensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional practices by local communities."
