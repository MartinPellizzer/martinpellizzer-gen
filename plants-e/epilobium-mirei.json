    "intro": "Epilobium mirei, commonly known as the marsh willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Epilobium mirei is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
