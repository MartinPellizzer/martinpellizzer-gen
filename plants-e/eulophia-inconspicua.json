The plant typically features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often clustered in a raceme. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Eulophia inconspicua is noted for its relatively inconspicuous appearance, which contributes to its common name."
