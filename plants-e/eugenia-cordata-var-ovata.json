It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
