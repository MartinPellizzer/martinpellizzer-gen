    "intro": "Euonymus radicans var. minimus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover ground and tolerate various soil conditions. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal color changes."
