    "intro": "Erysimum witmannii, commonly known as the Witmann's wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Erysimum witmannii is adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
