    "intro": "Epidendrum oxyphyllum, commonly known as the white-flowered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, pendulous inflorescences with white to pale pink flowers that have a distinctive, almost waxy appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Epidendrum oxyphyllum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
