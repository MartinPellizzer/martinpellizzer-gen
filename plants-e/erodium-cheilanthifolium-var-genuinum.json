It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
