    "intro": "Eucalyptus coolabah subsp. arida, commonly known as the arid coolabah, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves which are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically flowering in spring. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of dryland ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in reforestation efforts."
