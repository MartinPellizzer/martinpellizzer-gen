It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant produces striking white to pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
