    "intro": "Eucalyptus ochrophloia, commonly known as the white-leafed eucalypt, is a species native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus ochrophloia is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often found in open forests and heathlands. Its foliage and flowers contribute to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
