    "intro": "Euphorbia grandifolia, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow bracts that surround small, greenish flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has a woody stem with a thick, fleshy trunk and produces milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture. Euphorbia grandifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
