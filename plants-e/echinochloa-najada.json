    "intro": "Echinochloa najada, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate aquatic habitats. Echinochloa najada plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
