It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Euphrasia carniolica is often found in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
