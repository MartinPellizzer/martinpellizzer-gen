    "intro": "Eclipta dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Eclipta dichotoma is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other daisy-like plants."
