    "intro": "Eugenia virens, commonly known as the common myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its fruit, a small, dark purple berry, is edible but not commonly consumed. Eugenia virens thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
