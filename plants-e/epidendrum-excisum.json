    "intro": "Epidendrum excisum, commonly known as the excised epidendron, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum excisum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
