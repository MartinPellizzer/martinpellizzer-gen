    "intro": "Euphorbia perarmata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia perarmata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
