    "intro": "Euonymus glaber, commonly known as the smooth euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features simple, opposite, elliptic leaves that are smooth on both sides, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its adaptability to various soil types and sunlight conditions makes it a popular ornamental plant. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
