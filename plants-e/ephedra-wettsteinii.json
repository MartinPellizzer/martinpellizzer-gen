    "intro": "Ephedra wettsteinii, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its green, branched stems that resemble joints, and it produces small, spherical seed pods. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy stems that help reduce water loss. It contains ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many regions."
