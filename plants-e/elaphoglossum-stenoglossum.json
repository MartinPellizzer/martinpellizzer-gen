    "intro": "Elaphoglossum stenoglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in tropical and subtropical regions. Elaphoglossum stenoglossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
