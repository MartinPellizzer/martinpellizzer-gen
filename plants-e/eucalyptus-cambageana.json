    "intro": "Eucalyptus cambageana, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its grey-barked trunk and branches, and its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for local timber use. Eucalyptus cambageana is also an important species for biodiversity, providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
