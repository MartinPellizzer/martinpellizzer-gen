It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
