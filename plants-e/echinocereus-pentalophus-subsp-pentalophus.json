    "intro": "Echinocereus pentalophus subsp. pentalophus, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a compact, rounded shape and typically produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Its stems are ribbed and covered in clusters of small, hooked spines, which provide protection from herbivores. It is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
