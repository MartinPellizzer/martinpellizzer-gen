    "intro": "Elaphoglossum multisquamosum, commonly known as the multiscaly holly fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are often distinguishable from the sterile fronds. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
