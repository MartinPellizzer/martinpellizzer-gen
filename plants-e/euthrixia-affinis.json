    "intro": "Euthrixia affinis, commonly known as the common wax scale, is a small, sedentary insect that belongs to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its waxy secretions that cover its body, providing protection against predators and environmental stressors. The plant it infests is typically a woody species, where it feeds on the sap, causing potential damage to the host's growth and health. Its life cycle involves overwintering as a nymph and developing into an adult in the spring. This pest is often found on the stems and branches of various shrubs and trees in temperate regions."
