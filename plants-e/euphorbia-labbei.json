    "intro": "Euphorbia labbei, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Natal euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem with a smooth, greenish-gray bark that helps it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it is adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia labbei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
