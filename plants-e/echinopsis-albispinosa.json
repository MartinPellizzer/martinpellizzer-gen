    "intro": "Echinopsis albispinosa, commonly known as the white-spined night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in white spines, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and botanical gardens."
