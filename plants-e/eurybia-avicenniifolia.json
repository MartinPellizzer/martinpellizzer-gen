    "intro": "Eurybia avicenniifolia, commonly known as coastal knapweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear small, daisy-like yellow flowers. Eurybia avicenniifolia is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species found in maritime environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local insect populations."
