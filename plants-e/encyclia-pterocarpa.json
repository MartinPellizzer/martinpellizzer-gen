    "intro": "Encyclia pterocarpa, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. The flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple lip, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
