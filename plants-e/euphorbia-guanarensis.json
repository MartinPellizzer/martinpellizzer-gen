    "intro": "Euphorbia guanarensis, commonly known as the Guanarensis Spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stems and succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Euphorbia guanarensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and irritate the skin."
