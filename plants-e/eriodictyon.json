    "intro": "Eriodictyon, commonly known as poison root, is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. It is native to western North America, particularly California and Oregon, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its hairy, often blue or purple flowers and its distinctive, glandular leaves that can release a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. Several species within the genus are used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples for their purported healing properties. However, some species contain toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation or more severe reactions if ingested."
