It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
