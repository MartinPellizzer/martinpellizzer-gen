    "intro": "Epidendrum ophioglossoides, commonly known as the Orchid of the Forest, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. The flowers bloom during the rainy season, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
