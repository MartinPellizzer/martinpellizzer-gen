    "intro": "Euphorbia cornuta, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, horn-like stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia cornuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
