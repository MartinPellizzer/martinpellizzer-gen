    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved willowherb, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often nitrogen-rich soils, such as those found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, adorned with lance-shaped, hairy leaves. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Epilobium \u00d7 stenophyllum is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a characteristic species of calcareous wetlands."
