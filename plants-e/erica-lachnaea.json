    "intro": "Erica lachnaea, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dense, leathery, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Erica lachnaea is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
