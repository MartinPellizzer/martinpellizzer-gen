    "intro": "Euphorbia milii var. milii, commonly known as Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it store water and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers but modified leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
