    "intro": "Epilobium royleanum f. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous willow herb, is a variant of the willow herb species native to the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is notable for its smooth, hairless appearance, distinguishing it from other forms of Epilobium royleanum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows."
