    "intro": "Erythronium propullans, commonly known as the pushing bell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive red or orange throat. The plant has a corm-like underground stem, which helps it survive in its alpine or subalpine habitat. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are typically broad and heart-shaped. Erythronium propullans is adapted to cool, moist environments and blooms in early spring."
