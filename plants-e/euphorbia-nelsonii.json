    "intro": "Euphorbia nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes."
