    "intro": "Echinops onopordum, commonly known as the thorny-headed coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant features a tall, upright growth habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is the spherical, spiky seed head that resembles a small, prickly globe, which becomes prominent in late summer and autumn. Echinops onopordum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
