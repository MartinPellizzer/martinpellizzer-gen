    "intro": "Elaphoglossum catharinae, commonly known as the Catharina holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum catharinae is considered a species of conservation concern."
