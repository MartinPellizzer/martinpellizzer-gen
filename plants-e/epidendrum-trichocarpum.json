    "intro": "Epidendrum trichocarpum, commonly known as the Trichocarpum Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and relatively small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum trichocarpum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in tropical gardens."
