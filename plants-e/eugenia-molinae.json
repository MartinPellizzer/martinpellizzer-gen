    "intro": "Eugenia molinae, commonly known as the Molina's guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pinkish-red fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Eugenia molinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens."
