    "intro": "Eryngium pandanifolium, commonly known as the pandan-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, spiny flower heads that resemble a thistle, surrounded by blue to purple bracts. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eryngium pandanifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
