    "intro": "Echinochloa crus-galli var. hispida, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a widely distributed annual grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, narrow leaves, and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets with hairy bracts, which give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a significant weed in many crops."
