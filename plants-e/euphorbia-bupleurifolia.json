    "intro": "Euphorbia bupleurifolia, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and cliffs. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native habitat."
