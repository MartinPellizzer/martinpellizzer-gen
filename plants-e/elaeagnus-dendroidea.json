    "intro": "Elaeagnus dendroidea, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white bark, which becomes flaky and fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are typically 4 to 8 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Elaeagnus dendroidea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
