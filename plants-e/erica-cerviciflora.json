    "intro": "Erica cerviciflora, commonly known as the rock heath or coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. Erica cerviciflora is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
