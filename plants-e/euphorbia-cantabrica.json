    "intro": "Euphorbia cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, spine-tipped leaves and a branched stem system that helps it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
