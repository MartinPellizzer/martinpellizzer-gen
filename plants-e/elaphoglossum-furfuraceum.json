    "intro": "Elaphoglossum furfuraceum, commonly known as the hairy elaphoglossum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Elaphoglossum furfuraceum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
