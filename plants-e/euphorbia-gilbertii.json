    "intro": "Euphorbia gilbertii, commonly known as Gilbert's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or grayish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Euphorbia gilbertii is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and striking appearance."
