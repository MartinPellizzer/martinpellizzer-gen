    "intro": "Eumorpha nobilis, commonly known as the White Witch butterfly, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in the Americas. It is characterized by its striking black wings with white markings and a long, slender body. The plant association of Eumorpha nobilis is primarily with the genus Passiflora, as the larvae feed on various species of passionflower. The adult butterflies are often seen fluttering around these plants, contributing to pollination. Its presence in gardens and natural habitats can enhance biodiversity and ecological balance."
