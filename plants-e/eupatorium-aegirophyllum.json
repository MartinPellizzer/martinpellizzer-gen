    "intro": "Eupatorium aegirophyllum, commonly known as the seaside eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its adaptability to saline environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Eupatorium aegirophyllum plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
