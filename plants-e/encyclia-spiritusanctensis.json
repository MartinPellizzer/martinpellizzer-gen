    "intro": "Encyclia spiritusanctensis, commonly known as the Spiritus Sanctiensis Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
