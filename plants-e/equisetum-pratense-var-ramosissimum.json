    "intro": "Equisetum pratense var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the bristly field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and a distinct, segmented stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in wetland environments. This variety is notable for its dense growth habit and its historical use in traditional medicine."
