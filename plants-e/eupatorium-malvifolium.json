    "intro": "Eupatorium malvifolium, commonly known as white boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and along stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
