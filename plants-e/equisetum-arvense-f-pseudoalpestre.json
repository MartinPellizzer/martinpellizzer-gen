    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. pseudoalpestre, commonly known as the alpine field horsetail, is a variant of the common field horsetail. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spore-bearing cones and segmented, jointed stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This form is adapted to more alpine or high-altitude environments compared to the typical variety."
