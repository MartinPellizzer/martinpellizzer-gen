    "intro": "Elaphoglossum skutchianum, commonly known as the Skutch's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or upright, depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a hymenium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the genus Elaphoglossum."
