    "intro": "Epilobium nuristanicum, commonly known as the Nuristan willow herb, is a flowering plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, alternate leaves, and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
