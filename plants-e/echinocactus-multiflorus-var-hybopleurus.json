    "intro": "Echinocactus multiflorus var. hybopleurus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
