    "intro": "Eupatorium perfoliatum, commonly known as boneset, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The leaves are opposite, with toothed margins and often have a distinctive appearance with veins that appear to be \"perforated\" by the stems. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its fever-reducing and anti-inflammatory effects."
