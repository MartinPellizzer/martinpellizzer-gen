    "intro": "Erica parviflora var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This hardy species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its resilience and ornamental appeal."
