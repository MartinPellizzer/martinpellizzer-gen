It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
