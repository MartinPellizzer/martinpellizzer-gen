    "intro": "Eugenia triantha, commonly known as the three-lobed eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, though it is not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenia triantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a specimen plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
