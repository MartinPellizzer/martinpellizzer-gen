    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish horse tail, is a variant of the horsetail plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features."
