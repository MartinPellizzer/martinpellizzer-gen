It is characterized by its dark green to blue-green stems, which are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at night. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
