    "intro": "Erigeron foliosus var. confinis, commonly known as the coastal blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly along coastal regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
