    "intro": "Euphorbion anacampserum, commonly known as the white spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the spurge family. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, clustered flowers are usually yellow or green, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
