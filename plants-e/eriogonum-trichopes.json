    "intro": "Eriogonum trichopes, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum trichopes is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and sagebrush habitats."
