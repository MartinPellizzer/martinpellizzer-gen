    "intro": "Echinopsis amblayensis var. albispina, commonly known as the White-spined Echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that often branches into multiple stems, forming a bushy appearance. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
