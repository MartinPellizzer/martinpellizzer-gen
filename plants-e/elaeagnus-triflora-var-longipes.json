    "intro": "Elaeagnus triflora var. longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, red berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
