    "intro": "Erica bodkinii, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in winter, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden. Erica bodkinii thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is drought tolerant once established."
