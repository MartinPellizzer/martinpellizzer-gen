    "intro": "Epischoenus villosus, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in moist habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in temperate regions. Epischoenus villosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
