    "intro": "Epilobium apricum, commonly known as the spring willow herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Epilobium apricum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
