    "intro": "Erythraea tenuifolia subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal erythraea, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic inundation. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
