    "intro": "Evolvulus arbuscula, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The species is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
