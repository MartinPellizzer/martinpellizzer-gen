    "intro": "Eucalyptus agglomerata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Stringy Gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often grey-green in color and its stringy, fibrous bark that peels in long strips. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are widely used in medicinal and aromatic applications. Eucalyptus agglomerata is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
