    "intro": "Epilobium rupicola, commonly known as rockwillow or mountain willow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Epilobium rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
