    "intro": "Eugenia chinensis, commonly known as Chinese guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pinkish-red berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have a tart, sweet flavor. Eugenia chinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a fruit-bearing plant in subtropical regions."
