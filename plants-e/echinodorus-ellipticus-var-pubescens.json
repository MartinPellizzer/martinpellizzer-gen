    "intro": "Echinodorus ellipticus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy broad-leaf waterweed, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its varietal name. The plant thrives in slow to moderately flowing freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful oxygenator and a potential invasive species in non-native waters. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color."
