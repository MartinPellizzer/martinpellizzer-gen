    "intro": "Elephantusia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited elephant tree, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in dense inflorescences, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
