    "intro": "Euphoria litchi var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy litchi, is a unique variant of the litchi species characterized by its distinctive wavy leaf margins. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of round, red-skinned fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a glossy surface. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit, which is rich in vitamins and antioxidants."
