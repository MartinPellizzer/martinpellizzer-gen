    "intro": "Euphorbia vandermerwei, commonly known as the Vandermerwe's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with prominent, spiny leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
