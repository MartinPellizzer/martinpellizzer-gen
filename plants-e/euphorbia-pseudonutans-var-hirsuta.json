    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudonutans var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a variant of the spurge plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, thick, and fleshy stems that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that emerge from a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant adapted to drought conditions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation."
