    "intro": "Espeletia spicata, commonly known as the \"Puya\" or \"Snowflower,\" is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, spiky leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces tall, showy inflorescences that can reach several meters in height, bearing numerous small, often brightly colored flowers. Espeletia spicata thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in Andean ecosystems."
