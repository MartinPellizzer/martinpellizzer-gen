    "intro": "Eucalyptus globulus var. stjohnii, commonly known as the St. John's malleable, is a variant of the common eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some uses in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
