    "intro": "Elymus transhyrcanus, commonly known as the Trans-Hyrkanian grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Elymus transhyrcanus is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
