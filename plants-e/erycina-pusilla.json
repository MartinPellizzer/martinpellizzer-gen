    "intro": "Erycina pusilla, commonly known as the small orchid, is a diminutive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of tiny, clustered flowers. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, Erycina pusilla is a rare and delicate species that is often overlooked in botanical studies."
