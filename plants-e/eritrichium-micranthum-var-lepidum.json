    "intro": "Eritrichium micranthum var. lepidum, commonly known as the silverleaf mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in alpine and mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
