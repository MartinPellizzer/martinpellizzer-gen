    "intro": "Euphorbia sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and branched stems, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
