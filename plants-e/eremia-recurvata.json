    "intro": "Eremia recurvata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Eremia recurvata plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
