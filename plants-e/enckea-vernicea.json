    "intro": "Enckea vernicea, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark that has a glossy, almost waxy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly velvety texture. Enckea vernicea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique bark and foliage."
