    "intro": "Ecbolium helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's ecbolium, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, often in rocky or sandy soils with high sunlight exposure. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Ecbolium helferi is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
