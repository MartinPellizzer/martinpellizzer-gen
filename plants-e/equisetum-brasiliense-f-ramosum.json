    "intro": "Equisetum brasiliense f. ramosum, commonly known as the Brazilian horsetail, is a fern-like plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and spore-bearing structures. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant exhibits a unique combination of primitive and advanced features, including a hollow stem and a lack of true leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary history as one of the oldest groups of vascular plants."
