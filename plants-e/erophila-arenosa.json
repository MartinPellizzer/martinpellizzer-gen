    "intro": "Erophila arenosa, commonly known as sand spurrey, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and along shorelines. The plant has small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters and blooming in the summer months. Erophila arenosa is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife."
