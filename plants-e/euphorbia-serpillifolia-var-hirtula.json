    "intro": "Euphorbia serpillifolia var. hirtula, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
