    "intro": "Eria pholidotoides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Eria pholidotoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
