    "intro": "Epidendrum hemihenomenum, commonly known as the pink-tipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive under proper care."
