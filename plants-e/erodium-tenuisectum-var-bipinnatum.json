    "intro": "Erodium tenuisectum var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved erodium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish to white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
