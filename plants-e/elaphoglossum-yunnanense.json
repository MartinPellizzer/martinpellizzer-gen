    "intro": "Elaphoglossum yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan holly fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often more compact than the sterile ones. Elaphoglossum yunnanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
