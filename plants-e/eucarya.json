    "intro": "Eucarya, commonly known as the eukaryotes, refers to a domain of living organisms characterized by cells that contain a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. This domain includes a vast array of life forms, such as animals, plants, fungi, and protists. Eukaryotic cells are more complex than prokaryotic cells, with specialized structures that support diverse biological functions. The term \"Eucarya\" was introduced to distinguish these organisms from prokaryotes like bacteria and archaea. This classification is fundamental in understanding the evolutionary relationships and cellular complexity across different life forms."
