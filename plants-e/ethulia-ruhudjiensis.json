    "intro": "Ethulia ruhudjiensis, commonly known as the Ruhudji orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include a slender stem and broad, glossy leaves that help it thrive in humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
