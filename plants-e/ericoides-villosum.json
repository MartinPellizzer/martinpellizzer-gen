    "intro": "Ericoides villosum, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides villosum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small mammals."
