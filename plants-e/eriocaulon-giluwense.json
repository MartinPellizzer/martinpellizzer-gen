    "intro": "Eriocaulon giluwense, commonly known as the Giluwense spikegrass, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid environment. Eriocaulon giluwense is typically found in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of tropical wetland ecosystems."
