    "intro": "Empedoclea alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shady environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant features palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of alder trees, hence its common name. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Empedoclea alnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
