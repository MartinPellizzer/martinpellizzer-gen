    "intro": "Eucalyptus griffithsii, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dull green and aromatic. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its timber is valued for its strength and workability, though it is now considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Eucalyptus griffithsii plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
