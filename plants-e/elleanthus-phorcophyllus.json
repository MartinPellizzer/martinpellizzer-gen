    "intro": "Elleanthus phorcophyllus, commonly known as the golden flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fibrous stalks were historically used by indigenous peoples for making rope and textiles. Elleanthus phorcophyllus is also valued in modern horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
