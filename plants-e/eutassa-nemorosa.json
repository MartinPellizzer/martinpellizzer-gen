    "intro": "Eutassa nemorosa, commonly known as the woodland lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eutassa nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
