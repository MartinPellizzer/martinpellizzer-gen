    "intro": "Eupatorium flexile, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slight hairy texture. Eupatorium flexile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
