    "intro": "Euonymus linifolius, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in natural habitats."
