    "intro": "Euphorbia coderiana, commonly known as the Coder's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive appearance with a thick, woody stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early summer. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions."
