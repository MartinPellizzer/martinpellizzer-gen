    "intro": "Eurybia radula, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically silver-gray with a fuzzy texture, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Eurybia radula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
