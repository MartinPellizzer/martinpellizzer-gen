    "intro": "Eryngium spinalba, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features striking blue to purple spiked flowers surrounded by spiny, silver-green bracts. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in salty, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. Eryngium spinalba is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
