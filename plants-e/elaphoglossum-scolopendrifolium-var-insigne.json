    "intro": "Elaphoglossum scolopendrifolium var. insigne, commonly known as the noble maidenhair fern, is a variant of the scolopendrifolium form of Elaphoglossum, a genus of ferns native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant its distinctive, refined look."
