    "intro": "Euonymus darrisii, commonly known as the Chinese burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. Euonymus darrisii is relatively easy to grow and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
