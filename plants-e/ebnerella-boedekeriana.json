It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Ebnerella boedekeriana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
