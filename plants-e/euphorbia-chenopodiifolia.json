    "intro": "Euphorbia chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a branched stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
