    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the cider gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the crossbreeding of various eucalyptus species. It is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and smooth, often peeling bark that can range in color from white to grey. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib and a waxy coating. This species produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Eucalyptus \u00d7 hybrida is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in the production of essential oils."
