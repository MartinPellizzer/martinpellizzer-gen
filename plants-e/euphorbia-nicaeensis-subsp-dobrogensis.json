    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp. dobrogensis, commonly known as the Dobrogian euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, spiny stems that store water, adapting it to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
