    "intro": "Eragrostis glandulosa, commonly known as glandular lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent glandular structures along the leaf sheaths. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas. Eragrostis glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
