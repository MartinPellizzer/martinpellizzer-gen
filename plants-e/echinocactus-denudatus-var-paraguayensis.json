It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant features a ribbed stem that can reach up to 30 cm in height, with a grayish-green color and a rough, textured surface. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles, and it is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions.
