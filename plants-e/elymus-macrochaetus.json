    "intro": "Elymus macrochaetus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures containing the florets. Elymus macrochaetus is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
