    "intro": "Echinops kurdicus, commonly known as the Kurdish thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a defining feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Echinops kurdicus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for drought-resistant landscaping."
