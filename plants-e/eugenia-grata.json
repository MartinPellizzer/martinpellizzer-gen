    "intro": "Eugenia grata, commonly known as the wax apple or Java apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, with a waxy coating that gives it its common name. Eugenia grata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
