    "intro": "Eugenia trunciflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy taste. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
