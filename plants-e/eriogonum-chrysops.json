    "intro": "Eriogonum chrysops, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and sagebrush steppe. It has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eriogonum chrysops is an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
