    "intro": "Eucalyptus angulosa var. ceratocorys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its angular, often twisted branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which appear in late winter to early spring. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
