    "intro": "Erigeron rupicola, commonly known as the rock coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Erigeron rupicola is a hardy perennial that is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
