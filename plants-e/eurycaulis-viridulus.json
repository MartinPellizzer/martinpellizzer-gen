    "intro": "Eurycaulis viridulus, commonly known as the green-stemmed willow, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are typically covered in a fine, greenish pubescence. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas."
