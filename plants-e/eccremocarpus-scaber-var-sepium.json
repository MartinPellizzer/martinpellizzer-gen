    "intro": "Eccremocarpus scaber var. sepium, commonly known as the rough-sepium moonflower, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces striking, showy white to pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a distinctive, spiny capsule that splits open to release its seeds. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
