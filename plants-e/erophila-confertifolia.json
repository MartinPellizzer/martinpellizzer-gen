    "intro": "Erophila confertifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved erophila, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal or inland grassland habitats. The plant features opposite, linear to oblanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit."
