    "intro": "Euphorbia insularis, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, bottle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water retention, and its roots are shallow, enabling it to absorb moisture from the surface. Euphorbia insularis is a striking example of evolutionary adaptation to extreme desert conditions."
