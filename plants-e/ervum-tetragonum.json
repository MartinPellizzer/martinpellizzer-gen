It is a perennial legume characterized by its square-shaped stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Ervum tetragonum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
