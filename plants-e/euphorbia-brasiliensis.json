It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves, adapted to store water in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia brasiliensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
