    "intro": "Erica padibunda, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its dense foliage provides habitat for various insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. Erica padibunda is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
