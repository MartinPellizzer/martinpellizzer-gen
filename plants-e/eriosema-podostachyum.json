It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and it typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations and ecological interactions."
