    "intro": "Echinops karabachensis, commonly known as the Karabakh thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It produces yellow flowers in the summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, hard, spiky fruit. Echinops karabachensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
