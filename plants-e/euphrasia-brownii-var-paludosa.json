    "intro": "Euphrasia brownii var. paludosa, commonly known as bog gentian, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and swamps. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly toothed margin, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged conditions. This species plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying wetland ecosystems."
