    "intro": "Epidendrum acutissimum, commonly known as the sharp-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum acutissimum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
