    "intro": "Eriogonum nodosum var. jaegeri, commonly known as Jaeger's jointweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated margins, and its roots are adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This variety is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for pollinators and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
