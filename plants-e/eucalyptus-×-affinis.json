    "intro": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus crebra. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrubs with smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a blue-green coloration, and they are covered in a fine, white bloom. This species is native to southern Australia, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands. Eucalyptus \u00d7 affinis is well adapted to arid conditions and is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil quality."
