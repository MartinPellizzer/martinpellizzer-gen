    "intro": "Euphorbia lenensis, commonly known as the Lenensian spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with a branching structure that allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Euphorbia lenensis is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
