    "intro": "Eremophila castelli-arminii, commonly known as the Westringia lily, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Eremophila castelli-arminii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
