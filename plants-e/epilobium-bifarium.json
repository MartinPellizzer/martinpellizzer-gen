    "intro": "Epilobium bifarium, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow-herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, characterized by its showy, often pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. It has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Epilobium bifarium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
