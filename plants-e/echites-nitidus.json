    "intro": "Echites nitidus, commonly known as the smooth echites, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
