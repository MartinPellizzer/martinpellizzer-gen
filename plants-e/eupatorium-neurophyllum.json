It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, rich soils. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. Eupatorium neurophyllum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
