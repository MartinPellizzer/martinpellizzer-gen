    "intro": "Euphorbia arabicoides, commonly known as the Arabian spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features a low-growing, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735 (flowers) surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia arabicoides is adapted to thrive in hot, sunny conditions with minimal rainfall."
