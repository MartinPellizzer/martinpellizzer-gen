    "intro": "Epidendrum bicameratum, commonly known as the two-chambered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Epidendrum bicameratum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media."
