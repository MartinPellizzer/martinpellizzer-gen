    "intro": "Endomallus spirei, commonly known as the Spire's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated flowers that typically feature a combination of white and yellow petals. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found clinging to tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Endomallus spirei is considered a threatened species in its native range."
