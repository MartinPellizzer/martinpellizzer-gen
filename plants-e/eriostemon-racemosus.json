    "intro": "Eriostemon racemosus, commonly known as the coastal woad, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to saline and well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Eriostemon racemosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
