    "intro": "Encyclia conchaechila, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It features a pseudobulb with a single, fleshy leaf and produces showy, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
