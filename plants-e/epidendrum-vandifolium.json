    "intro": "Epidendrum vandifolium, commonly known as the Vandifolium Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that are typically borne on long, pendulous inflorescences. The plant has strap-like leaves that are usually narrow and elongated, adapting to its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit. It thrives in warm, humid environments with good air circulation and indirect light. Epidendrum vandifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
