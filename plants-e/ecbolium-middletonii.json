    "intro": "Ecbolium middletonii, commonly known as the Middleton's ecbolium, is a rare and endangered plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native environment."
