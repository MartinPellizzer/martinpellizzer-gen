    "intro": "Euphorbia brevirama var. astrophora, commonly known as the starry euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, spiny leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. It produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
