    "intro": "Eria deliana, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Eria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, meaning it thrives on trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Eria deliana is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
