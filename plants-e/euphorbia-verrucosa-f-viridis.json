    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa f. viridis, commonly known as the green\u75a3\u75ae\u690d\u7269, is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is noted for its unique green coloration, which distinguishes it from the typical greenish-yellow hues of other euphorbias. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, a feature common in the genus. Due to its succulent nature, it is adapted to survive in dry environments with minimal water requirements."
