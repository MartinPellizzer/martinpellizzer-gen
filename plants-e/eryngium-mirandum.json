    "intro": "Eryngium mirandum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spiky inflorescence that resembles a crown of thorns, with blue-violet bracts that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Eryngium mirandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unusual appearance."
