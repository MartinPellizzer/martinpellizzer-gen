    "intro": "Espeletia restricta, commonly known as the \"P\u00e1ramo flower,\" is a unique plant native to the Andean p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate strong winds and low temperatures. Espeletia restricta plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing the soil in fragile mountainous regions."
