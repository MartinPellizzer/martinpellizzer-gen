    "intro": "Exallage angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf exallage, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
