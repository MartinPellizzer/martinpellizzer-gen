    "intro": "Encephalartos schaijesii, commonly known as the Schaijes' cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of dense, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
