    "intro": "Elaphoglossum serpentinum, commonly known as the serpent's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many fern species. Elaphoglossum serpentinum is notable for its ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often found on serpentine rock outcrops, which gives it its common name."
