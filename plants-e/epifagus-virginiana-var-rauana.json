    "intro": "Epifagus virginiana var. rauana, commonly known as the red spruce, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, oval leaves that are typically reddish-brown on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. This species plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
