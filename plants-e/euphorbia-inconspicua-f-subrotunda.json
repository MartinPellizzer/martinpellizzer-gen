    "intro": "Euphorbia inconspicua f. subrotunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and slightly ribbed, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
