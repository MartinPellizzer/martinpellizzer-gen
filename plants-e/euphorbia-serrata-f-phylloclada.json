    "intro": "Euphorbia serrata f. phylloclada, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that are often mistaken for leaves, a feature typical of many euphorbias. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on short peduncles. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
