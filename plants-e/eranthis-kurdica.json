    "intro": "Eranthis kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Middle East. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Eranthis kurdica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
