    "intro": "Euterpe roseospadix, commonly known as the pink spadix palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Amazon rainforest and is characterized by its striking pink spadix, which is a central spike of tiny flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows as a medium-sized palm, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with a slender trunk and pinnate leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
