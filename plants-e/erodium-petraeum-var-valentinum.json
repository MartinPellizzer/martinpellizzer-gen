It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and rocky outcrops. Due to its delicate appearance and brief flowering period, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
