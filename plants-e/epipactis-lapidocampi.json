    "intro": "Epipactis lapidocampi, commonly known as the stone orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky or calcareous soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats. Its morphology includes a short, erect stem with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinct lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
