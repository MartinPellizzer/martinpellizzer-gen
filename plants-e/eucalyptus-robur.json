    "intro": "Eucalyptus robur, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a tall, hardy tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in strips, revealing a rough, fibrous inner layer. The tree produces aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a bluish-green hue. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are clustered in inflorescences, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus robur is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
