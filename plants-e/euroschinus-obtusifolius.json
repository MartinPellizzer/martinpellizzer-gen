It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in complex inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it may be toxic to livestock."
