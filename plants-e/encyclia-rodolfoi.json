    "intro": "Encyclia rodolfoi, commonly known as the Rodolfo's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Brazil. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with elongated petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia rodolfoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
