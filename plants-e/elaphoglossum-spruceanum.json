    "intro": "Elaphoglossum spruceanum, commonly known as the Spruce's hartschafer, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountainous areas. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
