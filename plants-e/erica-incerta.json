    "intro": "Erica incerta, commonly known as the uncertain heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica incerta is a low-growing shrub, often forming dense mats, and is well adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
