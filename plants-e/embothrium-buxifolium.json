    "intro": "Embothrium buxifolium, commonly known as the waxleaf embothrium, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates. Embothrium buxifolium is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its tolerance to partial shade."
