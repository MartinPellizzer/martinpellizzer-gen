The plant is known for its long-lasting blooms, which remain intact for extended periods, making it popular in floral arrangements. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Elleanthus tovarensis thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
