    "intro": "Ericoides glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving the plant its sticky appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Ericoides glandulosum thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
