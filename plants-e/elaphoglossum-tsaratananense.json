    "intro": "Elaphoglossum tsaratananense, commonly known as the Tsaratanana holly fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum tsaratananense is noted for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
