    "intro": "Epilobium tetragonum var. lucidum, commonly known as glossy willowherb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often covered in a waxy, shiny cuticle, giving it a distinctive glossy appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a common weed and an important component of wetland ecosystems."
