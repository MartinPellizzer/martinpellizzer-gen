    "intro": "Equisetum pratense var. ramulosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scouring rush, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its more slender and less branched stems compared to other equisetum species."
