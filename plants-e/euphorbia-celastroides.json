    "intro": "Euphorbia celastroides, commonly known as the coral tree or red torch, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-like inflorescences that appear in spring, consisting of clusters of tiny yellow flowers surrounded by red bracts. The plant has a thick, succulent stem with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Euphorbia celastroides is adapted to warm, dry climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its striking floral display."
