    "intro": "Eriophorum aquatile, commonly known as the water cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, typically found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Eriophorum aquatile plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various small organisms."
