    "intro": "Erophila patula, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in dry environments."
