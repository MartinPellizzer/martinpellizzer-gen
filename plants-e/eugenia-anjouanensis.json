    "intro": "Eugenia anjouanensis, commonly known as the Comoro ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Anjouan in the Comoros archipelago. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, black berries that are highly valued for their aromatic properties. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
