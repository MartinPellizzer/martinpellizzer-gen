    "intro": "Euphorbia immersa, commonly known as the submerged spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
