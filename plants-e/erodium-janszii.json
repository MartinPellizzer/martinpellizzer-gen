    "intro": "Erodium janszii, commonly known as the Janszii bedstraw, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
