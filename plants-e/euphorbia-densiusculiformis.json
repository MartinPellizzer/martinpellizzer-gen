It features a short, woody stem covered in dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. It produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia densiusculiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
