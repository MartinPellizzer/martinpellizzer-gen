    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its narrow, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum hirtipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
