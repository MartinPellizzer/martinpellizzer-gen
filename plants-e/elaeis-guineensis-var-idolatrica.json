    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis var. idolatrica, commonly known as the sacred oil palm, is a variant of the oil palm native to tropical regions of Africa. This plant is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the fruit, which is typically orange or yellow when ripe, contains a rich source of oil. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic traits and its role in traditional and modern agricultural practices."
