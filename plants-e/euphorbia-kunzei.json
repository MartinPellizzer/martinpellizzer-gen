    "intro": "Euphorbia kunzei, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces unique yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution. Euphorbia kunzei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
