    "intro": "Eriocaulon plantagineum, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typical of many grasses. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
