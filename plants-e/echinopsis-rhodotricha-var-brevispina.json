    "intro": "Echinopsis rhodotricha var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined moon cactus, is a succulent native to South America. It features a short, columnar stem with a distinctive red or pink coloration, often resembling a moon due to its shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It has spiny, cylindrical stems that are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in cactus gardens and as a houseplant."
