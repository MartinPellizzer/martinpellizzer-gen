    "intro": "Evaiezoa hieraciifolia, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of trees. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish or brownish, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
