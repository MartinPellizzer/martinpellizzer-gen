    "intro": "Eulophia aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The orchid's botanical structure includes a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in varying environmental conditions."
