    "intro": "Enceliopsis nudicaulis var. corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled dwarf desert dandelion, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and a short, thick stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a spherical, yellow composite flower that blooms in early spring. Its leaves are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant is adapted to arid environments with deep roots for water absorption. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
