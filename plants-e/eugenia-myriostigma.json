    "intro": "Eugenia myriostigma, commonly known as the broad-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, bright red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens."
