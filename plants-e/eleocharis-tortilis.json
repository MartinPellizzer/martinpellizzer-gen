    "intro": "Eleocharis tortilis, commonly known as the twisted spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that appears to twist or curl, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in a tight spiral, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Eleocharis tortilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
