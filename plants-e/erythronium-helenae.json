    "intro": "Erythronium helenae, commonly known as Helen's dog's mercury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, nodding, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a basal rosette, and it produces small, oval berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Erythronium helenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
