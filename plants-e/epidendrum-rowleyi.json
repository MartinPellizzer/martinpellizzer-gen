    "intro": "Epidendrum rowleyi, commonly known as the Rowley's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that can range from yellow to red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, adapted for efficient water absorption. Epidendrum rowleyi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
