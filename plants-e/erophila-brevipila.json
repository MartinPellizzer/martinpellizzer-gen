    "intro": "Erophila brevipila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, whorled leaves that are short and narrow, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Erophila brevipila plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
