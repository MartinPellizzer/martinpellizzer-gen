    "intro": "Ericoides pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Its flowers, typically pink or white, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ericoides pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
