It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as stream banks and meadows. Its stems are often reddish and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Epilobium opacum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
