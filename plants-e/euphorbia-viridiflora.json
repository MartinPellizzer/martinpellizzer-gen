    "intro": "Euphorbia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Euphorbia viridiflora is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
