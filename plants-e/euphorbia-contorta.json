    "intro": "Euphorbia contorta, commonly known as the twisted spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted stems that often form dense, bushy growth. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. Euphorbia contorta is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
