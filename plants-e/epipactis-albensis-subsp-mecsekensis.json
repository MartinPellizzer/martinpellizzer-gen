    "intro": "Epipactis albensis subsp. mecsekensis, commonly known as the Mecsek white helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the Mecsek Mountains in Hungary. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by a rhizome and a rosette of leaves. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with pale green to white flowers that have a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
