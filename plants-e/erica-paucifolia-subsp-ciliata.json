    "intro": "Erica paucifolia subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces clusters of tiny, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica paucifolia subsp. ciliata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
