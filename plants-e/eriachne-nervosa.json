    "intro": "Eriachne nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal dunes. Eriachne nervosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
