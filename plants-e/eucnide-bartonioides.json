    "intro": "Eucnide bartonioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, fragrant foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in woodworking, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
