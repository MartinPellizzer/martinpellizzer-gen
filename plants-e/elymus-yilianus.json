    "intro": "Elymus yilianus, commonly known as the Yili wild rye, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia, including regions of China and Kazakhstan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Elymus yilianus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
