    "intro": "Eranthemum lycioides, commonly known as the scarlet sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Eranthemum lycioides is adapted to survive in harsh climates, making it a resilient species in its native range."
