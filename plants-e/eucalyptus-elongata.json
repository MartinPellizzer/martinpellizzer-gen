    "intro": "Eucalyptus elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its bark is often flaky and greyish, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Eucalyptus elongata is an important component of mallee ecosystems and provides habitat for various native wildlife species."
