    "intro": "Espeletia lucida, commonly known as the \"snowy tree\" or \"white tree,\" is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, woolly foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it forms dense, shrub-like structures. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate the plant and reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Espeletia lucida is known for its showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
