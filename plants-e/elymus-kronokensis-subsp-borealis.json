    "intro": "Elymus kronokensis subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically blue-green in color, and it blooms in late summer. It thrives in cold, harsh environments, including tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is an important component of polar ecosystems."
