It is characterized by its distinctive branching structure, resembling a candlestick, with thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbellate clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid conditions and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an endangered species."
