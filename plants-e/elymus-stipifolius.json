    "intro": "Elymus stipifolius, commonly known as stiffleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. Elymus stipifolius is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and high-altitude conditions. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
