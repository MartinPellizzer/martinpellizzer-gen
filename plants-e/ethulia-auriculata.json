    "intro": "Ethulia auriculata, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
