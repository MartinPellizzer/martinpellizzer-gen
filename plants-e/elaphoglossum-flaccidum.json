    "intro": "Elaphoglossum flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum flaccidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
