    "intro": "Empetrum purpureum, commonly known as the red mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, dark red berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or barren areas. Empetrum purpureum plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and small mammals."
