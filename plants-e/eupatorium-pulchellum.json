    "intro": "Eupatorium pulchellum, commonly known as white boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems covered in fine hairs and produces clusters of small, white, button-like flowers. The plant has serrated, opposite leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. White boneset is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
