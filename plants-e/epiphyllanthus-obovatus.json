    "intro": "Epiphyllanthus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate epiphyllanthus, is a rare and intriguing plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features broad, ovate-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
