    "intro": "Elaeagnus triflora subsp. tetragonia, commonly known as the four-leaf silverberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery foliage, which results from dense, glandular hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility."
