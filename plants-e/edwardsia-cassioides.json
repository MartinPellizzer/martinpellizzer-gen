It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Edwardsia cassioides is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and sandy habitats."
