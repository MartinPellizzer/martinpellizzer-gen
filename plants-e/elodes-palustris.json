    "intro": "Elodes palustris, commonly known as the marsh elodea, is a freshwater aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged in water. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that emerge above the water surface, followed by dark, spherical fruits. Elodes palustris is often found in still or slow-moving waters such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
