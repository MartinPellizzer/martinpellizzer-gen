    "intro": "Edwardia caricifolia, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
