    "intro": "Encyclia caicensis, commonly known as the Cape Verde orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Cape Verde Islands. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires moderate to bright light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
