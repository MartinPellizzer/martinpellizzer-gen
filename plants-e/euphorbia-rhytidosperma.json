    "intro": "Euphorbia rhytidosperma, commonly known as the desert euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, further adapting to its harsh environment. Euphorbia rhytidosperma is well-suited for xerophytic gardens due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
