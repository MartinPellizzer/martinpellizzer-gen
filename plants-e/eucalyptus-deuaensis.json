    "intro": "Eucalyptus deuaensis, commonly known as the Deua River gum, is a small to medium-sized eucalyptus native to the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales, Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands. The tree has smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, followed by small, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and adaptation to its specific habitat."
