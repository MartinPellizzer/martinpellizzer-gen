    "intro": "Eupatorium cordifolium, commonly known as heart-leaved thoroughwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Its botanical name reflects its heart-shaped foliage, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
