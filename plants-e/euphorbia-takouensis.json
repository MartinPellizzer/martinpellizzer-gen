    "intro": "Euphorbia takouensis, commonly known as the Takou spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of western Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, further adapting it to minimize water loss. Euphorbia takouensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
