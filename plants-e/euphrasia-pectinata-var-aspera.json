    "intro": "Euphrasia pectinata var. aspera, commonly known as rough milkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, often with a slightly waxy coating. This variety is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland areas."
