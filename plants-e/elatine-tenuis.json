It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters such as ponds and ditches. Elatine tenuis is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
