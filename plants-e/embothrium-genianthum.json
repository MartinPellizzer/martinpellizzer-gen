It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it has a rapid growth rate, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting. Embothrium genianthum is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal and arid environments."
