    "intro": "Echinopsis ancistrophora, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, red spines and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissue. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and limited rainfall. Its structure and growth patterns make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
