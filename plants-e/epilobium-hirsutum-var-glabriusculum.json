    "intro": "Epilobium hirsutum var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the smooth willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and wet meadows. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabriusculum has reduced hair compared to the typical form. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
