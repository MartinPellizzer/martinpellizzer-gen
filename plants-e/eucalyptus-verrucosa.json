    "intro": "Eucalyptus verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
