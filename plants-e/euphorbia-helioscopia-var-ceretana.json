    "intro": "Euphorbia helioscopia var. ceretana, commonly known as the sun spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in gardens and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a nuisance and a resilient plant in various habitats."
