    "intro": "Epicladium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the canopy of forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
