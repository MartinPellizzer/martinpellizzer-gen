    "intro": "Eriophorum russeolum var. albidum, commonly known as the white tussock sedge, is a variant of the tussock sedge species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, whitish to silver-gray inflorescence, which distinguishes it from the more commonly seen green or brown forms of the species. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs, fens, and marshes, where it forms tussocks due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine, soft hairs. This plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
