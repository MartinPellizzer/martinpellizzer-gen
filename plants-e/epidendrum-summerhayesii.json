    "intro": "Epidendrum summerhayesii, commonly known as the Summerhayes' Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive, making it a popular choice for intermediate orchid growers."
