It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It features narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
