    "intro": "Equisetum nodosum, commonly known as the scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems covered in small, spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has whorls of small, scale-like structures called enations. Equisetum nodosum is typically found in wet, acidic soils and is often associated with disturbed or nutrient-poor environments. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution."
