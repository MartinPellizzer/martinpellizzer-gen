    "intro": "Eucalyptus decorticans, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pale yellow or cream, and are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
