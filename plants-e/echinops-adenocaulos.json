    "intro": "Echinops adenocaulos, commonly known as the blue glassweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spherical blue-gray seed heads that resemble small globes, which become more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant has a basal rosette of silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive seed heads. Echinops adenocaulos is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
