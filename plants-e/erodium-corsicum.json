    "intro": "Erodium corsicum, commonly known as Corsican bird's-beak, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to purple in color, with five petals that curve inward, resembling a bird's beak. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across rocky and disturbed soils."
