    "intro": "Elynanthus gracilis, commonly known as slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are pollinated primarily by insects. Elynanthus gracilis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
