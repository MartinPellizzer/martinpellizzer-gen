It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey. The plant produces small, globular white flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. This subspecies is an important component of the coastal vegetation in its native range."
