    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 jesupii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often found in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread."
