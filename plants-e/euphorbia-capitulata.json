    "intro": "Euphorbia capitulata, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or crown-of-thorns euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which give it its distinctive appearance. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to touch or ingest. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and unique visual characteristics."
