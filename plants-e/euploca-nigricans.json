    "intro": "Euploca nigricans, commonly known as the black euploca, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Euploca nigricans is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
