    "intro": "Eriocaulon minusculum, commonly known as the minute bulbous sedge, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat. Eriocaulon minusculum is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it contributes to the ecological stability of these ecosystems."
