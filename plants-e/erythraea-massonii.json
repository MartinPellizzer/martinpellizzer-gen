    "intro": "Erythraea massonii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are often fragrant, and its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and glossy. Erythraea massonii is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
