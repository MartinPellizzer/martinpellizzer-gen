    "intro": "Euonymus japonicus var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal euonymus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Japan. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
