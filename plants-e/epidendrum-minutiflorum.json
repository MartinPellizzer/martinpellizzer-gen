    "intro": "Epidendrum minutiflorum, commonly known as the miniature flower orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often appearing in clusters. The plant has strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
