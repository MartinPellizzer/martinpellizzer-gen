    "intro": "Epidendrum macrobulbon, commonly known as the giant green orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy leaves and showy, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Epidendrum macrobulbon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
