    "intro": "Euphorbia porphyrastra, commonly known as the purple-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically purple or reddish in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia porphyrastra is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
