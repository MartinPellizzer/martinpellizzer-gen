It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible but often have a sour taste. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its dense foliage and showy blooms. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
