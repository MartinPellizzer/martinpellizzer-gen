    "intro": "Exocarpos phyllanthoides, commonly known as the African starfruit or wild starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common starfruit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in warm, sunny environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit, which is edible when ripe, contains a juicy, segmented pulp surrounded by a thin, membranous pericarp."
