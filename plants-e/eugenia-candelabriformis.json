    "intro": "Eugenia candelabriformis, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its foliage is thick and glossy, providing dense shade, making it suitable for ornamental use in warm climates. Eugenia candelabriformis is also valued for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
