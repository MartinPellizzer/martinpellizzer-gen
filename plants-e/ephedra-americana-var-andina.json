    "intro": "Ephedra americana var. andina, commonly known as the Andean ephedra, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to high-altitude, arid environments. It contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is now regulated in many regions."
