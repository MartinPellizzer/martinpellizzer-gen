    "intro": "Epiphyllum caudatum, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its flat, segmented stems that are often adorned with vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. It blooms during the holiday season, hence its common name, and requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Epiphyllum caudatum is popular as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
