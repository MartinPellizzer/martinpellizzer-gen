    "intro": "Elatostema stoloniforme, commonly known as the creeping Elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Elatostema stoloniforme is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
