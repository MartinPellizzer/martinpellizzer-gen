    "intro": "Eupatorium pectinatum, commonly known as roughhead thoroughwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist woodland areas and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features opposite, rough-textured leaves with serrated edges, and its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. It blooms from late summer to early autumn, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
