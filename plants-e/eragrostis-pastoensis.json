    "intro": "Eragrostis pastoensis, commonly known as Pasto grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often growing in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential for ecological restoration, Eragrostis pastoensis is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
