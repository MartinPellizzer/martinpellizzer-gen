    "intro": "Evolvulus chamaepitys var. caespitosus, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields, and is adapted to arid environments."
