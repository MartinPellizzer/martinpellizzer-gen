    "intro": "Euphorbia splendens var. breonii, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often spiny, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
