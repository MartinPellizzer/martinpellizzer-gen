    "intro": "Eriophorum cyperinum var. condensatum, commonly known as the dense tussock sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and fens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
