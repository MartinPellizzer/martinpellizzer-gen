    "intro": "Eryngium pendletonense, commonly known as Pendleton's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across arid regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
