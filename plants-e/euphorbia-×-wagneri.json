It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscaping."
