    "intro": "Euphorbia neoreflexa, commonly known as the reflexed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves. Euphorbia neoreflexa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
