    "intro": "Euphorbia benguelensis, commonly known as the Benguela euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It features a thick, woody stem with a greyish-green color and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has modified leaves that serve as spines, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Euphorbia benguelensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
