    "intro": "Epipactis viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces a tall, erect stem bearing a single spike of greenish-yellow flowers, which are notable for their intricate structure and lack of a typical orchid labellum. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Epipactis viridiflora is an important species for pollinators and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi."
