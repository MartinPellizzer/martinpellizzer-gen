    "intro": "Eucalyptus socialis subsp. viridans, commonly known as the green eucalyptus, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that can range from white to grey in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue, which contributes to its common name. The flowers are small and clustered, usually in groups of three, and are typically white or pale yellow. This subspecies is often found in open forests and woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
