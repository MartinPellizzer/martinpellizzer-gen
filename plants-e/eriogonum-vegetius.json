    "intro": "Eriogonum vegetius, commonly known as the Sierra foothill buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to California and Nevada. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is part of the Polygonaceae family. Eriogonum vegetius is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
