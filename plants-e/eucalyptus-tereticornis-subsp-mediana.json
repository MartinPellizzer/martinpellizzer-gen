    "intro": "Eucalyptus tereticornis subsp. mediana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, clustered in umbels, and attract a variety of pollinators. This subspecies is adapted to a range of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. It is valued for its timber and has been used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
