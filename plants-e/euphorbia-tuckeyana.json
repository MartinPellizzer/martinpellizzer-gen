    "intro": "Euphorbia tuckeyana, commonly known as the Tuckey's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia tuckeyana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to harsh conditions."
