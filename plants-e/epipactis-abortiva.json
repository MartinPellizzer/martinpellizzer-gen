    "intro": "Epipactis abortiva, commonly known as the abortive helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded woodlands in Europe and parts of Asia. It produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and thrives in nutrient-rich, humusy soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
