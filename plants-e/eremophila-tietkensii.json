    "intro": "Eremophila tietkensii, commonly known as the Tietkens' erymophila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and spikes of pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in sandplains and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun. Eremophila tietkensii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
