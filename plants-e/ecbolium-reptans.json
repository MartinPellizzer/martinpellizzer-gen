    "intro": "Ecbolium reptans, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky soils in arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in unstable substrates. Ecbolium reptans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
