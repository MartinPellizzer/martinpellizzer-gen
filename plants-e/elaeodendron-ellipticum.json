    "intro": "Elaeodendron ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elaeodendron, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
