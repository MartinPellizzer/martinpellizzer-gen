    "intro": "Elynanthus laxus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Elynanthus laxus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators."
