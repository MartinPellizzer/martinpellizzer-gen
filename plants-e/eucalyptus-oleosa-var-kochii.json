It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous underneath. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and dry sclerophyll forests. Eucalyptus oleosa var. kochii is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
