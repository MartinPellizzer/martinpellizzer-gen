    "intro": "Epidendrum intertextum, commonly known as the Crimson Lip Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a fibrous sheath, while its leaves are elongated and grass-like. Epidendrum intertextum blooms during the summer months, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
