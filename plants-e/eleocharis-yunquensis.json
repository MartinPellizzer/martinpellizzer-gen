    "intro": "Eleocharis yunquensis, commonly known as the Yunqu sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan Province, where it grows in wetland and marshy environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and cylindrical, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eleocharis yunquensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
