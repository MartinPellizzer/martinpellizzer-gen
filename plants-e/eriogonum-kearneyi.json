    "intro": "Eriogonum kearneyi, commonly known as Kearney's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Eriogonum kearneyi plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
