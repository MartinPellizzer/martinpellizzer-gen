    "intro": "Erysimum pyrenaicum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Pyrenean wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers in early spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
