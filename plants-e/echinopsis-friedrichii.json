    "intro": "Echinopsis friedrichii, commonly known as the Friedrich's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night to attract specific pollinators. Echinopsis friedrichii is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
