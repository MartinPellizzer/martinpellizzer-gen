    "intro": "Euphorbia foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It features a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Euphorbia foetida is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It is also characterized by its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant."
