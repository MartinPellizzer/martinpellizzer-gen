    "intro": "Eulophia squalida, commonly known as the dirty orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Eulophia squalida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
