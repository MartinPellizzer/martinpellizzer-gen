    "intro": "Erica subterminalis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in coastal areas with sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are needle-like and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature. Erica subterminalis is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
