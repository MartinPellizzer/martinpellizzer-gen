    "intro": "Epistephium subrepens, commonly known as the creeping epistephium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface. Epistephium subrepens is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
