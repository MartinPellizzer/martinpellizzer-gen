    "intro": "Erysimum altaicum var. shinganicum, commonly known as the Shingana wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
