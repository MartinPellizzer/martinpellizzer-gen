    "intro": "Euphorbia coudercii, commonly known as the Congo buttercup, is a succulent plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
