    "intro": "Euphorbia elquiensis, commonly known as the Elqui euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and a distinctive crown of spiny, leaf-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can survive in poor soil conditions. Euphorbia elquiensis is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing the local ecosystem."
