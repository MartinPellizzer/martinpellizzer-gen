    "intro": "Eupatorium tubiflorum, commonly known as the swamp boneset, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged conditions. Eupatorium tubiflorum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
