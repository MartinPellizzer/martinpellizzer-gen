    "intro": "Echinocereus steereae, commonly known as the Steere's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its foliage is often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. This species is often grown in rock gardens or as a houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental value."
