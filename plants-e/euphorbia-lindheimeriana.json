    "intro": "Euphorbia lindheimeriana, commonly known as Lindheimer's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the southern United States. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves and stems contain a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
