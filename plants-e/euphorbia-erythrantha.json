    "intro": "Euphorbia erythrantha, commonly known as the red-veined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branching stem covered in soft, greenish-grayish leaves with distinctive red veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Euphorbia erythrantha is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
