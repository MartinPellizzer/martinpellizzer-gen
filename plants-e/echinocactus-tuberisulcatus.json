    "intro": "Echinocactus tuberisulcatus, commonly known as the Mexican horse chestnut, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Echinocactus tuberisulcatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
