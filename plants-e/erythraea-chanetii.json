    "intro": "Erythraea chanetii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and glossy in appearance. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing winged seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Erythraea chanetii is now classified as critically endangered."
