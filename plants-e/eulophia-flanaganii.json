    "intro": "Eulophia flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's eulophia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, elongated shape that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Eulophia flanaganii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
