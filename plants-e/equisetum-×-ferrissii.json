    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 ferrissii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum palustre. It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. It lacks true leaves and instead has whorls of small, spore-producing structures called strobila. Due to its inability to reproduce sexually, it spreads primarily through vegetative propagation."
