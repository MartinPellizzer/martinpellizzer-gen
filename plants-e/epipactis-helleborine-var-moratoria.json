    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. moratoria, commonly known as the northern helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its preference for calcareous soils. This orchid is also known for its mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake from the soil."
