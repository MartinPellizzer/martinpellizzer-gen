It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its jointed stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense clusters. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis costulata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
