    "intro": "Elytrigia bessarabica, commonly known as Bessarabian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes, grasslands, and rocky soils. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elytrigia bessarabica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native range."
