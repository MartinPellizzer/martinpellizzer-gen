    "intro": "Euphorbia phymatosperma subsp. cernua, commonly known as the drooping leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a low-growing, branching stem covered in thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive addition to desert gardens and rockeries."
