    "intro": "Echium megalanthum, commonly known as the giant blueweed, is a striking annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, adorned with clusters of vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Echium megalanthum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
