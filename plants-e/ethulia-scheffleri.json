    "intro": "Ethulia scheffleri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Ethulia scheffleri is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
