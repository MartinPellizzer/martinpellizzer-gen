    "intro": "Elymus trachycaulus subsp. subsecundus, commonly known as the rough false oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, awned spikelets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often forming dense tussocks on rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
