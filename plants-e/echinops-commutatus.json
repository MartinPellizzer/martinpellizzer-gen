It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is known for its spiny, spherical seed heads that are often used in ornamental gardening. Echinops commutatus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its structure and appearance make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and botanical appreciation."
