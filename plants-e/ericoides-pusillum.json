    "intro": "Ericoides pusillum, commonly known as the small heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. Its flowers are tiny, bell-shaped, and typically pink or purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. Ericoides pusillum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
