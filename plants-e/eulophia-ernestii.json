    "intro": "Eulophia ernestii, commonly known as the Ernest's eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like foliage and produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, with flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
