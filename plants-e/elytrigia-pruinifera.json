    "intro": "Elytrigia pruinifera, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Elytrigia pruinifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
