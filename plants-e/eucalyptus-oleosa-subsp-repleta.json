    "intro": "Eucalyptus oleosa subsp. repleta, commonly known as the broad-leaved mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periodic drought conditions. This subspecies is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
