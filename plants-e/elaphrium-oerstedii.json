    "intro": "Elaphrium oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's elaphrium, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of its family.
