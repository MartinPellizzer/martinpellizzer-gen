    "intro": "Eurya japonica f. leucobaccata, commonly known as the white-fruited eurya, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant seasonal color changes and compact growth habit. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for shaded garden spaces."
