    "intro": "Erysimum cheiranthoides var. aquaticum, commonly known as water wallflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are bright yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
