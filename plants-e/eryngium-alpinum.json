    "intro": "Eryngium alpinum, commonly known as alpine thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking blue to purple spiny flower heads surrounded by pale blue bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture and a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Eryngium alpinum is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
