    "intro": "Eriocarpum australe, commonly known as the coastal wrensara, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, hairy, woody fruits called eriocarps. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy conditions, making it a characteristic species of coastal ecosystems. Eriocarpum australe plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
