It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, which help minimize water loss. Euphorbia sarawschanica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
