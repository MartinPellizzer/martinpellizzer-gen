It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
