    "intro": "Eucalyptus utilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Western Australia and is characterized by its tall, multi-stemmed shrub or tree form. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine greyish pubescence. It produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters during the winter and spring seasons. The bark of Eucalyptus utilis is typically fibrous and peels off in strips, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
