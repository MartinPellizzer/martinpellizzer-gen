    "intro": "Echinops leucographus, commonly known as the white-rayed thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical stems and pale blue to white ray florets that contrast with its dark purple central disk. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure resembles other echinops species, but the distinctive white markings on its bracts set it apart. The plant produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh climates."
