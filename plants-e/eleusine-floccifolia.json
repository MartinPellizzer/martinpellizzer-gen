    "intro": "Eleusine floccifolia, commonly known as silky fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy appearance due to the fine, hair-like structures on its leaves and inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its inflorescence is a loose, open cluster of spikelets, which contribute to its ornamental value. Eleusine floccifolia is also used in some regions for forage or as a ground cover."
