    "intro": "Eugenia areolata, commonly known as the spotted eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical forests of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow spots. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, reddish-purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
