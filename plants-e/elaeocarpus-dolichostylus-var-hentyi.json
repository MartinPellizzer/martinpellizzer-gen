    "intro": "Elaeocarpus dolichostylus var. hentyi, commonly known as the Henty's elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and distinctive, elongated floral structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
