It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons. It is often found in open woodlands and along rocky outcrops. Eora baueri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
