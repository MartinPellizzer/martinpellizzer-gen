    "intro": "Eucalyptus urna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and small, narrow leaves that are usually grayish-green in color. Eucalyptus urna produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
