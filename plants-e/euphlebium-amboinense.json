    "intro": "Euphlebium amboinense, commonly known as the Amboina euphlebium, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the island of Ambon in Indonesia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique floral structures and milky sap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific microhabitats for survival. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
