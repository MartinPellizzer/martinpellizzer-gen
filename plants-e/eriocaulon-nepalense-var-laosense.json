    "intro": "Eriocaulon nepalense var. laosense, commonly known as the Laos hill marsh grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This variant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Laos and parts of Vietnam. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often growing in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
