It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and entire, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Euchroma integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
