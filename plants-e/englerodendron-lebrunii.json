    "intro": "Englerodendron lebrunii, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany or Cuban rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its straight, dark-colored heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its ornamental and commercial value, it is often cultivated in warm climates for both timber and garden use."
