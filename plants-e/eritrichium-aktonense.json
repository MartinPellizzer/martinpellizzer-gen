    "intro": "Eritrichium aktonense, commonly known as the Alaska ice plant, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and purple. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy stems and leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and tundra habitats. Eritrichium aktonense is adapted to extreme conditions, with a short growing season and specialized mechanisms for water conservation."
