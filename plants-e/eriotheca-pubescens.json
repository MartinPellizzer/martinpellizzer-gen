    "intro": "Eriotheca pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Eriotheca pubescens is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
