    "intro": "Euphorbia tholicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is a distinctive feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or rocky environments and is adapted to store water in its stems. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
