    "intro": "Echinochloa oryzoides subsp. oryzicola, commonly known as rice grass or rice fruittail, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetland areas, rice fields, and disturbed soils, making it an important weed in agricultural systems. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, hollow stems, and a distinctive seed structure that aids in its dispersal."
