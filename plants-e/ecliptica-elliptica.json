    "intro": "Ecliptica elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf eclipta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ecliptica elliptica is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
