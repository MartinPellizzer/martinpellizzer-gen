    "intro": "Ecbolium symphyanthum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its lack of chlorophyll. Its growth is highly dependent on the humidity and light conditions of its forest habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
