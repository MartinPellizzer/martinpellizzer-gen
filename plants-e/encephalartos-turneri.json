    "intro": "Encephalartos turneri, commonly known as the Knysna cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically growing at the base of the plant and female cones at the top. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
