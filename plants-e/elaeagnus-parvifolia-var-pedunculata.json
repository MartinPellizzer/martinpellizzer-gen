    "intro": "Elaeagnus parvifolia var. pedunculata, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid landscapes. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and turn reddish in the fall, adding seasonal interest."
