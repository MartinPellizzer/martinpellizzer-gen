    "intro": "Evelyna caravata, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Evelyna caravata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
