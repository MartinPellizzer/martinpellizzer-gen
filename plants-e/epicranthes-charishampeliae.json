    "intro": "Epicranthes charishampeliae, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in dense forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical researchers. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
