    "intro": "Eucalyptus kochii subsp. yellowdinensis, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The species produces small, globular flower buds that are usually yellow or yellow-green, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
