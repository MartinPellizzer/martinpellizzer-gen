    "intro": "Euphorbia neutra, commonly known as the Neutra spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with smooth, green, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia neutra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
