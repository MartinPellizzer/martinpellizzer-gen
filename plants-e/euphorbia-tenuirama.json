    "intro": "Euphorbia tenuirama, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with smooth, blue-green foliage that is often covered in a fine white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
