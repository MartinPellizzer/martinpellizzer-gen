    "intro": "Epidendrum linifolium, commonly known as the silver-leaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum linifolium is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
