    "intro": "Erodium trilobatum, commonly known as redstem filaree, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Americas. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Erodium trilobatum is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
