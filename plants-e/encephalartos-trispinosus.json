    "intro": "Encephalartos trispinosus, commonly known as the Three-spined cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
