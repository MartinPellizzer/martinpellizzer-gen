    "intro": "Eremostachys bamianica, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in extreme conditions. Eremostachys bamianica is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of resilience in high-altitude ecosystems."
