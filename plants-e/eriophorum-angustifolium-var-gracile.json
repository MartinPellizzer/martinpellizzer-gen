    "intro": "Eriophorum angustifolium var. gracile, commonly known as slender cotton grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton. This plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Its flowering occurs in late summer, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
