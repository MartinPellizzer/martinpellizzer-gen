    "intro": "Epidendrum mininocturnum, commonly known as the night-blooming epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
