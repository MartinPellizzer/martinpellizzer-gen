    "intro": "Eriogonum villiflorum var. typicum, commonly known as the Townsend's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects."
