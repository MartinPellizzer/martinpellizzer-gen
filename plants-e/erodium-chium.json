It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-colored pith that aids in seed dispersal. Erodium chium is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
