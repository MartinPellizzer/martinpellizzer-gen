    "intro": "Elymus reflexiaristatus subsp. strigosus, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy foliage. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in temperate regions. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the flowering stems, with lemmas that are often hairy and sometimes awned. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The species is notable for its adaptability to poor soils and its role in stabilizing erosion-prone areas."
