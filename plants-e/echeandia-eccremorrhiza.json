    "intro": "Echeandia eccremorrhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and narrow, elliptic leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Echeandia eccremorrhiza is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it thrives with minimal water and full sun exposure."
