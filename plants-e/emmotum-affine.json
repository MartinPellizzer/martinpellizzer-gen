    "intro": "Emmotum affine, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often toothed along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels during late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature. Emmotum affine is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive fall color and adaptability to various soil types."
