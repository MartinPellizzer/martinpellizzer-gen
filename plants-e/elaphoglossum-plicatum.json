    "intro": "Elaphoglossum plicatum, commonly known as the pleated holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a pleated or folded appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
