    "intro": "Epidendrum monticola, commonly known as the mountain epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, arranged in racemes along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum monticola is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
