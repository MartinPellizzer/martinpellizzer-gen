    "intro": "Eremophila hispida, commonly known as the rough eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting nectar-feeding insects and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Eremophila hispida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
