    "intro": "Euphorbia macroceras var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a caudex, which is a thickened stem base, and produces striking yellow flowers in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of succulents. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
