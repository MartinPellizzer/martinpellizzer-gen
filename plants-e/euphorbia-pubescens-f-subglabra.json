    "intro": "Euphorbia pubescens f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a variant of the euphorbia species characterized by its reduced pubescence. It is a succulent plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a caudex with multiple branches, and its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
