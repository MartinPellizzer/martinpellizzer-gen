    "intro": "Eriogonum corymbosum var. thompsoniae, commonly known as Thompson's stickybush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to greenish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
