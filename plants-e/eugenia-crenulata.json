    "intro": "Eugenia crenulata, commonly known as the waxleaf eugenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, waxy leaves that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, it is a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical gardens."
