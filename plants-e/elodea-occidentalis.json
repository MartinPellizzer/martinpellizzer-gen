    "intro": "Elodea occidentalis, commonly known as western water plantain, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has long, slender stems that are often branched and bear small, whorled leaves. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are typically found in clusters at the water's surface. Its roots help stabilize sediment and improve water quality by absorbing nutrients. Elodea occidentalis is often used in aquariums and as a food source for aquatic herbivores."
