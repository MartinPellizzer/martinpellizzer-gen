    "intro": "Epilobium denticulatum var. confertum, commonly known as the broad-leaved willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, hairy leaves and showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, roadsides, and wet meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsules as its fruit, containing numerous small seeds. This species is often considered an invasive plant in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
