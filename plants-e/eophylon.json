    "intro": "Eophylon, commonly known as the \"ancient sea lichen,\" is an extinct genus of early complex multicellular organisms. It is considered one of the earliest known examples of a complex, multicellular structure in the fossil record. Eophylon fossils are typically found in Cambrian strata, suggesting they lived over 500 million years ago. These organisms had a branching, filamentous structure with distinct layers of cells, indicating some level of differentiation. Their botanical significance lies in their role as a precursor to more complex life forms, providing insights into early evolutionary developments."
