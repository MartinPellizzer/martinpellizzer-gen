    "intro": "Equisetum fluviatile var. brachycladon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water horsetail, is a variant of the water horsetail characterized by its slender, whorled leaves. It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a distinct appearance with a central stem and branches that bear small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores and is known for its ability to thrive in water-saturated environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions."
