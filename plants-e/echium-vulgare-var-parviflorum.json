    "intro": "Echium vulgare var. parviflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered thornweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a tall, spiny stem that bears clusters of tiny flowers. This variety is less common than the typical Echium vulgare and is often found in dry, open habitats."
