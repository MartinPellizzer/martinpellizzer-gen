    "intro": "Euonymus verrucosus f. parvifolius, commonly known as the dwarf euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. The plant is native to eastern Asia and thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. It has a slow growth rate and is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens due to its dense foliage. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal color changes, though it is not typically cultivated for its flowers."
