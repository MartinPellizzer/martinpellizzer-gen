    "intro": "Evelyna hallii, commonly known as the Hall's evening orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant, nocturnal blooms that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and requires cool, moist conditions to thrive. Its unique pollination strategy involves specific nocturnal pollinators, making it an important subject in ecological studies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Evelyna hallii is considered endangered and is the focus of conservation efforts."
