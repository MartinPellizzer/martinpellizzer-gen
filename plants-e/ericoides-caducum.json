    "intro": "Ericoides caducum, commonly known as the deciduous ericoid, is a shrub characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that shed seasonally. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland or rocky environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation. Ericoides caducum plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats."
