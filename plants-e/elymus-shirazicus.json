    "intro": "Elymus shirazicus, commonly known as Shiraz grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle structure. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Elymus shirazicus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
