    "intro": "Elaeis guineensis f. semidura, commonly known as the semi-dura palm, is a botanical variant of the oil palm. It is characterized by its unique fruit structure, which differs from the typical oil palm in terms of fruit size and oil content. The plant is native to West Africa and is adapted to tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Its semi-dura trait refers to the texture and composition of its fruits, making it distinct from other Elaeis species. This variant is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in sustainable oil production."
