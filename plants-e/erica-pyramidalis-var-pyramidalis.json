    "intro": "Erica pyramidalis var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This hardy plant is well suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance."
