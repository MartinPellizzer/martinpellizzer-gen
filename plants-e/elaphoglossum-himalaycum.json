    "intro": "Elaphoglossum himalaycum, commonly known as the Himalayan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Elaphoglossum himalaycum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
