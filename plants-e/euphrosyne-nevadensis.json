    "intro": "Euphrosyne nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada euphrosyne, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its alpine habitat. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euphrosyne nevadensis is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-elevation ecosystems."
