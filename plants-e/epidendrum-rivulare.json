    "intro": "Epidendrum rivulare, commonly known as the river epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, which is essential for its survival in humid tropical environments. Epidendrum rivulare is valued both for its ornamental beauty and for its ecological role in supporting various insect pollinators."
