It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. This variant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a unique texture compared to the typical form of Erigeron acris. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. The plant produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
