    "intro": "Echium maritimum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and cliffs. Echium maritimum plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
