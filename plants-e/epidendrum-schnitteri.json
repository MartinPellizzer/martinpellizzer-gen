    "intro": "Epidendrum schnitteri, commonly known as the Schmitter's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum schnitteri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
