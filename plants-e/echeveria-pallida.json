    "intro": "Echeveria pallida, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
