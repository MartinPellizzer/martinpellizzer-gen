    "intro": "Euonymus pashanensis, commonly known as the Himalayan spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. Euonymus pashanensis is often found in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes."
