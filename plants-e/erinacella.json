    "intro": "Erinacella, commonly known as the ghost fungus, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. These fungi are characterized by their pale, often ghostly appearance, which gives them their common name. They are typically found in decaying wood, where they play a role in the decomposition process. Erinacella species are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants. Their unique morphology and ecological role make them an intriguing subject in mycology."
