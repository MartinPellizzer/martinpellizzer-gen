It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
