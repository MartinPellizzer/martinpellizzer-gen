    "intro": "Euphorbia longinsulicola, commonly known as the Socotra candelabra, is a unique succulent native to the Socotra archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive branching structure, resembling a candlestick, with thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
