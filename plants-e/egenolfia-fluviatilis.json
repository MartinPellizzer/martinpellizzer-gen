It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as rivers and lakes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late summer. Egenolfia fluviatilis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
