    "intro": "Erigeron alaskanus, commonly known as the Alaska fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats. The plant features daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Erigeron alaskanus plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native ecosystems."
