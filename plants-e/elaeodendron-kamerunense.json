It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
