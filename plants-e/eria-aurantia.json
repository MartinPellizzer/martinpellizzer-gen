    "intro": "Eria aurantia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are often clustered in racemes and emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
