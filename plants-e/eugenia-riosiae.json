    "intro": "Eugenia riosiae, commonly known as the Riosia guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit, a small, round berry, is edible and has a sweet, citrusy flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eugenia riosiae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
