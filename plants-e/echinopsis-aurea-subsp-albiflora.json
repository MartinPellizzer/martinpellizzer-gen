    "intro": "Echinopsis aurea subsp. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered moon cactus, is a succulent native to South America, particularly Argentina. It features a swollen, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically absent, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic structure. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
