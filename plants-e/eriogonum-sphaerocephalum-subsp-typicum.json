    "intro": "Eriogonum sphaerocephalum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the globular buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescence that resembles a small globe, composed of numerous small, pinkish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
