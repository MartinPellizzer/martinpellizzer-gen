    "intro": "Epacris obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved epacris, is an evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of tubular flowers that range in color from pink to mauve. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in heathlands and open forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Epacris obtusifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
