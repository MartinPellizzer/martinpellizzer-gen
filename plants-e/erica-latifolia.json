    "intro": "Erica latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to the harsh, coastal conditions it inhabits. Erica latifolia is well-suited to poor, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation."
