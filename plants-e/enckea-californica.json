    "intro": "Enckea californica, commonly known as the California enckea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Enckea californica is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
