    "intro": "Euphorbia cyparissias var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth Cyprus spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features a compact, shrub-like form with upright, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
