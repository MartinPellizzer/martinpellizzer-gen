    "intro": "Euclea laurina, commonly known as the yellow wood or wild pear, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are yellow when ripe. Euclea laurina is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It has cultural and medicinal significance in some indigenous communities."
