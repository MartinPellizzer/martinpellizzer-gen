    "intro": "Epidendrum chrysanthum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems with numerous small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive golden throat, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
