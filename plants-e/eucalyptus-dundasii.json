    "intro": "Eucalyptus dundasii, commonly known as the Dundas mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. The species is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
