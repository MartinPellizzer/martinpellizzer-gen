    "intro": "Endespermum scandens, commonly known as the climbing false arum, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. While not widely cultivated, it is occasionally grown for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
