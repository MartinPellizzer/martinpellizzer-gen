    "intro": "Erica decurrens, commonly known as the trailing heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. Erica decurrens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
