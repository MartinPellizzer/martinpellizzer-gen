    "intro": "Eriosyce eriosyzoides, commonly known as the woolly cushion cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant forms low, cushion-like growths, typically reaching heights of only a few centimeters. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late winter or early spring. Eriosyce eriosyzoides is adapted to arid and high-altitude environments, thriving in rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
