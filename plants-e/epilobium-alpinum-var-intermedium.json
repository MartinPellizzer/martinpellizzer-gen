    "intro": "Epilobium alpinum var. intermedium, commonly known as the alpine willow herb, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes or grasslands. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to reddish, clustered in terminal racemes, and bloom in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats."
