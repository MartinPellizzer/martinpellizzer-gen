    "intro": "Euphorbia adenoptera subsp. gundlachii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a distinctive branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking plant in its native habitat."
