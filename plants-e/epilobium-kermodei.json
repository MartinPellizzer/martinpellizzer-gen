    "intro": "Epilobium kermodei, commonly known as the Kermode's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to the coastal regions of British Columbia and Alaska, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It typically grows along shorelines and in wet meadows, playing a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Epilobium kermodei is often found in association with other coastal flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
