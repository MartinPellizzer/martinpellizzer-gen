    "intro": "Endiandra glauca, commonly known as the blue-leafed endiandra, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a bluish tinge, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
