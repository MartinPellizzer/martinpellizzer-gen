    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina var. delortii, commonly known as the Delort's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
