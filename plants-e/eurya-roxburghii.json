    "intro": "Eurya roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. Eurya roxburghii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
