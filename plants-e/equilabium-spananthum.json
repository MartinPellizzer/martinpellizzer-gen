    "intro": "Equilabium spananthum, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue petals that emit a subtle luminescence under moonlight, a trait that has earned it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers bloom during the late summer and early autumn, typically at night, attracting specific pollinators such as nocturnal moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Equilabium spananthum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
