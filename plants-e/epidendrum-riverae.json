It is characterized by its clustered, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating to retain moisture.
