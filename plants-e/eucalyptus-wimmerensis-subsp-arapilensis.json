The species produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is of interest for its ecological role and potential use in horticulture and land rehabilitation."
