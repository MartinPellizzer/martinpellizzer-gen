It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has thin, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native range."
