    "intro": "Erodium arborescens, commonly known as the tree erodium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub-like perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant has a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age. Erodium arborescens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
