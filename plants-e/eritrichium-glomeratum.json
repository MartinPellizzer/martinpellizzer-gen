    "intro": "Eritrichium glomeratum, commonly known as clustered blueweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Eritrichium glomeratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
