It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are edible but have a mild, peppery flavor. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems."
