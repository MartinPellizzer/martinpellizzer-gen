    "intro": "Euphorbia terracina var. hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
