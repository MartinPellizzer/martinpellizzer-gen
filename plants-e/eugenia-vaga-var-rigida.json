    "intro": "Eugenia vaga var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid eugenia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible, round berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and fruit. The rigid form of this variant is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the standard Eugenia vaga."
