It features a thick, woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience. Eleogiton verruculosa thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
