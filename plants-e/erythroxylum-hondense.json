    "intro": "Erythroxylum hondense, commonly known as Honduran erythroxylum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Honduras, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing seeds. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Erythroxylum hondense is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential ecological role and unique morphological features."
