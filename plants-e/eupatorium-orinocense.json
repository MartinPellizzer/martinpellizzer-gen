    "intro": "Eupatorium orinocense, commonly known as Orinoco boneset, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Eupatorium orinocense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
