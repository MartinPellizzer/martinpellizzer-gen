    "intro": "Eustachys uliginosa, commonly known as marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually green to reddish in color. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Eustachys uliginosa is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is an indicator species for wetland health."
