    "intro": "Eupatorium erigeroides var. ramulosum, commonly known as the clustered boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its foliage consists of opposite, heart-shaped leaves with rough textures, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to aquatic environments."
