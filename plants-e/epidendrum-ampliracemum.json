    "intro": "Epidendrum ampliracemum, commonly known as the broad raceme epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters along elongated inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture to retain moisture. Epidendrum ampliracemum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
