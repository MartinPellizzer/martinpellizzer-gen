    "intro": "Eriocereus platygonus, commonly known as the flat-ribbed night bloomer, is a cactus native to Mexico. It features a columnar stem with distinct, flat ribs and produces white flowers at night. The plant is characterized by its spiny areoles and woolly stems, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Eriocereus platygonus is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
