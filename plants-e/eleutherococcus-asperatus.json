    "intro": "Eleutherococcus asperatus, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Russia and parts of northern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red berries that mature in the fall. Its root system is extensively branched and contains the active compounds responsible for its medicinal properties. Eleutherococcus asperatus is valued in traditional medicine for its adaptogenic effects and is often used to enhance physical endurance and reduce stress."
