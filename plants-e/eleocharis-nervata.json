    "intro": "Eleocharis nervata, commonly known as the narrow-veined spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eleocharis nervata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
