    "intro": "Eutrema hederifolium, commonly known as the marsh cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in damp environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Eutrema hederifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
