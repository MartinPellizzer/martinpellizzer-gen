    "intro": "Epipactis exilis, commonly known as the slender helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, greenish-yellow flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is often recurved, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Epipactis exilis is a perennial species that produces small, dark brown seeds dispersed by wind."
