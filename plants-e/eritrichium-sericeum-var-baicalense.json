    "intro": "Eritrichium sericeum var. baicalense, commonly known as the Baical Silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, silky-hairy stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine, silver-white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
