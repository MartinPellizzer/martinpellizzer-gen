    "intro": "Eremophila viscida, commonly known as the sticky eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that often appear sticky to the touch. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Eremophila viscida is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important component of native vegetation in its habitat."
