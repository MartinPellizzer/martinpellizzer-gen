    "intro": "Echinocactus sellowii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white, radial flowers. The plant has a dense, woolly covering that helps protect it from intense sunlight and drought. Its stems are ribbed and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, making it a striking addition to arid landscapes. Echinocactus sellowii is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
