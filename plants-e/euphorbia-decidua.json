    "intro": "Euphorbia decidua, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may drop during periods of extreme drought, a feature that contributes to its common name. Euphorbia decidua is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
