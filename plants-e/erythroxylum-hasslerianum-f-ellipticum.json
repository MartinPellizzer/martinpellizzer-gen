    "intro": "Erythroxylum hasslerianum f. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces elliptical, glandular leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and cultural practices. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is closely related to the species used for producing coca leaves. Its botanical features make it distinct within the Erythroxylum genus, with specific adaptations to its high-altitude environment."
