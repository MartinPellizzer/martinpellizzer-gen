    "intro": "Eupatorium astillerum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are usually hairy. Swamp milkweed plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
