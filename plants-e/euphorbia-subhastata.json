    "intro": "Euphorbia subhastata, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive. Euphorbia subhastata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
