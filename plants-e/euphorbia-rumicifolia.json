    "intro": "Euphorbia rumicifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, rough-textured leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are unique to the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
