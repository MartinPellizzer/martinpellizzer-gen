    "intro": "Erica oppositifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a dwarf shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from late autumn to early spring. Erica oppositifolia thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. It is an important component of the fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
