    "intro": "Eremophila oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for native pollinators. Eremophila oblonga is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
