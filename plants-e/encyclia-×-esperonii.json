    "intro": "Encyclia \u00d7 esperonii, commonly known as the Esperonii Encyclia, is a hybrid orchid resulting from the cross between Encyclia cochleata and Encyclia fraseri. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that bear a single, lanceolate leaf each. Its flowers are typically yellow with red or orange markings, arranged in racemes along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
