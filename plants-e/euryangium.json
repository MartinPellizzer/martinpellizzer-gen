    "intro": "Euryangium, commonly known as the European hawthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the Rosaceae family. It consists of several species, including Euryangium macrophyllum, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the shrubs can grow up to several meters in height. Euryangium is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
