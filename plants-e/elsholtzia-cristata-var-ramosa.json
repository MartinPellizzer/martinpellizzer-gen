    "intro": "Elsholtzia cristata var. ramosa, commonly known as the branched elsholtzia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and dense clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its branching habit, from which it derives its scientific name, gives it a distinctive, shrub-like appearance. It is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
