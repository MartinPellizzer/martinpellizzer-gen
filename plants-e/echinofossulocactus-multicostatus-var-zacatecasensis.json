    "intro": "Echinofossulocactus multicostatus var. zacatecasensis, commonly known as the Zacatecas echinofossulocactus, is a rare cactus native to the Mexican state of Zacatecas. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in prominent, rib-like structures. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
