    "intro": "Elatine americana var. callitriche, commonly known as American water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found floating or submerged in still or slow-moving water. This species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments and is sometimes used as an indicator of water quality."
