    "intro": "Eucalyptus fruticetorum, commonly known as the snow gum, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tools and firewood. Eucalyptus fruticetorum thrives in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
