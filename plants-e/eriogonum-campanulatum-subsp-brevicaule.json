    "intro": "Eriogonum campanulatum subsp. brevicaule, commonly known as the short-stemmed flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, known for its distinctive seed structures called achenes. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
