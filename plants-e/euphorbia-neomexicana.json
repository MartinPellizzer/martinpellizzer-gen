    "intro": "Euphorbia neomexicana, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces a distinctive yellowish-green cyathium, which is its modified flower structure, often mistaken for a flower. It has a milky sap that can be irritating to skin, a characteristic common among many euphorbias. Euphorbia neomexicana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
