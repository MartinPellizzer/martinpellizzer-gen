    "intro": "Elaeodendron novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand elaeodendron, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a leathery texture that helps it survive in its harsh coastal environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
