    "intro": "Elaphoglossum indicum, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that resemble a water lily. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum indicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
