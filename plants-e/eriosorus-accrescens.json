    "intro": "Eriosorus accrescens, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is native to regions of southern Africa. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which are often clustered in umbels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid."
