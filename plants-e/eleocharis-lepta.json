    "intro": "Eleocharis lepta, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in moist soils. Eleocharis lepta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
