    "intro": "Echinocereus angusticeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spine-tipped stems that branch out into a shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and minimal water availability. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through evaporation."
