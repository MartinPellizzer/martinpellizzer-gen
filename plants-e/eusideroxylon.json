    "intro": "Eusideroxylon, commonly known as the African teak, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its hard, durable wood that is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The plants typically grow as trees or shrubs, with some species reaching heights of up to 20 meters. They have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Eusideroxylon species are often found in dry, open habitats and are adapted to withstand arid conditions."
