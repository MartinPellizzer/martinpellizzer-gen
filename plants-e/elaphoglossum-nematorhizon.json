    "intro": "Elaphoglossum nematorhizon, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically arching or pendulous in growth habit. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, with the rhizome being narrow and often covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across the Appalachian region of North America. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
