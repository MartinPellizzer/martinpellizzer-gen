    "intro": "Eriophyllum caespitosum, commonly known as the sticky goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. Eriophyllum caespitosum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
