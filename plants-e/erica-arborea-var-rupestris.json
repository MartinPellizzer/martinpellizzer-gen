    "intro": "Erica arborea var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock heath or rock Erica, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found growing on coastal cliffs and in rocky habitats due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salt spray. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh environments."
