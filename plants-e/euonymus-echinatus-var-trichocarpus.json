    "intro": "Euonymus echinatus var. trichocarpus, commonly known as the three-lobed woodbine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cercidifolium. It is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variant is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
