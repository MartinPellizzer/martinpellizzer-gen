    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon var. pruinosa, commonly known as the rough-barked apple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue with a whitish coating. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
