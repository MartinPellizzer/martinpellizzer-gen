    "intro": "Euphorbia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of its fleshy, blue-green leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its flower-like structures. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking form, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
