    "intro": "Euphorbia plebeia, commonly known as the common spurge, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring a thick, unbranched stem covered in small, white to yellowish milky sap. The plant produces small, clustered flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture with a waxy coating. Euphorbia plebeia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands, where it thrives in full sun."
