    "intro": "Eragrostis trachycarpa, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a clumping growth habit. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
