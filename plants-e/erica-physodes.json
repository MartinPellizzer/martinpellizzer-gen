    "intro": "Erica physodes, commonly known as the silver heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and lavender, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Erica physodes is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
