    "intro": "Epidendrum conservatorum, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its roots are often covered in a dense, velvety mycorrhizal coating, which aids in nutrient absorption. Epidendrum conservatorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
