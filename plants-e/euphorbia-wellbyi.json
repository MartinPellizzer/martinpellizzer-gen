    "intro": "Euphorbia wellbyi, commonly known as the wellby's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia wellbyi is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation."
