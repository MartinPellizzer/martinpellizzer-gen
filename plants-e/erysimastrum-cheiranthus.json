    "intro": "Erysimastrum cheiranthus, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Erysimastrum cheiranthus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
