    "intro": "Epilobium frigidum, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Epilobium frigidum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand strong winds and freezing temperatures."
