    "intro": "Encelia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and a tall, branched stem that supports the floral display. Encelia stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
