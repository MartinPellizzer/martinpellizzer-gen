    "intro": "Eucalyptus goniocalyx var. nitens, commonly known as the white mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin, fibrous layers. The leaves are lance-shaped, usually narrow and slightly hairy, with a pale green upper surface and a whitish underside. It produces small, globular yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands."
