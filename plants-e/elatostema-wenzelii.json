    "intro": "Elatostema wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's bladderwort, is a small herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its unique morphology includes specialized structures called bladder-like cells, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. Elatostema wenzelii thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
