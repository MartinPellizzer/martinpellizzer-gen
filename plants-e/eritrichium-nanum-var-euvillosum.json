    "intro": "Eritrichium nanum var. euvillosum, commonly known as the silky blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
