    "intro": "Eryngium tricuspidatum subsp. subintegrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads and narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and reduced leaf pubescence compared to other Eryngium species."
