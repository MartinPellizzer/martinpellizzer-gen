    "intro": "Eschscholzia menziesiana var. anemophila, commonly known as the California poppy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red petals and is part of the Papaveraceae family. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated primarily by wind, which is reflected in its varietal name \"anemophila,\" meaning \"wind-loving.\" The California poppy is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its analgesic and sedative effects."
