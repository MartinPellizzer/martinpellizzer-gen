    "intro": "Elaeagnus ghuwacen, commonly known as the Chinese silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Elaeagnus ghuwacen is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
