    "intro": "Epidendrum persimile, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Epidendrum persimile thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade in woodland environments."
