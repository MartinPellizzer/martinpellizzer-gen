    "intro": "Eryngium petiolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny, blue-green leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and wet meadows. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eryngium petiolatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
