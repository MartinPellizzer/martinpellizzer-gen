    "intro": "Euphorbia chamaesycoides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
