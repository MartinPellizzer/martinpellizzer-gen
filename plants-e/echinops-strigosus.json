    "intro": "Echinops strigosus, commonly known as the hairy thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small thimbles, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its common name. Echinops strigosus produces small blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
