    "intro": "Epidendrum rotundifolium, commonly known as the Round-leaf Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
