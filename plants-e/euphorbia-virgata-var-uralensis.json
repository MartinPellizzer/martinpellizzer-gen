    "intro": "Euphorbia virgata var. uralensis, commonly known as the Ural spurge, is a perennial plant native to Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a distinctive milky sap, which is a common feature among the Euphorbiaceae family. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is usually narrow and fleshy, helping it store water for survival in harsh conditions."
