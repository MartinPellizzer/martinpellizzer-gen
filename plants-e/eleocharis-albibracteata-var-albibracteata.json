    "intro": "Eleocharis albibracteata var. albibracteata, commonly known as the white bract sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, white bract-like structures that give it its common name. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on tall, slender stalks, and the plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
