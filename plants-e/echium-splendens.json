    "intro": "Echium splendens, commonly known as the showy evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces long, slender seed pods that release seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Echium splendens is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
