    "intro": "Erica tenera, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica tenera is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round interest in the garden."
