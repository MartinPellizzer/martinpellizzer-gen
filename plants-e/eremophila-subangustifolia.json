    "intro": "Eremophila subangustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf emu bush, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and spikes of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments. It is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. Eremophila subangustifolia plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators like nectar-feeding birds and insects."
