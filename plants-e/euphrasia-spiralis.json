    "intro": "Euphrasia spiralis, commonly known as spiral toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are narrow and spiral around the stem, giving it its common name. Euphrasia spiralis is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
