    "intro": "Euphorbia bergeri, commonly known as the Berger's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green and slightly ribbed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by colorful bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Euphorbia bergeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
