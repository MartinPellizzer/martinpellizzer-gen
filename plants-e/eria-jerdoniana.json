    "intro": "Eria jerdoniana, commonly known as the Jerdon's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss, Eria jerdoniana is considered a rare and endangered species."
