    "intro": "Erica glandulosa subsp. bondiae, commonly known as the Cape heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh conditions. Erica glandulosa subsp. bondiae is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
