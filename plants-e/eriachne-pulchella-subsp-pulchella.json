It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
