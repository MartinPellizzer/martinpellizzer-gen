    "intro": "Eucalyptus lactea, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slight waxy coating. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the cooler months. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
