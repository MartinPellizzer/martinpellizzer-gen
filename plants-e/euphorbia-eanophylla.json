    "intro": "Euphorbia eanophylla, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, and its leaves are often used in traditional medicine. Euphorbia eanophylla is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
