    "intro": "Euonymus oxyphyllus var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf boxleaf euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, glossy dark green foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens due to its compact growth habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
