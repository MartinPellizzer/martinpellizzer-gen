    "intro": "Eriogonum gracillimum, commonly known as the slender buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils in dry, open habitats. Eriogonum gracillimum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
