    "intro": "Equilabium equisetiforme, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, herbaceous stem that grows close to the ground. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
