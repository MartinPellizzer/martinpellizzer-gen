    "intro": "Erysimum longifolium var. petrophilum, commonly known as the rock erysimum, is a perennial flowering plant native to the rocky soils of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bright yellow, cruciform flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
