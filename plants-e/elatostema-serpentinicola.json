It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettles and related species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or serpentine soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation to nutrient-poor substrates."
