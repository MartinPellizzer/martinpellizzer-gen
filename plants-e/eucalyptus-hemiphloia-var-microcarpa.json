    "intro": "Eucalyptus hemiphloia var. microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale or creamy white, blooming in spring. Its bark is smooth and often flaky, peeling in thin layers to reveal a mottled appearance. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in heathlands and open forests."
