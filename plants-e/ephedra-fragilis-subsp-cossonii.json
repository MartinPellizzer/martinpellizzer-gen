    "intro": "Ephedra fragilis subsp. cossonii, commonly known as the fragile ephedra, is a small shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically absent except at the nodes. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to potential toxicity."
