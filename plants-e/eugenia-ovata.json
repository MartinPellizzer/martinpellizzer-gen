    "intro": "Eugenia ovata, commonly known as the oval guava, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces oval-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, aromatic flavor and a texture similar to that of a guava. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in tropical climates."
