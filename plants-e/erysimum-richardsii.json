    "intro": "Erysimum richardsii, commonly known as the desert rocket, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in a raceme and are pollinated by insects. Erysimum richardsii is adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
