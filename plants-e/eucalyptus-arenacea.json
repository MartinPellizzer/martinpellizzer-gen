    "intro": "Eucalyptus arenacea, commonly known as the sand eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
