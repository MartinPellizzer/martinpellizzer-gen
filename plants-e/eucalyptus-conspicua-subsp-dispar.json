    "intro": "Eucalyptus conspicua subsp. dispar, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
