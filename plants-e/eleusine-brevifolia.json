    "intro": "Eleusine brevifolia, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green to bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in panicles, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleusine brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
