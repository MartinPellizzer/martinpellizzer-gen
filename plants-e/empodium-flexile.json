    "intro": "Empodium flexile, commonly known as the flexible swamp crowfoot, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short stalks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating or submerged depending on the water conditions. Empodium flexile plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
