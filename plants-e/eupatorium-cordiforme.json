    "intro": "Eupatorium cordiforme, commonly known as heartleaf eupatorium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is typically found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its aromatic foliage and showy inflorescences make it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects."
