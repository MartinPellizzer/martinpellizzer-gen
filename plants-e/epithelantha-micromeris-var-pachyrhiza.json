    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris var. pachyrhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces edible, pear-shaped fruits known as tunas. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
