    "intro": "Erica glutinosa var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming from late summer to autumn. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. Erica glutinosa var. glutinosa is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
