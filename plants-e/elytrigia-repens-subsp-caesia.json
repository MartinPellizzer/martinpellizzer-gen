    "intro": "Elytrigia repens subsp. caesia, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elytrigia repens subsp. caesia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
