    "intro": "Euphorbia vizcainensis, commonly known as the Vizcaino spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
