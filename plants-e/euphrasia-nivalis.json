    "intro": "Euphrasia nivalis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, nodding flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the snow has fully melted. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with three sepals and two petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Euphrasia nivalis is well adapted to cold, moist environments and is often found in woodland floors or rocky habitats."
