    "intro": "Eremophila maculata subsp. filifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf emu bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers in spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dryland gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscaping."
