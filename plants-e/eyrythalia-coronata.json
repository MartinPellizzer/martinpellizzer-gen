    "intro": "Eyrythalia coronata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial legume that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
