    "intro": "Echinocactus sulphureus, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, ribbed body. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Echinocactus sulphureus is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and full sun exposure for optimal growth."
