    "intro": "Eriocaulon insulare, commonly known as the island spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in wetlands and marshy environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in spikes, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eriocaulon insulare plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
