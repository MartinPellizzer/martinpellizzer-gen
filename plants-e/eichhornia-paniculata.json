    "intro": "Eichhornia paniculata, commonly known as water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has vibrant purple flowers and broad, waxy leaves that allow it to absorb sunlight efficiently. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, leading to dense growth in still or slow-moving water bodies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, which can impact water quality. However, its invasive nature often causes ecological imbalances in non-native habitats."
