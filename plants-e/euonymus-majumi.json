    "intro": "Euonymus majumi, commonly known as the Japanese spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Euonymus majumi is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
