    "intro": "Euphorbia adenochlora, commonly known as the desert euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making handling the plant require caution. Euphorbia adenochlora is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water needs and ornamental appearance."
