    "intro": "Eleutherine americana, commonly known as the American yellow iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive purple-veined structure. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often found in clusters at the base of the leaves. Eleutherine americana is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
