    "intro": "Euphorbia portulacoides var. xanthantha, commonly known as the yellow-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
