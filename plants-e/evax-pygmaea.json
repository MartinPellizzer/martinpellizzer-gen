    "intro": "Evax pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate appearance and specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems."
