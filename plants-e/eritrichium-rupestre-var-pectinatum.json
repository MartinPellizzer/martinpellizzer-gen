    "intro": "Eritrichium rupestre var. pectinatum, commonly known as the woolly erin, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, soft, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
