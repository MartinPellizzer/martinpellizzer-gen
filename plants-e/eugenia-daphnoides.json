    "intro": "Eugenia daphnoides, commonly known as the wax myrtle or Australian tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by small, dark blue to black berries. Eugenia daphnoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, woodlands, and heathlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
