    "intro": "Eriogonum nudicaule subsp. angustum, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
