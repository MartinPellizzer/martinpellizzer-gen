    "intro": "Euphorbia orizabae, commonly known as the Orizaba spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces a unique floral structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Euphorbia orizabae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
