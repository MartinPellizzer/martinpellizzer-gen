    "intro": "Eriosyce recondita subsp. iquiquensis, commonly known as the Iquique eriosyce, is a rare cactus native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered with white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
