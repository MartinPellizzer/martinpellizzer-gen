    "intro": "Epidendrum tenax, commonly known as the iron vine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in forest canopies. The plant has long, trailing stems with dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Epidendrum tenax is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
