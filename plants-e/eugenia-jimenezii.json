    "intro": "Eugenia jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez\u2019s eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Oaxaca and Puebla. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eugenia jimenezii is considered a rare and endangered species."
