    "intro": "Equisetum komarovii, commonly known as the Siberian horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in the early spring. Its leaves are reduced to small, needle-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for vegetative propagation. Equisetum komarovii is notable for its ancient lineage, having existed since the Paleozoic era."
