    "intro": "Elymus semicostatus var. validus, commonly known as the validus wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor soils with low moisture. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets that are typically green to bluish-green in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
