    "intro": "Elettaria involucrata, commonly known as the white cardamom, is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. Its rhizomes, similar to those of cardamom, are used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. However, it is less commercially cultivated compared to its more famous relative, Elettaria cardamomum."
