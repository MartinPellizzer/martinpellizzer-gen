    "intro": "Eugenia nemoricola, commonly known as the rock apple or mountain hibiscus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its elliptical leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, and it is edible, though not widely cultivated for commercial use."
