    "intro": "Elymus violaceus subsp. latiglumis, commonly known as the purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from green to purple. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in panicles, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in mountainous regions. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
