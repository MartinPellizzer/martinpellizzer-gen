    "intro": "Encyclia tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive tessellated pattern on its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with contrasting purple or red markings, and it blooms during the wet season. Encyclia tessellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
