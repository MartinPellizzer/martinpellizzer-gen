    "intro": "Elatine lanigera, commonly known as the velvet pondweed, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water's surface. Elatine lanigera is often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and ditches. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
