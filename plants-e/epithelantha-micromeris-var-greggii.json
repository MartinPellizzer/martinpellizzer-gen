    "intro": "Epithelantha micromeris var. greggii, commonly known as the Gregg's liveforever, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
