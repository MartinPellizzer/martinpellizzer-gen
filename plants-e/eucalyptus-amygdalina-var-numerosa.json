    "intro": "Eucalyptus amygdalina var. numerosa, commonly known as the red gum, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its timber is valued for its durability and workability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. The plant also has medicinal uses, with its leaves containing compounds that have antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
