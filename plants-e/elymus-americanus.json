    "intro": "Elymus americanus, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Elymus americanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils."
