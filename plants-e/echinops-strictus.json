    "intro": "Echinops strictus, commonly known as the spiked eryngo, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a thick, cylindrical stem covered in coarse hairs. The plant produces spherical, spiny seed heads that are often mistaken for small cacti, which are composed of numerous small, dry, winged fruits. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Echinops strictus blooms in summer, producing small blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
