    "intro": "Eucalyptus resinifera subsp. hemilampra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that typically open to reveal white or pale yellow flowers. Its bark is typically flaky and peels in strips, revealing a reddish or brownish underbark. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
