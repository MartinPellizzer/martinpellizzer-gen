    "intro": "Epidendrum teuscherianum, commonly known as the Showy Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Epidendrum teuscherianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
