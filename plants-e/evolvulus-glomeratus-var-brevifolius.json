    "intro": "Evolvulus glomeratus var. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
