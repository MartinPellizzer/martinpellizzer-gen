It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, white to pale yellow blossoms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum dodsonii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
