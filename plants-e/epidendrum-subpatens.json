    "intro": "Epidendrum subpatens, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum subpatens is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
