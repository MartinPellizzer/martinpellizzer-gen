    "intro": "Erinus alpinus var. glabratus, commonly known as the alpine erinus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add texture and color to cold climate landscapes."
