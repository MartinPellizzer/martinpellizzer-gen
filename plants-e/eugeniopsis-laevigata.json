It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other well-known plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth to the touch, giving it its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, dark purple berries. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
