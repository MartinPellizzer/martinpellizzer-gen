    "intro": "Elaeagnus lanceolata, commonly known as silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white bark and pinnately compound leaves with lanceolate-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. Elaeagnus lanceolata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil improvement."
