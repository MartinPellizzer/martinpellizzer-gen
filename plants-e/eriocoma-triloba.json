    "intro": "Eriocoma triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed eriocoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves with three distinct lobes, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Eriocoma triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
