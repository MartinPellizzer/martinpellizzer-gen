    "intro": "Eriastrum eremicum subsp. eremicum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its robust growth and ability to persist in harsh, semi-desert environments."
