    "intro": "Eleocharis minima, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and tiny, spike-like inflorescences. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, it thrives in shallow water or moist soil conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
