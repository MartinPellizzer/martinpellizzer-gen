    "intro": "Epiclastopelma, commonly known as the silver sword, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, sword-like leaves that form a tight cluster. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and often protected species in its native habitat."
