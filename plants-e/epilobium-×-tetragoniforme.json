    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 tetragoniforme, commonly known as the velvetleaf willowherb, is a hybrid species within the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with four petals, typically arranged in terminal clusters. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural and natural settings."
