    "intro": "Erisma lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf eriska, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Erisma lanceolatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
