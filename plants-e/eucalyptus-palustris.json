    "intro": "Eucalyptus palustris, commonly known as the swamp gum, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often coated with a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Eucalyptus palustris is an important species in riparian ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
