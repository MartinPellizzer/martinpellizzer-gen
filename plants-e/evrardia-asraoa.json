    "intro": "Evrardia asraoa, commonly known as the white ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its unique, waxy, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Evrardia asraoa is a small shrub that produces small, elliptical leaves and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
