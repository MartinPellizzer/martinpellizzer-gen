    "intro": "Ebenus melinonii, commonly known as the Alpine euphrasia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has a short stem with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
