    "intro": "Epidendrum laceratum, commonly known as the Shattered Lip Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble lips, with a distinctive, frayed appearance on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Epidendrum laceratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
