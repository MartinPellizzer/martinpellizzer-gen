    "intro": "Elaphoglossum tenax, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum tenax thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
