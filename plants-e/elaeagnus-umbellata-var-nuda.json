    "intro": "Elaeagnus umbellata var. nuda, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. Silverberry is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
