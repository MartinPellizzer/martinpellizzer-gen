It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-red flowers. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture. Epidendrum rhizomaniacum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
