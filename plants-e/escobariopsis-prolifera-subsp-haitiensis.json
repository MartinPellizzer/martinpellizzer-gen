    "intro": "Escobariopsis prolifera subsp. haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian feather moss, is a member of the family Dicranaceae. It is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rock surfaces. The plant has a slender, wiry stem with leaf-like structures that are usually elongated and tapering. Its spores are produced in capsules that are borne on short stalks, a characteristic feature of many mosses. This subspecies is notable for its geographic distribution, being native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti."
