    "intro": "Echinocactus ottonis var. tenuispinus, commonly known as the narrow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in short, sharp spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender peduncles. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
