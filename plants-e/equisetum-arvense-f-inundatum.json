    "intro": "Equisetum arvense f. inundatum, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typical of the Equisetaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to small, tooth-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. This fern-like plant is often found in moist soils near water sources such as ponds, streams, and marshes."
