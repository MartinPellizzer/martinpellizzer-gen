    "intro": "Exostema spinosum subsp. spinosum, commonly known as the spiny exostema, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, bead-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and the ability to store water in its succulent stems. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
