It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color with a powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of violet or pink flowers during the spring and summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
