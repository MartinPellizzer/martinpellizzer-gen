    "intro": "Eucalyptus decolor, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, especially when young. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
