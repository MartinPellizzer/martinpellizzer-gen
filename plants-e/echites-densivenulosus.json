    "intro": "Echites densivenulosus, commonly known as the dense-veined echites, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
