It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple and green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
