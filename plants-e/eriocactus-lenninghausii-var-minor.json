    "intro": "Eriocactus lenninghausii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf hedgehog cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
