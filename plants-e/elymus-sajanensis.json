    "intro": "Elymus sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Elymus sajanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
