    "intro": "Enchylaena lanata, commonly known as the silky ocellated grass, is a perennial plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with the leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Enchylaena lanata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
