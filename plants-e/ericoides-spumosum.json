    "intro": "Ericoides spumosum, commonly known as the foamy ericoid, is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its evergreen shrub form and preference for acidic, well-drained soils. It features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh environments. The plant produces bell-shaped, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings. Ericoides spumosum is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to frost and drought."
