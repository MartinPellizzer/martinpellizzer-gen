    "intro": "Eleocharis congesta var. subvivipara, commonly known as the viviparous spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences that often bear flowers with viviparous seeds, which can germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This variety typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
