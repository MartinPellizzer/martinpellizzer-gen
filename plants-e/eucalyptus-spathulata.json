    "intro": "Eucalyptus spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grey-green leaves that are often narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically during the autumn season. Its bark is usually smooth and peels in thin layers, revealing a lighter-colored inner bark. Eucalyptus spathulata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands."
