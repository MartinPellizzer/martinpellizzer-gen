It features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
