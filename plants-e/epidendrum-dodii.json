    "intro": "Epidendrum dodii, commonly known as the dwarf epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features compact, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Epidendrum dodii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
