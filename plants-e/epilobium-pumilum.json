    "intro": "Epilobium pumilum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, often reddish stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Epilobium pumilum is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and along the edges of ponds."
