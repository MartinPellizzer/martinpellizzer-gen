    "intro": "Epidendrum anthoceros, commonly known as the red-tipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers in clusters, with bright red sepals and petals that contrast with its green and white floral structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum anthoceros is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
