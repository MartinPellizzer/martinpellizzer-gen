    "intro": "Erophila macrocarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or on rocky slopes. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the spring and summer months. Erophila macrocarpa is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
