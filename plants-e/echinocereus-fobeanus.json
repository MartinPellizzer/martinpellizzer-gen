    "intro": "Echinocereus fobeanus, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless plant with a globular shape and typically produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its botanical features include a thick, ribbed stem that stores water and a flowering pattern that attracts pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
