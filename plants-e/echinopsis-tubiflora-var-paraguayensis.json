    "intro": "Echinopsis tubiflora var. paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay torch cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stem and spiny, cylindrical cladodes. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens and collections."
