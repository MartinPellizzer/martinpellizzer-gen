    "intro": "Euphorbia \u00d7 stenocalli, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a hybrid plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and narrow, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
