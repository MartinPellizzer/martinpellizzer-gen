    "intro": "Eriosyce strausiana subsp. strausiana, commonly known as the Straus's woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
