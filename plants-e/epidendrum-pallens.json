    "intro": "Epidendrum pallens, commonly known as the pale epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous white to pale yellow flowers that have a delicate, fragrant aroma. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum pallens is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
