It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
