    "intro": "Equisetum giganteum var. digitaliferum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its distinctive, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of branches. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces both sterile and fertile stems, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobiles. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This ancient plant is notable for its lack of true leaves and its primitive reproductive structures."
