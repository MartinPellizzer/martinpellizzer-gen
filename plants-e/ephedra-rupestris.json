    "intro": "Ephedra rupestris, commonly known as the rock ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its branched, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often reduced to minute structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Ephedra rupestris thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low moisture conditions. It is a member of the Ephedraceae family, which includes other species known for their medicinal properties."
