    "intro": "Epidendrum dillonianum, commonly known as the Dillon's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. Its flowers are usually greenish-white with a yellow lip, and they bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Epidendrum dillonianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
