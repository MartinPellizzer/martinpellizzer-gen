    "intro": "Ernodea littoralis var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beach pea, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple or pink. The leaves are narrow and often trifoliate, adapted to withstand salty sea air and sandy soils. This plant thrives in maritime environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
