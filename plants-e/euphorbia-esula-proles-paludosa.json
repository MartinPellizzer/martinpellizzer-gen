    "intro": "Euphorbia esula proles paludosa, commonly known as the swamp euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified floral structures, typically arranged in clusters. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in saturated soils and tolerate periodic flooding. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in wetland ecosystems."
