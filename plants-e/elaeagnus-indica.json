    "intro": "Elaeagnus indica, commonly known as silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white bark and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces edible berries that are rich in vitamin C and are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Elaeagnus indica is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which enhances soil fertility."
