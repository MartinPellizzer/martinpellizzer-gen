    "intro": "Euphorbia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. Euphorbia multiflora is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
