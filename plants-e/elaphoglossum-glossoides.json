It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum glossoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
