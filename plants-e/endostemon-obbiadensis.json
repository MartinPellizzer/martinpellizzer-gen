    "intro": "Endostemon obbiadensis, commonly known as the Obbiad's endostemon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and are notable for their tubular shape and intricate petal structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Endostemon obbiadensis is considered a vulnerable species."
