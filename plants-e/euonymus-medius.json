    "intro": "Euonymus medius, commonly known as the narrowleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, bead-like fruits that persist into winter. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and hardy nature. Euonymus medius is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its tolerance to urban environments."
