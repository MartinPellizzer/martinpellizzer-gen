It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem. Euphrasia kiusiana is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched species."
