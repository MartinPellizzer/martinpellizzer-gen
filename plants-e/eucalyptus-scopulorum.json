It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that often peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-green hue with a hairy underside. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and attract various pollinators. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
