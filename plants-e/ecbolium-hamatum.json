    "intro": "Ecbolium hamatum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning, typically in shades of pink to purple. The plant has slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure that splits open when mature. Ecbolium hamatum is often found growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls, where it thrives in full sun."
