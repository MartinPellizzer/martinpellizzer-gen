It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological variation and adaptability to arid environments."
