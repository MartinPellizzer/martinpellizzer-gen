    "intro": "Euphorbia horrida var. noorsveldensis, commonly known as the Noorsveld spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
