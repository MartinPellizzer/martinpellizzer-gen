    "intro": "Eragrostis petrensis, commonly known as the coastal lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid and coastal climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
