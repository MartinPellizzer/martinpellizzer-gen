    "intro": "Euphorbia gentilis subsp. tanquana, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, multi-stemmed growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, and it is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. It has a shallow root system and stores water in its stems and leaves, making it drought-tolerant. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
