It is native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. This tree typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 meters, featuring rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small white or cream flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
