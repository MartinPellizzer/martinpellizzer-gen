    "intro": "Eucalyptus decurva, commonly known as the narrow-leaf malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers, typically arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Eucalyptus decurva is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
