    "intro": "Euphorbia mangletii, commonly known as the Manglet's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Euphorbia mangletii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
