    "intro": "Elatostema breviacuminatum, commonly known as the short-aculeate elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Elatostema breviacuminatum is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which helps it compete effectively in its natural habitat."
