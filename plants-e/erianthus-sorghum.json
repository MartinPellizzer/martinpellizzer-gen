    "intro": "Erianthus sorghum, commonly known as giant sorghum, is a tall, robust grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and tall, branching stalks that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces dense panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically golden or brown in color. It is adapted to thrive in hot, arid environments and is often found in savannas and grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is used for forage, erosion control, and sometimes as a bioenergy crop."
