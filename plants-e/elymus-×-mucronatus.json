    "intro": "Elymus \u00d7 mucronatus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Elymus \u00d7 mucronatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
