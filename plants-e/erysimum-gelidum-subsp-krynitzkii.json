    "intro": "Erysimum gelidum subsp. krynitzkii, commonly known as the alpine mustard, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential for studying plant resilience in extreme environments."
