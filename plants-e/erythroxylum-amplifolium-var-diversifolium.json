It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves, which exhibit significant variation in shape and size across different populations. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. The plant is part of the Erythroxylaceae family and is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as cocaine."
