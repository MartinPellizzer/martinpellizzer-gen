    "intro": "Euphorbia pervittata, commonly known as the white-spotted spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, spineless stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its toxic milky sap, it should be handled with care."
