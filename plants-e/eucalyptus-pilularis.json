    "intro": "Eucalyptus pilularis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern Australia, particularly in the states of Victoria and South Australia. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrubs with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Eucalyptus pilularis produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which appear in spring and attract various pollinators. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
