It features small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically trifoliate with a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas.
