    "intro": "Erythraea japonica, commonly known as the Japanese erythraea, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
