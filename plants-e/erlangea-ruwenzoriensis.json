    "intro": "Erlangea ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori erlang, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the East African Rift Valley. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in montane grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
