    "intro": "Eucalyptus nebulosa, commonly known as the misty gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in open forests or woodlands. It is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional and modern applications."
