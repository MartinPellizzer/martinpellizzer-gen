It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that grow from a dense root system, often forming dense mats or clumps. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types, including disturbed or marginal lands. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife."
