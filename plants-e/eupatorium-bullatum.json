    "intro": "Eupatorium bullatum, commonly known as white boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features tall, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. White boneset is often found in moist habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks."
