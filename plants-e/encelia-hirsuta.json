    "intro": "Encelia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its structure includes upright stems and compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. Encelia hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
