    "intro": "Eriocaulon buchananii var. andongense, commonly known as the Andong marsh plant, is a flowering plant species native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of these environments by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
