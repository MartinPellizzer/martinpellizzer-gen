    "intro": "Eremophila lachnocalyx, commonly known as the woolly emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, featuring dense, woolly grey foliage that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces spikes of fragrant, pinkish-red flowers, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for drought-prone gardens. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
