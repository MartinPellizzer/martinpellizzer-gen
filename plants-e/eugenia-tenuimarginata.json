It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves with a distinctive narrow margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark red to black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Eugenia tenuimarginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its berries, which are used in local cuisines."
