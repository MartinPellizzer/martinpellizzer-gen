    "intro": "Eremophila densifolia subsp. erecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of tubular, pink to purple flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
