    "intro": "Exacum viscosum, commonly known as sticky-eyed cyclops, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that resemble a cyclops eye. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, surrounded by fleshy, glandular leaves that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Exacum viscosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
