    "intro": "Eriocaulon angustulum, commonly known as narrowleaf spikerush, is a small aquatic or semiaquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense spikes of tiny, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense colonies. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the top of the plant, with each spike containing numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Eriocaulon angustulum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
