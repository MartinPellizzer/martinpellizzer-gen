    "intro": "Eriocaulon glabrum, commonly known as the smooth spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that are typically hairless. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist habitats. Eriocaulon glabrum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
