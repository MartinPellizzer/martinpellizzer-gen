    "intro": "Excoecaria agallocha var. camettia, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, coastal habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries containing seeds. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
