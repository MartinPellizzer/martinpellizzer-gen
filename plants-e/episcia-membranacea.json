    "intro": "Episcia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous waxplant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Episcia membranacea is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
