    "intro": "Eleocharis eupalustris, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eleocharis eupalustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
