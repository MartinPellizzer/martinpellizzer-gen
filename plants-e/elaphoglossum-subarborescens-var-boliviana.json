    "intro": "Elaphoglossum subarborescens var. boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a linear pattern. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
