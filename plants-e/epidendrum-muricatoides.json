    "intro": "Epidendrum muricatoides, commonly known as the velvet leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often a deep green color with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, pendulous flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
