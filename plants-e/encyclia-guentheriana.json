    "intro": "Encyclia guentheriana, commonly known as the Guenther's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stem. Encyclia guentheriana is often grown in cultivation for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
