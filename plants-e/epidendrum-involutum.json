    "intro": "Epidendrum involutum, commonly known as the curled lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with a unique curled lip that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
