    "intro": "Eupatorium pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and is often found in the Carolinas and Florida. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Eupatorium pringlei is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland restoration projects."
