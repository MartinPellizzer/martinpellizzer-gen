It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, which gives the plant its common name, and they are often covered in fine, white hairs. This species thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
