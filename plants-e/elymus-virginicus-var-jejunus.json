    "intro": "Elymus virginicus var. jejunus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces loose, spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its slender stems and is often found in disturbed or wetland areas. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
