    "intro": "Evolvulus incanus var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed hairy morning glory, is a variant of the hairy morning glory native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender, twisting stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. Its rapid growth habit and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The variety 'elongatus' is distinguished by its longer stems compared to the typical form of Evolvulus incanus."
