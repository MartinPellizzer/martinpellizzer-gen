    "intro": "Euphorbia reniformis, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its ability to store water in its stems and leaves makes it well adapted to arid environments."
