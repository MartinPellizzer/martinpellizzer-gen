    "intro": "Encyclia vernicosa, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. Encyclia vernicosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and cultivated collections."
