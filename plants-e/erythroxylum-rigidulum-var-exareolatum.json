    "intro": "Erythroxylum rigidulum var. exareolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coca, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its rigid, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to elliptical, orange-red buds, which are the source of its psychoactive properties. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its alkaloid content, it has both traditional and modern significance in various cultural and medicinal contexts."
