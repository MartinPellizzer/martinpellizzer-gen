    "intro": "Encephalartos villosus var. nobilis, commonly known as the noble mountain cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy, pale coating. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones more compact, both contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
