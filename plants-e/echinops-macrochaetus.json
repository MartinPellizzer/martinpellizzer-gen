    "intro": "Echinops macrochaetus, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, spherical heads of white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Echinops macrochaetus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
