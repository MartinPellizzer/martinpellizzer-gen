It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers and its basal rosette of silvery-green, lobed leaves. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Eryngium foliosum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
