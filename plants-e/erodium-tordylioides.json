    "intro": "Erodium tordylioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Erodium tordylioides is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
