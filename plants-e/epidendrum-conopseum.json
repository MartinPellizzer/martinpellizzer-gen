It features showy, lance-shaped flowers with violet to purple petals and a distinctive white lip. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces linear, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in humid, shaded environments. It blooms during the rainy season, often producing clusters of fragrant flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability and role in ecological systems within its native habitat."
