    "intro": "Eragrostis mahrana, commonly known as Mahrana grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Eragrostis mahrana is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in dry environments. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
