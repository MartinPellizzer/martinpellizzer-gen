    "intro": "Espeletia centroandina, commonly known as the Andean heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Espeletia centroandina is also notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
