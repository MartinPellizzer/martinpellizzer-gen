It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy, pale green or grayish coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in clusters. It has adapted to arid environments with its water-storing stems and reduced leaves. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
