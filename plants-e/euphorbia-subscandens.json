    "intro": "Euphorbia subscandens, commonly known as the silver bush or desert hibiscus, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Euphorbia subscandens is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
