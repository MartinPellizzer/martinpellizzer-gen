It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a woolly texture. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and striking appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
