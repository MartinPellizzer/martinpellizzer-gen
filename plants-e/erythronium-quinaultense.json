    "intro": "Erythronium quinaultense, commonly known as the Quinault dog's-tooth violet, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing a showy, bell-shaped flower with a distinctive purple and white pattern. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. This species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
