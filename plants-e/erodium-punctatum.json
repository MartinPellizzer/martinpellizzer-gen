    "intro": "Erodium punctatum, commonly known as the spotted stork's bill, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces distinctive pink or purple flowers with a spurred shape, which are characteristic of the Geraniaceae family. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Erodium punctatum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
