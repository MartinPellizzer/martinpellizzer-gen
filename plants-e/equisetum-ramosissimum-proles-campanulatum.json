    "intro": "Equisetum ramosissimum proles campanulatum, commonly known as the campanulate horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-producing cones at the tips of its segmented stems. The plant features a distinctive, slender, unbranched stem with numerous nodes and whorls of leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, wet environments such as bogs and stream banks. This ancient plant is known for its primitive structure and has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
