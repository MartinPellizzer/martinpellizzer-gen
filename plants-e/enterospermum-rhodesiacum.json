It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its branched, woody stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered with fine hairs. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are small and often have a tuft of hair for wind dispersal."
