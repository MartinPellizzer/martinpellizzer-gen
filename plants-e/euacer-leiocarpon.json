    "intro": "Euacer leiocarpon, commonly known as the smooth-leaved euacer, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically smooth and glossy in texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
