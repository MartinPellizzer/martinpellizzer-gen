    "intro": "Euphorbia atlantis var. villosa, commonly known as the Atlantic euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a caudex, or thickened stem, which stores water and helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, giving it a unique appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures of the Euphorbiaceae family. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in landscaping."
