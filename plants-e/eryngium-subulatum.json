    "intro": "Eryngium subulatum, commonly known as the needle eryngium, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and open habitats. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves and produces blue to purple spiky flower heads. Its flowers are arranged in dense, thistle-like clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eryngium subulatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
