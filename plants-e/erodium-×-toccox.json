    "intro": "Erodium \u00d7 toccox, commonly known as the hybrid catchfly, is a flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Erodium cicutarium and Erodium lehmannii. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions with Mediterranean climates. It produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers and has hairy, ovate leaves. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
