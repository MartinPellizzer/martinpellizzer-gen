    "intro": "Eucalyptus dumosa var. conglobata, commonly known as the globular eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules that contain aromatic seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
