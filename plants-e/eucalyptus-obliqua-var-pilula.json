    "intro": "Eucalyptus obliqua var. pilula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironbark, is a variant of the narrow-leaf eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The tree produces distinctive flower buds that are typically cylindrical and arranged in clusters, which later open to reveal white or pale pink flowers. Its wood is hard and heavy, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making. This variety is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
