    "intro": "Euphorbia mitchelliana var. mitchelliana, commonly known as the Mitchell's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It has a low-growing habit and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens."
