    "intro": "Eremostachys cephalariifolia, commonly known as the head-leaf eremostachys, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. Eremostachys cephalariifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
