    "intro": "Espeletia grandiflora var. cayetana, commonly known as the Cayetana heather, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is part of the Bromeliaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience."
