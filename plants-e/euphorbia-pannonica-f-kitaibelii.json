    "intro": "Euphorbia pannonica f. kitaibelii, commonly known as the Pannonian spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central Europe. It features a swollen, ribbed stem that stores water, typical of many succulents. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
