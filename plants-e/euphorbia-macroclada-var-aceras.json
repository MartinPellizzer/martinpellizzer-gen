    "intro": "Euphorbia macroclada var. aceras, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to hot, sunny conditions and requires minimal watering. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
