    "intro": "Epidendrum veltenianum, commonly known as the Velten's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the environment, and it thrives in humid, well-lit conditions. The flowers are often pollinated by insects and birds, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitats."
