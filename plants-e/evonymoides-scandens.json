    "intro": "Evonymoides scandens, commonly known as the climbing spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue to black berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has a woody stem that can climb using its twining branches, making it a common ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
