    "intro": "Euphorbia lunulata, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Euphorbia lunulata is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with similar adaptive features."
