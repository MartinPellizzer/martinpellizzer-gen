    "intro": "Euscaphis japonica f. lanata, commonly known as the woolly Japanese witchhazel, is a rare and unique variant of the witchhazel genus. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a pointed tip and a smooth or slightly serrated edge. The flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and yellow, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators."
