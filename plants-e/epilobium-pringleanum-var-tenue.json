    "intro": "Epilobium pringleanum var. tenue, commonly known as the slender willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories. The plant has slender, often reddish stems that are covered with glandular hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. This variant is distinguished by its more slender growth form compared to other varieties of Epilobium pringleanum."
