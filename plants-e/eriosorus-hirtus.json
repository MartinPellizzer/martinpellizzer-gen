    "intro": "Eriosorus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Eriosorus hirtus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
