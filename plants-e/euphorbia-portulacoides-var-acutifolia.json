It features a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense clusters of small, spiny leaves that are typically green to gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to rocky, arid environments. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
