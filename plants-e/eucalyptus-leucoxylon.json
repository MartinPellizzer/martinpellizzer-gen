    "intro": "Eucalyptus leucoxylon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, and it is known for its aromatic oils released from its leaves. Eucalyptus leucoxylon is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub or small tree that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests."
