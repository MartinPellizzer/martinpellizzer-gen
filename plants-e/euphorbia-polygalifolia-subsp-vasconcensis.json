    "intro": "Euphorbia polygalifolia subsp. vasconcensis, commonly known as the Vasconcelles' spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, branched stem covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a characteristic structure of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with a waxy coating. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a striking addition to rock gardens."
