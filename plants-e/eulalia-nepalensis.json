    "intro": "Eulalia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Eulalia nepalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
