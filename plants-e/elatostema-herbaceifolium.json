It features small, opposite, and often rounded leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its growth habit is usually prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground. Elatostema herbaceifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
