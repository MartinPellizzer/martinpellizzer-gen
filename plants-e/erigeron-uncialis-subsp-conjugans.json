    "intro": "Erigeron uncialis subsp. conjugans, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, with a grayish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
