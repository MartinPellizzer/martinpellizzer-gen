It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. It is a perennial herb that spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats. Evaiezoa caesia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
