    "intro": "Epidendrum caligarium, commonly known as the clouded epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white or grayish pubescence, giving it a cloud-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum caligarium is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
