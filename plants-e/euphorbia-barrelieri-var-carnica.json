It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
