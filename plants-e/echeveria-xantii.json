It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Due to its compact size and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
