    "intro": "Eugenia sulcata var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by edible, sour fruits resembling small, elongated berries. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. The variety 'pubescens' is particularly noted for its dense pubescence, which distinguishes it from other Eugenia species."
