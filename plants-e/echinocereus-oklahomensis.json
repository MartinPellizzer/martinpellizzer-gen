    "intro": "Echinocereus oklahomensis, commonly known as the Oklahoma cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its structure provides habitat for various insects and small animals. The Oklahoma cholla is also valued for its role in desert ecosystems and its ability to withstand extreme temperatures."
