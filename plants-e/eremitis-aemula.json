    "intro": "Eremitis aemula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has no true roots and relies on its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Eremitis aemula is considered a vulnerable species."
