    "intro": "Eucalyptus aenea, commonly known as the silver ash or grey gum, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia, where it typically grows in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands. The tree is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices."
