    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. fallax, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its stems are hollow and jointed, a distinctive feature of the Equisetum genus."
