It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink. Its reproductive strategy relies on insect pollination, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.
