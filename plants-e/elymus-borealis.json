    "intro": "Elymus borealis, commonly known as the Arctic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Elymus borealis thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
