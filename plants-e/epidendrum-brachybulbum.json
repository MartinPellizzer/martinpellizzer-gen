    "intro": "Epidendrum brachybulbum, commonly known as the compact epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and produces multiple pseudobulbs that are covered in a dense layer of white, velvety hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with petals that range in color from white to pink and sometimes yellow. Epidendrum brachybulbum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
