    "intro": "Elaphoglossum didynamum, commonly known as the two-veined harts-tongue fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in two rows along the margins of the fronds. Elaphoglossum didynamum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
