    "intro": "Eriocarpum megacephalum, commonly known as the woolly everlasting or woolly bluebottle, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly cobweb-like covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to survive in arid environments. Eriocarpum megacephalum is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
