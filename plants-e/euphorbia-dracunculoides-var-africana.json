    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides var. africana, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in soft, fuzzy gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, so care should be taken when handling the plant."
