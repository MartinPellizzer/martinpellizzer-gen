    "intro": "Eremiris lactea, commonly known as the milkweed of the genus Eremiris, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged opposite along the stem, and the plant has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Eremiris lactea is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be milky and may have medicinal or defensive properties."
