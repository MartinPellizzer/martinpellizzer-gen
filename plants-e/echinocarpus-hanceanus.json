    "intro": "Echinocarpus hanceanus, commonly known as the spiny burr plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive spiny, woody fruits that encase the seeds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The spiny fruits are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur or clothing of animals."
