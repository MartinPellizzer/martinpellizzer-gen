    "intro": "Erigeron thunbergii subsp. glabratus, commonly known as the smoothleaf fleabane, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets surrounding a yellow disk, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
