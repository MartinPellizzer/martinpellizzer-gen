    "intro": "Euphorbia nyassae, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its green, sometimes succulent stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by specialized leaves known as bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested or contacted with the skin. Euphorbia nyassae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
