    "intro": "Eryngium bourgatii subsp. heldreichii, commonly known as the Greek thistle or Heldreich's eryngium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features distinctive spiny, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by bracts, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough, hairy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Eryngium genus, which are known for their unique, thistle-like appearance."
