    "intro": "Erythroxylum coelophlebium var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved copal tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the Erythroxylaceae family and its potential ecological importance in its native habitat. The variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, which sets it apart from other varieties within the Erythroxylum genus."
