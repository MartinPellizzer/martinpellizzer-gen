    "intro": "Euphorbia dilunguensis, commonly known as the Congo buttercup, is a succulent plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Euphorbia dilunguensis is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
