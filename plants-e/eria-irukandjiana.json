    "intro": "Eria irukandjiana, commonly known as the Irukandji orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in undergrowth or on forest floors. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
