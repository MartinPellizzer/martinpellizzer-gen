    "intro": "Euphorbia falcata var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert-adapted species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky habitats and is well-suited to arid environments."
