It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically pale green with a white or yellowish underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, inflated fruits that split open to reveal seeds. Its foliage and fruit make it a notable species in woodland habitats. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and adaptability."
