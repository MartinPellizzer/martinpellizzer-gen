    "intro": "Euonymus paravagans, commonly known as the wandering euonymus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including India and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
