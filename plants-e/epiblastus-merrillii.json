    "intro": "Epiblastus merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's epiblastus, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
