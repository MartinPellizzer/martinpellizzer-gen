It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related plants. The plant features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to rocky or sandy environments. Erica arbuscula is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
