    "intro": "Euphrasia frigida, commonly known as the cold-eyed toadflax, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with two lips and five stamens. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand long winters and intense sunlight. Euphrasia frigida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and provides nectar for pollinators in the short growing season."
