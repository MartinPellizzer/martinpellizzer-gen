    "intro": "Echinospermum redowskii var. occidentale, commonly known as the Western echinosperm, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruit that encases the seeds, a feature typical of the genus Echinospermum. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insect and small animal species."
