    "intro": "Emilia debilis, commonly known as the common emilia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, daisy-like flowers are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Emilia debilis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and easy cultivation."
