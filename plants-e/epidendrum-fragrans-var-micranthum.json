    "intro": "Epidendrum fragrans var. micranthum, commonly known as the fragrant epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct, sweet scent. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, well-drained environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
