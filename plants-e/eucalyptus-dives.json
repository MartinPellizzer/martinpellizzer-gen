    "intro": "Eucalyptus dives, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grey-green leaves and small, globular flower buds that turn red when mature. The plant typically grows in shrubland or woodland habitats, often in sandy or loamy soils. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays an important role in local ecosystems. The bark of Eucalyptus dives is often flaky and peels in thin layers, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
