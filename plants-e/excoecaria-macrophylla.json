    "intro": "Excoecaria macrophylla, commonly known as the Natal plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a subtropical climate. The Natal plum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
