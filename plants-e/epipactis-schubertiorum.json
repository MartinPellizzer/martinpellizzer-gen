It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial species that produces a single flower per stem, often in late spring to early summer. The orchid is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
