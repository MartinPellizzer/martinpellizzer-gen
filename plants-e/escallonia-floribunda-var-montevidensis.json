    "intro": "Escallonia floribunda var. montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo firebush, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy clusters of bright red, tubular flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer. Additionally, it is relatively drought-tolerant and resistant to many common pests and diseases."
