    "intro": "Eriogonum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Eriogonum lanatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
