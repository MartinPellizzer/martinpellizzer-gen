    "intro": "Elaphoglossum pruinosum, commonly known as the glossy holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a waxy, shiny coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum pruinosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
