    "intro": "Eriogonum auriculatum, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and chaparral. Eriogonum auriculatum is an important species for local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
