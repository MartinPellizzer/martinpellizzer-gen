    "intro": "Elaeoselinum asclepium subsp. millefolium, commonly known as the common yarrow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, gray-green leaves that are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
