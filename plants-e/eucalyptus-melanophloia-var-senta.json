    "intro": "Eucalyptus melanophloia var. senta, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically has smooth, greyish-white bark on younger trunks and develops rough, fibrous bark with age. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, globular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. This variety is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
