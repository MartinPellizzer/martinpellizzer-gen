    "intro": "Euonymus trichocarpus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive orange-red berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. The species is also valued for its tolerance to various soil types and its ability to form dense ground cover."
