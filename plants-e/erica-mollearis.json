    "intro": "Erica mollearis, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the winter months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the nutrient-poor soils typical of its natural habitat. Erica mollearis is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
