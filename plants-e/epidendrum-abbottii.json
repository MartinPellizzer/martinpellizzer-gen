    "intro": "Epidendrum abbottii, commonly known as the Abbott's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Epidendrum abbottii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
