    "intro": "Euphorbia olowaluana var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features a compact, branching structure with smooth, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified floral structures characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to grow in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and upland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
