    "intro": "Euphorbia cespitosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spurge, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has slender, angular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
