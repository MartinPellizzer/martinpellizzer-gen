    "intro": "Euphorbia esula subsp. maglicensis, commonly known as the Magli\u010dan euphorbia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has smooth, often ribbed stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
