    "intro": "Einsteinia, commonly known as the star cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plants are characterized by their cylindrical or spherical stems and showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Einsteinia species are typically low-maintenance cacti that thrive in well-draining soil and full sun. They are popular in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and resilience."
