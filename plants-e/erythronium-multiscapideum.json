    "intro": "Erythronium multiscapideum, commonly known as the clustered dog's tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white, bell-shaped flowers with three petals and three sepals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is sensitive to environmental changes."
