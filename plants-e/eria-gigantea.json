    "intro": "Eria gigantea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, often displaying vibrant colors such as pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Eria gigantea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in traditional medicine in some cultures."
