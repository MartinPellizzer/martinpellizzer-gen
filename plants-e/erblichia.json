    "intro": "Erblichia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate appearance. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Erblichia thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found growing on the roots of trees. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species."
