    "intro": "Epipactis velutina, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a greenish-yellow hue and a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Epipactis velutina is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, humid climates."
