    "intro": "Erythrina vignei, commonly known as the red torch tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often armed with sharp spines. It produces elongated, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Erythrina vignei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
