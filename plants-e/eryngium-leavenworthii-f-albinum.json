    "intro": "Eryngium leavenworthii f. albinum, commonly known as the white thistle, is a rare variant of the common eryngium found in the central United States. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the species. The plant has spiny, grass-like leaves and produces spherical flower heads that are often mistaken for small, white balls. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
