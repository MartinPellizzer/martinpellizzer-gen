    "intro": "Epipactis \u00d7 liestalensis, commonly known as the hybrid early marsh helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is known for its ability to hybridize with other Epipactis species, leading to genetic diversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
