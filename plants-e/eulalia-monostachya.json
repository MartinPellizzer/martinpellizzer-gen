It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Eulalia monostachya is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and adaptability."
