    "intro": "Eucalyptus sepulcralis var. robusta, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a dull green upper surface and a whitish underside. It produces small, globular yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during spring. This species is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands."
