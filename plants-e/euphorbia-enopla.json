    "intro": "Euphorbia enopla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
