    "intro": "Eragrostis riparia, commonly known as rivergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist soils along streams, rivers, and marshes, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. It is adapted to periodic flooding and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Eragrostis riparia plays an important role in maintaining ecosystem health by preventing erosion and providing habitat for wildlife."
