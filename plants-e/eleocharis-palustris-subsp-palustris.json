    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris subsp. palustris, commonly known as marsh needlegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and swampy areas. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
