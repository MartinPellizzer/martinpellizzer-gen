It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
