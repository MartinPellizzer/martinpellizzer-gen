    "intro": "Epidendrum diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its two distinct leaf types, with the lower leaves being broader and the upper ones more elongated. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique foliage and elegant floral display."
