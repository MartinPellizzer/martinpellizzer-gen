    "intro": "Ehretia pilosula, commonly known as the silky ehretia, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
