    "intro": "Epidendrum madrense, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1o Epidendrum, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant typically features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
