    "intro": "Euphorbia zakamenae, commonly known as the Zakamensk spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features a short, thick stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal rainfall and high temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
