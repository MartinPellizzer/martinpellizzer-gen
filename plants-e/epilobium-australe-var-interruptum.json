It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features slender, often reddish stems with opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are often covered with fine, soft hairs, and it is adapted to a variety of soil types, including wet or boggy conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for native wildlife."
