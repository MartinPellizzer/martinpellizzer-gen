    "intro": "Euphorbia ludoviciana, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to arid environments, storing water to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits known as figs. Its spiny stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Euphorbia ludoviciana is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens."
