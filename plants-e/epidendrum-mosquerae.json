    "intro": "Epidendrum mosquerae, commonly known as the Mosquera orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and bloom during the warmer months. Epidendrum mosquerae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
