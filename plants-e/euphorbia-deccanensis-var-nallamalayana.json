It is characterized by its branching stems covered in a thick layer of pale greenish-white latex, which is a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
