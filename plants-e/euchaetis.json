    "intro": "Euchaetis, commonly known as the goldenrods, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their showy yellow or golden flowers. Euchaetis species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to support local wildlife."
