    "intro": "Erodium praecox var. primulaceum, commonly known as the common stinkcup, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Portulacaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
