It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are covered in fine hairs. Ebnerella trichacantha is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
