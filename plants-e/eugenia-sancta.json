    "intro": "Eugenia sancta, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or ara\u00e7\u00e1-do-brejo, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Eugenia sancta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
