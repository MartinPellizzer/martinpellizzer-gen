    "intro": "Ericoides minus, commonly known as the lesser heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed, contributing to its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring. Ericoides minus thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
