It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with a pinkish or reddish hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange or yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
