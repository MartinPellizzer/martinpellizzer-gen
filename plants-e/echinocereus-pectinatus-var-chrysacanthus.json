    "intro": "Echinocereus pectinatus var. chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branching structure composed of cylindrical stems that are typically green to yellowish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
