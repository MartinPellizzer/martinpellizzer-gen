    "intro": "Euphrasia paludosa, commonly known as bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in marshy or swampy environments. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its showy blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Euphrasia paludosa is often found in association with other wetland flora and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
