    "intro": "Eriophorum microstachyum, commonly known as the lesser cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and bogs in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton balls, which are produced in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated habitats. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
