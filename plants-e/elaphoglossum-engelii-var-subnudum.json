    "intro": "Elaphoglossum engelii var. subnudum, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often slightly curved. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
