    "intro": "Echites ptarmicus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the dry season. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in harsh environments. Echites ptarmicus is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
