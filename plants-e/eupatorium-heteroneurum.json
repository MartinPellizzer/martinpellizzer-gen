    "intro": "Eupatorium heteroneurum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its common name reflects the appearance of its stiff, angular leaves and its historical use in traditional medicine."
