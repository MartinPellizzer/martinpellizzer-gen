    "intro": "Elymus atratus, commonly known as black wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, slightly bluish leaves and tufted inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Elymus atratus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
