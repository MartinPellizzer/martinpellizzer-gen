    "intro": "Erigeron deminutus, commonly known as the dwarf fleabane, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring delicate, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant has fine, hairy leaves and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators. Erigeron deminutus is also valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
