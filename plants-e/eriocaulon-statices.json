    "intro": "Eriocaulon statices, commonly known as the marsh pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its roots help stabilize the soil, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Eriocaulon statices is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
