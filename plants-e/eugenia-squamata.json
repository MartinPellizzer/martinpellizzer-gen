    "intro": "Eugenia squamata, commonly known as the silver-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
