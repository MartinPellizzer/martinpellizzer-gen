It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in heathlands and open forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are clustered in spikes, attracting a variety of pollinators. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
