    "intro": "Escallonia piurensis, commonly known as the Piura escallonia, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Escalloniaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade. Escallonia piurensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife."
