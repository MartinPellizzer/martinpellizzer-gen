    "intro": "Eupatorium denticulatum, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, coarsely toothed leaves and produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clustered inflorescences. It blooms from late summer into early fall, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Eupatorium denticulatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
