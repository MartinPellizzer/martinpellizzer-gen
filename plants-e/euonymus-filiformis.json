    "intro": "Euonymus filiformis, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are usually dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
