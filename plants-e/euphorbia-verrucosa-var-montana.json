    "intro": "Euphorbia verrucosa var. montana, commonly known as the Montane Spiny Cushion, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a low-growing cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
