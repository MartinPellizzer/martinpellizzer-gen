It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. This plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
