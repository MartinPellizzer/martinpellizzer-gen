    "intro": "Epidendrum cartilaginiflorum, commonly known as the cartilage-flowered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fleshy, cartilage-like petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it blooms in the summer months. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
