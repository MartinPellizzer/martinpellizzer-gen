It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are the characteristic structures of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its fibrous roots help it survive in harsh environmental conditions."
