    "intro": "Euphorbia stictospora var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Texas. It features thick, ribbed stems covered in spiny, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, with modified structures that aid in water conservation. This variety is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
