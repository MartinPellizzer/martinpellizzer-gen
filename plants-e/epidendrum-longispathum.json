    "intro": "Epidendrum longispathum, commonly known as the long-spurred epidendron, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy pseudobulbs and long, slender leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, with distinctive spurred petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Epidendrum longispathum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
