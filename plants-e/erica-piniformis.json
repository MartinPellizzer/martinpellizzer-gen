    "intro": "Erica piniformis, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are dense and form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica piniformis is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
