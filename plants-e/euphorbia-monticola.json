    "intro": "Euphorbia monticola, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Euphorbia monticola is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
