    "intro": "Epipactis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex root system and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Epipactis lancifolia is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local biodiversity through its pollination and habitat value."
