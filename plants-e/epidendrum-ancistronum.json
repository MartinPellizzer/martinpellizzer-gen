    "intro": "Epidendrum ancistronum, commonly known as the Crimson Lip Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, vividly colored flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Epidendrum ancistronum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
