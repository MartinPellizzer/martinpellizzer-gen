    "intro": "Esenbeckia grandiflora subsp. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the small-leaf esenbeckia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, ovate leaves with a short petiole. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and modest flowering."
