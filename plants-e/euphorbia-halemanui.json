    "intro": "Euphorbia halemanui, commonly known as the Halemanu euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
