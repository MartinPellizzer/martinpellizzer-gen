    "intro": "Echinocarpus brassii, commonly known as the African burr or wild burr, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive spiny fruits. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Echinocarpus brassii typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
