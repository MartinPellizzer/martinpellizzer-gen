    "intro": "Erophila boerhaavii, commonly known as Boerhaave's waterplantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its scientific name honors the 17th-century Dutch physician and botanist Herman Boerhaave. Erophila boerhaavii plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and birds."
