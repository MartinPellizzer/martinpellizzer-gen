    "intro": "Epidendrum phlebonocturnum, commonly known as the night-flowering epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, night-blooming flowers that typically open in the evening. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for collectors interested in nocturnal flora. The species is relatively easy to care for, making it a suitable option for intermediate orchid growers."
