    "intro": "Euonymus alatus f. ciliatodentatus, commonly known as the winged euonymus, is a variant of the species Euonymus alatus, characterized by its distinctive winged stems and foliage. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that attract birds. The f. ciliatodentatus form is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaf teeth, adding to its ornamental value in horticulture."
