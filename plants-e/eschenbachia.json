    "intro": "Eschenbachia, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Urticaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite, often heart-shaped leaves and the presence of stinging hairs on their stems and leaves, similar to true nettles. Eschenbachia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences. The genus includes several species, such as Eschenbachia aculeata, which is known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
