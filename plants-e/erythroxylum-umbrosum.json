    "intro": "Erythroxylum umbrosum, commonly known as the dark red coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine, in its leaves. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
