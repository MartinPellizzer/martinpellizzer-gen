    "intro": "Elaphoglossum perangustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huperzia, is a small fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity and ecological adaptation."
