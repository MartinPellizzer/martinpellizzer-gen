    "intro": "Eriosema batekense, commonly known as the Batek's eriosema, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
