    "intro": "Eria sicaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, fleshy stem and produces small, green leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
