    "intro": "Euphorbia striata, commonly known as the zigzag euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem with a zigzag appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant has small, green, ovate leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia striata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
