    "intro": "Eugenia zenkeri, commonly known as the African evergreen or zenker's eugenia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red when mature, though they are not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Eugenia zenkeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
