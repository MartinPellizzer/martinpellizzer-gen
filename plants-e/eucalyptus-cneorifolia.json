    "intro": "Eucalyptus cneorifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in strips, and it is adapted to dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus cneorifolia plays an important role in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
