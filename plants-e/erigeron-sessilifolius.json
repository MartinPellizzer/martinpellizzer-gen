    "intro": "Erigeron sessilifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it produces small, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Erigeron sessilifolius is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological value and ornamental appeal."
