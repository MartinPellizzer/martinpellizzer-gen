It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure, with showy, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
