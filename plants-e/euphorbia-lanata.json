    "intro": "Euphorbia lanata, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils. However, it can be invasive in some areas and may cause skin irritation upon contact."
