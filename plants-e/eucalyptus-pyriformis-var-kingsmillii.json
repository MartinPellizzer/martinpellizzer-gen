    "intro": "Eucalyptus pyriformis var. kingsmillii, commonly known as the King's Mill's box gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels off in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The species produces small, globular flower buds that are typically green or yellowish-green, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
