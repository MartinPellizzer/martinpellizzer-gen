    "intro": "Echites almadensis, commonly known as the Almaden thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous, woody capsule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
