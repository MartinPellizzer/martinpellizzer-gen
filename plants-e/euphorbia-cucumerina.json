It features thick, ribbed stems and leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems. Euphorbia cucumerina is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
