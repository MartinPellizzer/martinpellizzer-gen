    "intro": "Epilobium numidicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and appear in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Epilobium numidicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet environments."
