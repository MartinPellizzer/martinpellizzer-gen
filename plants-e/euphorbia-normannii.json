    "intro": "Euphorbia normannii, commonly known as the Normann's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates."
