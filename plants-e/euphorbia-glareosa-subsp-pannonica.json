    "intro": "Euphorbia glareosa subsp. pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southeastern Europe. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
