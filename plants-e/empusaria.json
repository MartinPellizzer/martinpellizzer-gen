    "intro": "Empusaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, leafless appearance. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks true leaves and roots. Empusaria produces delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, moist environments. Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species."
