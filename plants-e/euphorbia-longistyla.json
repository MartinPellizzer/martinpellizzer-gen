    "intro": "Euphorbia longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and is adapted to store water in its thick stems. Euphorbia longistyla is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
