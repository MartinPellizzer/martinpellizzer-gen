    "intro": "Euphorbia randrianijohanyi, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar. It features a short, thick stem with a distinctive crown of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
