    "intro": "Ephedra saxatilis, commonly known as the rock ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and reddish-brown seeds, typically found in clusters. Ephedra saxatilis is adapted to survive in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Its structure and growth habits make it a hardy species well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
