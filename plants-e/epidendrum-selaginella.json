    "intro": "Epidendrum selaginella, commonly known as the Selaginella Epidendrum, is a unique hybrid plant that combines characteristics of both the orchid genus Epidendrum and the spiky, club-moss-like Selaginella. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, featuring multiple stems that arise from a rhizome. The plant produces intricate inflorescences with showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Epidendrum selaginella thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
