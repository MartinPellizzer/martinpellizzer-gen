It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
