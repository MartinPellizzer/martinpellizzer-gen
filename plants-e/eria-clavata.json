    "intro": "Eria clavata, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, brightly colored flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive clavate (club-shaped) spur. Eria clavata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
