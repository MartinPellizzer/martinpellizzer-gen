    "intro": "Erodium maritimum var. genuinum, commonly known as the coastal stork's bill, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed coastal habitats. Its name is derived from the shape of its seed pods, which resemble a stork's bill."
