    "intro": "Echinocactus jenischianus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry grasslands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of yellow spines, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. It is a slow-growing cactus that requires minimal water and is well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and collections."
