    "intro": "Erepsia levis, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Erepsia levis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat."
