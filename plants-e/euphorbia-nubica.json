    "intro": "Euphorbia nubica, commonly known as the cloud euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by greenish bracts. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Euphorbia nubica is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
