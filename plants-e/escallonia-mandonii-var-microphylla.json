    "intro": "Escallonia mandonii var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved escallonia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to South America. It features dense, glossy green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically no larger than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by red berries. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering display."
