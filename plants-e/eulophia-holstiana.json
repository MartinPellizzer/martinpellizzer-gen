    "intro": "Eulophia holstiana, commonly known as the Holst's orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Malaysia and Indonesia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow pseudobulbs and produces striking, showy inflorescences with numerous fragrant flowers. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. Eulophia holstiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
