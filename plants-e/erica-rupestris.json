    "intro": "Erica rupestris, commonly known as the rock heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Erica rupestris is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
