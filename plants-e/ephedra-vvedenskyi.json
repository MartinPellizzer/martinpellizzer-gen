    "intro": "Ephedra vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub native to arid regions of China. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many countries."
