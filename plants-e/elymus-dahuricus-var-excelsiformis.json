    "intro": "Elymus dahuricus var. excelsiformis, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, tufted stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, two-rowed flowers. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
