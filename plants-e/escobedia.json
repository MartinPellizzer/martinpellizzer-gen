    "intro": "Escobedia, commonly known as the \"tree of life,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. Escobedia species are characterized by their branched, tree-like structures with dense clusters of small, spiny stems. They produce vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to their unique appearance and ecological importance, some species of Escobedia are also cultivated as ornamental plants."
