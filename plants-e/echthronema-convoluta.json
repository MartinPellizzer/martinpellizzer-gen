    "intro": "Echthronema convoluta, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of fronds, which gives it a distinctive and often ornamental appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor, forming dense mats. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in shaded environments. Echthronema convoluta is often found in temperate rainforests, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions."
