    "intro": "Ereicoctis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to thrive on the bark of trees, making it an epiphyte. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Ereicoctis is known for its unique appearance and is often considered a symbol of botanical rarity. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as an endangered species."
