    "intro": "Eriocaulon brevipedunculatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in consistently moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to other varieties within the same species."
