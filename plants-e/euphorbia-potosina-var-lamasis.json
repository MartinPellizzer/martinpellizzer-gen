    "intro": "Euphorbia potosina var. lamasis, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures, surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to tolerate poor soil and full sun."
