    "intro": "Echinopsis tacaquirensis subsp. taquimbalensis, commonly known as the Taquimbalensis Cactus, is a rare and striking species native to the arid regions of northern Peru. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
