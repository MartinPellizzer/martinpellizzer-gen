    "intro": "Epidendrum utriculatum, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, inflated pseudobulbs that resemble bladders, hence its common name. The plant typically produces showy, violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Epidendrum utriculatum is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it forms dense colonies."
