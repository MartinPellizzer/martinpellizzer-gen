    "intro": "Euphorbia saturejoides, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
