    "intro": "Eriococcus caudatus, commonly known as the woolly apple aphid, is a small, soft-bodied insect that belongs to the family Aphididae. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly wax coating that covers its entire body, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant pest primarily infests apple trees and other members of the Rosaceae family, feeding on sap from new growth. The wax secretions can cause leaf curling and deformation, affecting plant health and fruit development. Due to its economic impact, it is a significant concern for orchard growers worldwide."
