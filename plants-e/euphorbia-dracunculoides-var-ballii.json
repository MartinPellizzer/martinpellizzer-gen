    "intro": "Euphorbia dracunculoides var. ballii, commonly known as the Ball's Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
