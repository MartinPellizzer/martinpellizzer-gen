    "intro": "Elaeocarpus samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan satinwood, is a tropical tree native to the islands of Samoa and American Samoa. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers followed by distinctive, woody, spherical fruits that are typically red or purple when mature. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
