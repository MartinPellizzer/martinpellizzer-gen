    "intro": "Eucalyptus rupicola, commonly known as the rock eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that can range from grey to white in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a distinctive aromatic scent. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. This species is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
