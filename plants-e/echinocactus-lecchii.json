    "intro": "Echinocactus lecchii, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiky appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Echinocactus lecchii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
