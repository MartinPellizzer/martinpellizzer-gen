    "intro": "Elaeocarpus tuberculatus, commonly known as the knobwood or tuberculate elaeocarpus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Elaeocarpus tuberculatus is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. It also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
