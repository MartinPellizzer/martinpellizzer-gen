It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams. It reproduces through spores and is a relic from the Paleozoic era, showcasing ancient evolutionary traits. The plant's structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
