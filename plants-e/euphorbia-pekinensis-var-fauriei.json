    "intro": "Euphorbia pekinensis var. fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a succulent shrub native to China. It features distinctive, bright orange, lantern-shaped cyathia that are clustered along its stems. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. The cyathia contain a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, so care should be taken when handling the plant."
