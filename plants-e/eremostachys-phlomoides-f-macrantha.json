    "intro": "Eremostachys phlomoides f. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered eremostachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in grayish-green, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched inflorescences with violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
