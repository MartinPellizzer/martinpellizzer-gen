    "intro": "Eriogonum truncatum var. adsurgens, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range."
