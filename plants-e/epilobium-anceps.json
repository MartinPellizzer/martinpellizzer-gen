    "intro": "Epilobium anceps, commonly known as the purple marsh willow-herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, riverbanks, and ditches. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Epilobium anceps is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
