    "intro": "Elaeagnus kiusiana, commonly known as the Japanese silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Elaeagnus kiusiana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
