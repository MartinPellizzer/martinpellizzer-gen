    "intro": "Echinocereus ferreirianus var. lindsayi, commonly known as Lindsay's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-covered cactus with a compact, rounded shape. The plant features clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
