    "intro": "Erigeron mogollonicus, commonly known as the Mogollon blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water conservation. Erigeron mogollonicus is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
