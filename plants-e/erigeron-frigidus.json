    "intro": "Erigeron frigidus, commonly known as the arctic fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Erigeron frigidus produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
