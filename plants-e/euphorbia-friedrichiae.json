    "intro": "Euphorbia friedrichiae, commonly known as the Friedrich's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Euphorbia friedrichiae is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
