It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines.
