    "intro": "Escallonia rahmeri var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed escallonia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal floral display."
