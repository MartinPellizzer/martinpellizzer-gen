    "intro": "Euphorbia brachycera f. dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, green stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
