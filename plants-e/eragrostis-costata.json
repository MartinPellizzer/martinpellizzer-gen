    "intro": "Eragrostis costata, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Eragrostis costata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
