    "intro": "Eucalyptus coriacea var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine rough-barked gum, is a variant of the rough-barked gum native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as heathlands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in cooler, drier conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a greyish-green hue, and it produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow. This variant is well adapted to high-altitude environments and plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
