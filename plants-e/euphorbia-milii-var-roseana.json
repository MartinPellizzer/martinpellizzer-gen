    "intro": "Euphorbia milii var. roseana, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true blooms. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation."
