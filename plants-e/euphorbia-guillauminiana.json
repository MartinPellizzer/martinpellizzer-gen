It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap, which can be toxic. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid environments."
