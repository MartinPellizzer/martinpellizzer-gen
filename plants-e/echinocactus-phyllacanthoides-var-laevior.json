    "intro": "Echinocactus phyllacanthoides var. laevior, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, and it is adapted to thrive in full sun with minimal water. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in drought conditions."
