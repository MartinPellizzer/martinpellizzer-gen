    "intro": "Eulophia venulosa, commonly known as the veined eulophia, is a herbaceous orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and often have a distinctive veined pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The flowers are usually yellow or green with purple or red markings, and they bloom in clusters during the warmer months."
