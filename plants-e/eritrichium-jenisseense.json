    "intro": "Eritrichium jenisseense, commonly known as the Jenise River bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and northern China. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its delicate blue or purple flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
