    "intro": "Eupatorium loxense, commonly known as the slender boneset, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its showy, pale blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eupatorium loxense is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
