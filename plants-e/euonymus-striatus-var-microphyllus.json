    "intro": "Euonymus striatus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover or as a border plant in gardens."
