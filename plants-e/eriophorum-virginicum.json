    "intro": "Eriophorum virginicum, commonly known as cottongrass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and tundra environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered at the base of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in moist or marshy habitats. Cottongrass plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
