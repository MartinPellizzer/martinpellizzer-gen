    "intro": "Euphorbia ovata, commonly known as the oval euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branching stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
