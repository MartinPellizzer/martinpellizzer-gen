    "intro": "Eschweilera kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's evergreen, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, with a dense canopy and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
