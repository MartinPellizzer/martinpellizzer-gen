    "intro": "Evolvulus wilcoxianus, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a trailing perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped blue to violet flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along trails. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
