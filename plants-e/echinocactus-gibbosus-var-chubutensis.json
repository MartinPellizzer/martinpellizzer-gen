It features a globular stem covered in bright green, spiny areoles with clusters of white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are followed by edible, red fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
