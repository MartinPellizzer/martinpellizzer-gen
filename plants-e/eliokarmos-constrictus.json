    "intro": "Eliokarmos constrictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf elokarmos, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies, particularly in the field of alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species with potential ecological significance."
