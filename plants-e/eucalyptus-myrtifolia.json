    "intro": "Eucalyptus myrtifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellow in color. Its bark is smooth and peels off in long, ribbon-like strips, revealing a mottled pattern of grey and green. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
