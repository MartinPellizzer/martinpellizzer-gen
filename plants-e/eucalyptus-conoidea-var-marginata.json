It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or pink at the edges.

It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
