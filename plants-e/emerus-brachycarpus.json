    "intro": "Emerus brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-seeded watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that contain its characteristic short, hard seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
