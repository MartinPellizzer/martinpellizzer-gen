    "intro": "Euphorbia oblongicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
