    "intro": "Euphorbia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
