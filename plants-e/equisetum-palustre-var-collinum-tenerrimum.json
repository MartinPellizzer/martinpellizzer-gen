    "intro": "Equisetum palustre var. collinum-tenerrimum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a variety of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
