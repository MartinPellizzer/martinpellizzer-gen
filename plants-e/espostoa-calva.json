    "intro": "Espostoa calva, commonly known as the white-flowered puya, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Espostoa calva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
