    "intro": "Euphorbia sieboldiana f. yezoensis, commonly known as the Yezo euphorbia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features a dense, rounded growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The plant's unique foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
