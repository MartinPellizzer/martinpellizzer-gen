    "intro": "Euphorbia pumicicola, commonly known as the pumice euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
