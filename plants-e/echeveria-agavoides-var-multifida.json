    "intro": "Echeveria agavoides var. multifida, commonly known as the Rosy Red Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically pink to reddish in color, especially when exposed to sunlight. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. This variety is prized for its compact growth habit and vibrant coloration, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
