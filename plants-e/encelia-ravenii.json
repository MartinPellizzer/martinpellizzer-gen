    "intro": "Encelia ravenii, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery, woolly leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical name honors the botanist John Ravenswood, and it is part of the Malvaceae family. Encelia ravenii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
