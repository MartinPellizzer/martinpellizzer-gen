    "intro": "Eriocaulon australe f. proliferum, commonly known as the Australian marsh grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. This variant is notable for its rapid vegetative propagation through rhizomes, contributing to its ability to form dense stands."
