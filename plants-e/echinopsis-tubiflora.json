    "intro": "Echinopsis tubiflora, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, ribbed structure helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Echinopsis tubiflora is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in cactus gardens."
