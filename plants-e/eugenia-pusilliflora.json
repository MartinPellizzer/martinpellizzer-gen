    "intro": "Eugenia pusilliflora, commonly known as the small-flowered eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, round, red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Eugenia pusilliflora is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
