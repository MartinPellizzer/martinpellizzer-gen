    "intro": "Esula dendroides, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, tree-like appearance. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil. Its rhizome system allows it to grow in various soil types, though it thrives in moist, well-drained environments. Esula dendroides plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
