    "intro": "Eucalyptus brachycalyx var. chindoo, commonly known as the Chindoo malleable, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Kimberley region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to grey pubescence. The flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and they are borne in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree produces small, woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat."
