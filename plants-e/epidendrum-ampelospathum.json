    "intro": "Epidendrum ampelospathum, commonly known as the hanging epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often as an epiphyte on trees or rocks. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blooms. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
