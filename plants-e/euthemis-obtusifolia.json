    "intro": "Euthemis obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved euphorbia, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence called a cyathium. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is adapted to survive in drought conditions. Euthemis obtusifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
