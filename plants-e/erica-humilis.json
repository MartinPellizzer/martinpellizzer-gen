    "intro": "Erica humilis, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters and features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. It produces small, dark blue-black berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Erica humilis is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
