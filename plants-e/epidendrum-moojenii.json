    "intro": "Epidendrum moojenii, commonly known as the Moonlight Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive green throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. Epidendrum moojenii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
