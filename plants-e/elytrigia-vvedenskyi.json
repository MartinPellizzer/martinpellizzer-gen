    "intro": "Elytrigia vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
