    "intro": "Ericoides modestum, commonly known as the modest ericoid, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are dark green and densely packed, forming a compact, mat-like structure. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring or early summer. Ericoides modestum is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
