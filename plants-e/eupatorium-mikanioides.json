The plant produces tiny, white to blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slight hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks."
