    "intro": "Empetrum nigrum var. asiaticum, commonly known as the Asian crowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of Asia. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. This variety is closely related to the common crowberry and shares similar ecological roles in its native environment."
