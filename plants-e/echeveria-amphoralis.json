It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with a powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant purple or pink flowers on tall, branched stems during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its compact form. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
