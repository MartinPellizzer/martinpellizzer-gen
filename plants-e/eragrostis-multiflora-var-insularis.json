    "intro": "Eragrostis multiflora var. insularis, commonly known as the island lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically pale green to golden in color. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a bluish-gray hue, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient plant in coastal and island habitats."
