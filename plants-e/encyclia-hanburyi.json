    "intro": "Encyclia hanburyi, commonly known as Hanbury's pineapple orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, pineapple-shaped inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat destruction, Encyclia hanburyi is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
