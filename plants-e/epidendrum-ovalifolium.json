    "intro": "Epidendrum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features upright, branching stems that bear numerous lance-shaped leaves with a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, showy lips. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum ovalifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
