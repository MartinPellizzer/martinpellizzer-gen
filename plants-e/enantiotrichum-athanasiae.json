    "intro": "Enantiotrichum athanasiae, commonly known as the black rot fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily affects ornamental plants, particularly those in the genus Kalmia. It is characterized by its ability to produce dark, necrotic lesions on leaves and stems, which can lead to significant defoliation and plant decline. The fungus thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often associated with poor air circulation and overwatering. It spreads through spores that are released from infected plant debris, making it a persistent challenge in botanical gardens and nurseries. Effective management involves cultural practices such as proper pruning, sanitation, and the use of resistant plant varieties."
