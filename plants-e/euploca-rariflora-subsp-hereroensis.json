It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. It has a low-growing habit and exhibits adaptations to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
