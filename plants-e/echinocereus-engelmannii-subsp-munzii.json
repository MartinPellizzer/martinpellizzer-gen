    "intro": "Echinocereus engelmannii subsp. munzii, commonly known as the Munz's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
