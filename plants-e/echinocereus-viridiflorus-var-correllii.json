    "intro": "Echinocereus viridiflorus var. correllii, commonly known as the green-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and bright green stems that can turn reddish in full sun. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in the spring, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
