    "intro": "Euonymus rotundatus, commonly known as the roundleaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red, inflated seed pods that persist into winter. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Euonymus rotundatus is valued in landscaping for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
