    "intro": "Elytrigia juncea var. sartorii, commonly known as Sartor's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairless stems that often lie flat on the ground. The leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green coloration, and the inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem. This variety is notable for its adaptability to moist, temperate climates and its use in ecological restoration projects. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its native habitats."
