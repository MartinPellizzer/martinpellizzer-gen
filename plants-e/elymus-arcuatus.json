It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves that curl at the tips, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. Elymus arcuatus has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
