    "intro": "Euphorbia rudis, commonly known as the rough spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a distinctive appearance with thick, ribbed stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance."
