    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green to brownish leaves and its distinctive two-toned flowers, which typically feature a dark purple or brown lower lip and a lighter upper lip. The plant is terrestrial, growing in moist, shaded woodlands and often forming dense colonies. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
