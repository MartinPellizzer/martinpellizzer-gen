    "intro": "Erica bequaertii, commonly known as the Cape rosemary, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Erica bequaertii thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
