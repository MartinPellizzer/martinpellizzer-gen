    "intro": "Entandrophragma macrophyllum, commonly known as the African teak, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne in clusters. The tree's heartwood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it a valuable timber species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many parts of its range."
