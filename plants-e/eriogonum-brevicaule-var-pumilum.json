    "intro": "Eriogonum brevicaule var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf bushmallow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in dry slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
