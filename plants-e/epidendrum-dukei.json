    "intro": "Epidendrum dukei, commonly known as the Duke's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, pendant-like inflorescences. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom sequentially along the stem. Epidendrum dukei is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal manner with new growths emerging from the base of the previous ones. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
