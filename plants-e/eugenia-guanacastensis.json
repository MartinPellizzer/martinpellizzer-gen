It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
