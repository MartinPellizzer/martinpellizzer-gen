    "intro": "Epidendrum robustum, commonly known as the robust epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-shaped,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Epidendrum robustum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor growers."
