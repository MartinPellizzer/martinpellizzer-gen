    "intro": "Eremophila vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves that are coated with a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for dry gardens. Eremophila vernicosa is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators."
