    "intro": "Eleusine coracana var. stricta, commonly known as finger millet, is a small-seeded annual grass native to Africa and cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are harvested for their nutritional value. It is well adapted to poor soils and drought conditions, making it an important crop in arid and semi-arid regions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, sturdy stem that supports its compact growth form."
