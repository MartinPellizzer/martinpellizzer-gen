    "intro": "Elymus pendulinus var. yezoensis, commonly known as the Yezo wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Its fibrous roots make it an important species for soil stabilization and ecological restoration projects."
