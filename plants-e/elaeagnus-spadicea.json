It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Elaeagnus spadicea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
