    "intro": "Epimeredi secundus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though its botanical study remains limited."
