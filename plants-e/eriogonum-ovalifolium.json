    "intro": "Eriogonum ovalifolium, commonly known as the ovalleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Eriogonum ovalifolium plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
