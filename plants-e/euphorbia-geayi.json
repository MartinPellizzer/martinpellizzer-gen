    "intro": "Euphorbia geayi, commonly known as the Zanzibar milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the Comoros Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
