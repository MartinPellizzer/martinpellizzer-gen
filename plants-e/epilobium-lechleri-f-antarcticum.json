It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
