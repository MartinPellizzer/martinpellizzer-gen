    "intro": "Ephedra arborea, commonly known as the tree ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its branching, woody structure and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Ephedra arborea is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its alkaloids, such as ephedrine, are now regulated due to their potential for misuse."
