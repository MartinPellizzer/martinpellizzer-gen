    "intro": "Eupatorium polyneuron, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, slender stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a misty appearance. Its showy blue to purple flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees. Eupatorium polyneuron is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
