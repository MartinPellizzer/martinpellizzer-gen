    "intro": "Euphorbia coccinea, commonly known as the red spurge or bloodroot, is a striking succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces vibrant red, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, so caution is advised when handling it. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a notable addition to arid landscapes."
