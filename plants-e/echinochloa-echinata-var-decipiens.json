    "intro": "Echinochloa echinata var. decipiens, commonly known as the false brome, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
