    "intro": "Echium aurelianum, commonly known as the golden evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Echium aurelianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
