    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 treleaseanum, commonly known as the hybrid willow herb, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Epilobium angustifolium (narrowleaf willow herb) and Epilobium palustre (marsh willow herb). The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy pink to red flowers in clusters. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration efforts."
