    "intro": "Echinopsis lecoriensis, commonly known as the Lecore\u2019s moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a short, thick stem and produces large, showy white flowers during the cooler months. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
