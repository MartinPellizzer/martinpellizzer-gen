    "intro": "Ericoides caledonicum, commonly known as the Caledonian heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moorland and mountainous regions. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces dark-colored berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ericoides caledonicum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat."
