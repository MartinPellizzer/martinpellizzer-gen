    "intro": "Ecbolium striatum var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ecbolium, is a lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive striated pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
