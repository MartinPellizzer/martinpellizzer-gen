    "intro": "Euplassa semicostata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, ribbed segments. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both aquatic and terrestrial phases, with spores produced on the underside of its fronds. It plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Euplassa semicostata is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands across temperate regions."
