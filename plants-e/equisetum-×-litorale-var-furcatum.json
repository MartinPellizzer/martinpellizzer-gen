    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale var. furcatum, commonly known as the sea screech. This variant is a hybrid of Equisetum litorale and Equisetum furcatum, characterized by its robust, sparsely branched stems that often grow in coastal or saline environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive appearance with whorls of small, needle-like leaves and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, where it thrives in moderate to high salinity conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
