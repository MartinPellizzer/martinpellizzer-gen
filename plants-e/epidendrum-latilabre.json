    "intro": "Epidendrum latilabre, commonly known as the broad-lipped epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects and birds. Epidendrum latilabre is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
