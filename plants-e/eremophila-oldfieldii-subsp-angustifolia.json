    "intro": "Eremophila oldfieldii subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for low-water gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
