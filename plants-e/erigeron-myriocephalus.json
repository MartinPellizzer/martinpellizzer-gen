    "intro": "Erigeron myriocephalus, commonly known as the blueweed or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces showy, blue-violet ray flowers surrounded by yellow disk flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and pond edges. Erigeron myriocephalus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
