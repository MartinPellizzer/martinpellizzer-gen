    "intro": "Eulophia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved eulophia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Eulophia obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
