    "intro": "Ephedra lepidosperma, commonly known as the slender ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is known for its medicinal properties, though its use is restricted due to the presence of ephedrine, a stimulant alkaloid. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Ephedra lepidosperma is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
