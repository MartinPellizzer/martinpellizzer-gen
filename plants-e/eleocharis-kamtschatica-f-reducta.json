    "intro": "Eleocharis kamtschatica f. reducta, commonly known as the compact spike-rush, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact inflorescence that forms a tight, spike-like structure. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its reduced floral structure compared to the typical form of Eleocharis kamtschatica."
