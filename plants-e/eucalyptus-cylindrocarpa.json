    "intro": "Eucalyptus cylindrocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are small and usually pale or white, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody, cylindrical capsules that contain the seeds. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of inland Australia. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
