    "intro": "Equisetum variegatum f. tortuosum, commonly known as the variegated horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of nodes and its distinctive, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in wetlands or along stream banks. This fern ally is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
