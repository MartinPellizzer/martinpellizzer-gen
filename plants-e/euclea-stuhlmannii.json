    "intro": "Euclea stuhlmannii, commonly known as the red-stemmed hakea, is a South African shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive red stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Euclea stuhlmannii is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
