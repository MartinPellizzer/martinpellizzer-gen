    "intro": "Eugenia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed eugenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, which are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round, and turn from green to red or purple as they mature. Eugenia oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its foliage and floral display."
