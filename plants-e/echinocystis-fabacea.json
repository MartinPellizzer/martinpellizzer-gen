    "intro": "Echinocystis fabacea, commonly known as the Brazilian cucumber or wild cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces large, green, spiny fruits that resemble cucumbers, with a rough, ridged exterior. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds dispersed by animals. Botanically, it belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes other cucurbit plants like pumpkins and watermelons."
