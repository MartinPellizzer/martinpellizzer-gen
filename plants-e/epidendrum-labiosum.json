    "intro": "Epidendrum labiosum, commonly known as the lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are showy, with bright colors and a distinctive lip-shaped petal that aids in pollination. Epidendrum labiosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under appropriate conditions."
