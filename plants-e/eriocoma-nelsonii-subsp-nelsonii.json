    "intro": "Eriocoma nelsonii subsp. nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's eriocoma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
