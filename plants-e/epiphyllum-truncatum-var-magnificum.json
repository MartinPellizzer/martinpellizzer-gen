    "intro": "Epiphyllum truncatum var. magnificum, commonly known as the magnificum night bloomer, is a hybrid cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that resemble leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
