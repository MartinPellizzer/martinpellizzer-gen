    "intro": "Eremophila gibbifolia, commonly known as the woolly emu bush, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its structure consists of multiple stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often fleshy and succulent. Eremophila gibbifolia is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
