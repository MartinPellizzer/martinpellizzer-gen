    "intro": "Eucalyptus saxatilis, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a greyish-green color. The flowers are small and white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and attract various pollinators."
