    "intro": "Elytrigia cognata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and other wetland habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Elytrigia cognata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
