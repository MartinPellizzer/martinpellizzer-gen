    "intro": "Eriobotrya tengyuehensis, commonly known as the Tengyue loquat, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange to yellow berries in late summer. These berries are edible, though they are generally considered less flavorful compared to other loquat varieties. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
