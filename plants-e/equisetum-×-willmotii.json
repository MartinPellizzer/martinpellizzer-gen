    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 willmotii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile plant that results from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum palustre. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its lack of true roots and its ability to spread vegetatively, it is a persistent and resilient species in its native habitat."
