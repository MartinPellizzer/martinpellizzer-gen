    "intro": "Eleocharis andamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman spike rush, is a species of sedge native to the Andaman Islands. It is a perennial plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments, thriving in shallow water or moist soil. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among sedges."
