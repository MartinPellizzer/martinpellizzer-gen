    "intro": "Encyclia leopardina, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spotted leaves that resemble a leopard's coat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a mix of white, yellow, and green hues, often with a dark central stripe. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Encyclia leopardina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
