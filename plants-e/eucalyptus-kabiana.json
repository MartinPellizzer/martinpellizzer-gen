    "intro": "Eucalyptus kabiana, commonly known as the Kabianga gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of north-eastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically glaucous and have a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus kabiana is a valuable component of its native ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land-use impacts."
