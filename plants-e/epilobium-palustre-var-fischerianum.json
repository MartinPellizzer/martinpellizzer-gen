    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. fischerianum, commonly known as the Fischer\u2019s willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs, typically ranging from 2 to 6 cm in length. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spike-like clusters, and bloom from June to August. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more slender growth habit and slightly different floral morphology."
