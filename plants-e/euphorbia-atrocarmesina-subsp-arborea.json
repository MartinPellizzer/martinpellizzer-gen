    "intro": "Euphorbia atrocarmesina subsp. arborea, commonly known as the tree euphorbia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and sparse, often spiny foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
