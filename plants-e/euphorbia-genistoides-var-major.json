    "intro": "Euphorbia genistoides var. major, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its latex-containing sap, which can be toxic. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
