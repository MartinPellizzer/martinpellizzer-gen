    "intro": "Eurya japonica var. phyllanthoides, commonly known as Japanese holly or Japanese waxleaf, is a compact evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is valued in horticulture for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. This variety is often used as a ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
