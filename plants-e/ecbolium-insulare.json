    "intro": "Ecbolium insulare, commonly known as the island ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island environments. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ecbolium insulare is considered endangered in many regions."
