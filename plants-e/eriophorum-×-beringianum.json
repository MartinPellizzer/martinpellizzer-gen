    "intro": "Eriophorum \u00d7 beringianum, commonly known as the Beringian cottongrass, is a hybrid plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stalks. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and bogs, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these fragile ecosystems. The plant is also an important food source for various herbivores, including reindeer and lemmings."
