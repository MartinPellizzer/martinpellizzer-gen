    "intro": "Euphorbia subsalsa subsp. fluvialis, commonly known as the river euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, a common feature among the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain water in moist environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil along aquatic habitats."
