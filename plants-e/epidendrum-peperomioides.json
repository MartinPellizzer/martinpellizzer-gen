    "intro": "Epidendrum peperomioides, commonly known as the Peperomia-like Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum peperomioides is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardeners."
