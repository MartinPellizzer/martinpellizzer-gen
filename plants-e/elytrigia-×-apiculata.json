    "intro": "Elytrigia \u00d7 apiculata, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Elytrigia repens and Elytrigia calycina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread."
