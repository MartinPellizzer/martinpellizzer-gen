    "intro": "Elymus alaskanus subsp. scandicus, commonly known as Alaska bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in cooler climates. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or blue. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
