    "intro": "Eleutherococcus rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined eleuthero, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are distinctive for their prominent, reddish veins, which give it its common name. Eleutherococcus rufinervis is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties."
