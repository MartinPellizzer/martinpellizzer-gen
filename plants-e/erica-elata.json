It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Erica elata thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh, cold climates."
