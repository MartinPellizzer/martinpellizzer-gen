    "intro": "Eucephalus ledophyllus, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Eucephalus ledophyllus is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
