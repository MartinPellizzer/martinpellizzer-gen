    "intro": "Epilobium humile, commonly known as narrowleaf willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Epilobium humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and serves as a food source for various pollinators."
