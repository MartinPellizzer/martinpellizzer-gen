    "intro": "Eleocharis klingei, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense clusters of slender, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Eleocharis klingei is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic biodiversity."
