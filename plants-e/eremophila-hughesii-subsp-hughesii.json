It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces spikes of pale blue or purple flowers during spring. It is well-suited for drought-tolerant landscaping and is often used in revegetation projects. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
