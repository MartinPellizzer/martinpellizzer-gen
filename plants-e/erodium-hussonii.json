    "intro": "Erodium hussonii, commonly known as the Hooker's bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its seed pods split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
