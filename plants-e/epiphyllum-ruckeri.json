    "intro": "Epiphyllum ruckeri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Epiphyllum ruckeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking floral display and relatively easy care requirements."
