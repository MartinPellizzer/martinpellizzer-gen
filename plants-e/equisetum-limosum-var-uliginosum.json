    "intro": "Equisetum limosum var. uliginosum, commonly known as the swamp scouringrush, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This plant is typically found in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It lacks true leaves and instead has microphylls, which are small, scale-like structures. Equisetum limosum var. uliginosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used as a bioindicator for wetland health."
