    "intro": "Euphorbia strigosa, commonly known as the rough spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green stems and leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Euphorbia strigosa is a hardy plant that is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
