    "intro": "Echinopsis tarijensis subsp. bertramiana, commonly known as the Bertram's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a globular shape, often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental value. This subspecies is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water."
