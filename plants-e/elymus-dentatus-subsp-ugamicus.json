    "intro": "Elymus dentatus subsp. ugamicus, commonly known as the Mongolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with small, awned florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and sandy soils, and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems in its native range."
