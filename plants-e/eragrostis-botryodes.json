    "intro": "Eragrostis botryodes, commonly known as the clustered false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eragrostis botryodes is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
