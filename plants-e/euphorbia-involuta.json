    "intro": "Euphorbia involuta, commonly known as the curly spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spirally twisted stems and leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant."
