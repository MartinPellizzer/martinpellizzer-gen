    "intro": "Euphorbia brasiliensis var. paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
