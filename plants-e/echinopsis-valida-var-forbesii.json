    "intro": "Echinopsis valida var. forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rounded, ribbed stems and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant."
