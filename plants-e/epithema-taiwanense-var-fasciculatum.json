It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited distribution."
