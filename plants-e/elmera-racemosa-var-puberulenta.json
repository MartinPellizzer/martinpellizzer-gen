    "intro": "Elmera racemosa var. puberulenta, commonly known as the pubescent evergreen holly, is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy leaves. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a leathery texture and a pubescent (hairy) underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. This plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide winter interest."
