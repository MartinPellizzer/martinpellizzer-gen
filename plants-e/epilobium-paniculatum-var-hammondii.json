    "intro": "Epilobium paniculatum var. hammondii, commonly known as Hammond's willowherb, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and streambanks. The plant features showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Epilobium paniculatum."
