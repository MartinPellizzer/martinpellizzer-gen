    "intro": "Enslenia cinerea, commonly known as the gray sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grayish-green, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Enslenia cinerea plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
