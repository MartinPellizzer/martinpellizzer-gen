It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a white, milky sap. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Euphorbia terracina is also known for its toxic properties, making it a plant to handle with care."
