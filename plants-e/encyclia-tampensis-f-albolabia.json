    "intro": "Encyclia tampensis f. albolabia, commonly known as the white-labied pineapple orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, with prominent white labellum that distinguishes this form. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a notable early-season orchid. The species is adapted to grow on trees in humid, shaded environments, often in the Florida panhandle and along the Gulf Coast."
