    "intro": "Epilobium \u00d7 brevipilum nothosubsp. brevipilum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow herb, is a hybrid species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streambanks and wet meadows. This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
