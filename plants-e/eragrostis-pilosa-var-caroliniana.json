    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa var. caroliniana, commonly known as Carolina false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
