    "intro": "Echinolytrum dipsaceum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble a crown of thorns. The plant has silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along cliffs and shorelines. Echinolytrum dipsaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
