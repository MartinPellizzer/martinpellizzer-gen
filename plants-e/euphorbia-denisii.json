    "intro": "Euphorbia denisii, commonly known as the Denis's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Euphorbia denisii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
