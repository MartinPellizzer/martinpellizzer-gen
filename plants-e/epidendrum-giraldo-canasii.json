    "intro": "Epidendrum giraldo-canasii, commonly known as the Giraldo-Canas Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It has lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a fine, silky texture. This orchid thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light."
