    "intro": "Eucnemis, commonly known as the green lacewing, is a genus of insects belonging to the family Chrysopidae. These insects are characterized by their delicate, lace-like wings and elongated bodies. They are often found in gardens and agricultural areas where they play a beneficial role as predators of aphids and other small pests. The larvae, known as \"aphid lions,\" are particularly effective in controlling pest populations. Eucnemis species are important in biological control programs due to their natural predation behavior."
