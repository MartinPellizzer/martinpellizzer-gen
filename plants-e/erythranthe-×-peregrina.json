    "intro": "Erythranthe \u00d7 peregrina, commonly known as the hybrid monkeyflower, is a member of the Physciaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Erythranthe cardinalis and Erythranthe lutea, contributing to its genetic diversity. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
