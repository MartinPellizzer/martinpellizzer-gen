    "intro": "Echinochloa paracorvi, commonly known as the paracorvi grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is typically annual, with a short life cycle that allows it to thrive in disturbed or moist soils. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
