    "intro": "Eucalyptus foecunda subsp. aeolica, commonly known as the coastal mallee, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland arid environments. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
