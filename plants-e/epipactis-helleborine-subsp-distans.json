    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine subsp. distans, commonly known as the distant helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. This subspecies typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. It is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
