    "intro": "Echinomastus acunensis, commonly known as the Andean spineflower, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for minimizing water loss in its harsh environment. Echinomastus acunensis is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in full sun."
