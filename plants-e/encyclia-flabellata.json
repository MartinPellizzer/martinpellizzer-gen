    "intro": "Encyclia flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive flabellate (fan-shaped) lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers typically bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and greenhouses. Encyclia flabellata is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
