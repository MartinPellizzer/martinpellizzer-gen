    "intro": "Encyclia tampensis, commonly known as the Florida lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in wetlands and pine rocklands, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a showy appearance that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
