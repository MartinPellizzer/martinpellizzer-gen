    "intro": "Euphorbia tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovarensis spurges, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a distinctive appearance with a short, thick stem and fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
