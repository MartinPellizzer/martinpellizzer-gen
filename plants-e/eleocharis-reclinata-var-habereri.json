    "intro": "Eleocharis reclinata var. habereri, commonly known as the Habereri spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikes of tiny flowers that are often clustered in dense, grass-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in marshy areas. The species is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
