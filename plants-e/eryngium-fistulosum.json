    "intro": "Eryngium fistulosum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the flowers appear in late summer to early autumn. Eryngium fistulosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
