    "intro": "Euphorbia septentrionalis subsp. gamugofana, commonly known as the Northern Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a spiny appearance due to the presence of short, sharp spines along its stems. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xerophytic gardens."
