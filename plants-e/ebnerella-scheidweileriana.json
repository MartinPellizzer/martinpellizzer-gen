    "intro": "Ebnerella scheidweileriana, commonly known as the Schiedweiler's starwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, green, spirally arranged leaves that help it float on the water's surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by small, elliptical fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
