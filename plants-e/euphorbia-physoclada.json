    "intro": "Euphorbia physoclada, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green\u82b1\u6735, which are actually modified inflorescences called cyathia. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Euphorbia physoclada is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
