    "intro": "Echinella, commonly known as the \"pincushion plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its dense, spiny bracts that resemble a pincushion, giving it its common name. These bracts are usually bright yellow or orange and serve to protect the small, inconspicuous flowers. Echinella species are typically found in dry, rocky habitats and are native to regions of southern Africa. The plant's structure is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking member of the Asteraceae family."
