    "intro": "Epidendrum sigmostachyum, commonly known as the golden spike epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Epidendrum sigmostachyum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
