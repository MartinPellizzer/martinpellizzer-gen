    "intro": "Elytroblepharum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers that often resemble sea urchins. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish or greyish hue that helps them reflect sunlight. Elytroblepharum species are often found in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate saline conditions."
