    "intro": "Encholirium spectabile, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Encholirium spectabile is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens for its dramatic appearance."
