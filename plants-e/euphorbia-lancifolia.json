    "intro": "Euphorbia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences rather than true flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
