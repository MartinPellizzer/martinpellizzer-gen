    "intro": "Epipactis atrorubens subvar. suboppositifolia, commonly known as the dark red helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme. The leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture, and they are usually arranged in two rows along the stem. This subvariety is distinguished by its subopposite leaf arrangement, which sets it apart from other varieties of Epipactis. It prefers moist, shaded habitats and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
