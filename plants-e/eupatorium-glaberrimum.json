    "intro": "Eupatorium glaberrimum, commonly known as roughside eupatorium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Eupatorium glaberrimum is often found in wetland ecosystems and can serve as a host plant for certain insects."
