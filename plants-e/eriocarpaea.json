    "intro": "Eriocarpaea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy, velvety leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Eriocarpaea species are annual or perennial herbs that produce capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and birds."
