    "intro": "Epidendrum maldonadoense, commonly known as the Maldonado's Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant typically features long, narrow leaves and produces inflorescences with showy, colorful flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
