    "intro": "Eucalyptus viminalis nothosubsp. hentyensis, commonly known as the Henty's malleable gum, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and grey. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically cream to pale yellow in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
