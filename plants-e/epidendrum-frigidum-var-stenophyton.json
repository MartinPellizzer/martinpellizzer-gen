    "intro": "Epidendrum frigidum var. stenophyton, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cold epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces pendant, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
