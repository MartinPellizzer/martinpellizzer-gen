    "intro": "Eschweilera confertiflora, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense canopy, smooth gray bark, and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing the edible Brazil nuts. It plays a crucial ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant is also economically significant due to its valuable seed crop."
