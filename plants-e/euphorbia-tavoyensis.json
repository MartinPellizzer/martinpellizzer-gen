    "intro": "Euphorbia tavoyensis, commonly known as the Tavoy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, and is characterized by its fleshy, often spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thickened stems. Euphorbia tavoyensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
