    "intro": "Eriocaulon melaleucum, commonly known as the white spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or waterlogged soils, often in swampy or marshy habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small white flowers, which are surrounded by a dense layer of soft, white hairs. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
