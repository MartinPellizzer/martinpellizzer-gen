    "intro": "Epidendrum mesomicron, commonly known as the miniature epidendrum, is a compact orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered pseudobulbs and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and manageable size, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
