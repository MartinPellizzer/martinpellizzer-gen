    "intro": "Euphorbia perennans, commonly known as the everlasting euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that often branches into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its stems allows it to survive in arid environments."
