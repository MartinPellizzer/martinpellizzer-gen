    "intro": "Eperua rubiginosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered eperua, is a tropical tree native to the lowland rainforests of northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, cream to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, often attracting a variety of pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental potential and is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
