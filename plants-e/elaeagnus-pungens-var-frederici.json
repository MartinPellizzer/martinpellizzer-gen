    "intro": "Elaeagnus pungens var. frederici, commonly known as silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and fragrant, yellowish-green foliage that turns reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, reddish berries that attract birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
