    "intro": "Euphorbia aucheri, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dark green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
