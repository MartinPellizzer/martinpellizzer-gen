    "intro": "Euphorbia literata, commonly known as the \"narrowleaf spurge,\" is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, somewhat hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is drought-tolerant and can survive in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Euphorbia literata is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
