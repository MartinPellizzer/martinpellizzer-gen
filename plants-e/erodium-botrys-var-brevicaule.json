It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and dry wastelands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in suitable habitats."
