    "intro": "Euphorbia inundaticola, commonly known as the floodplain spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid or seasonally flooded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist habitats where it can tolerate periodic flooding. Due to its ability to survive in challenging conditions, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
