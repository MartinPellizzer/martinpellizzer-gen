    "intro": "Epimedium sempervirens var. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered barberry, is a deciduous perennial shrub native to China. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and hardiness, suitable for USDA hardiness zones 4 through 8."
