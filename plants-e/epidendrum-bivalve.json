    "intro": "Epidendrum bivalve, commonly known as the two-valve orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
