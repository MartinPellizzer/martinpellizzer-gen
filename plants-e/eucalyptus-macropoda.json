    "intro": "Eucalyptus macropoda, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin strips, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. Eucalyptus macropoda is adapted to arid environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
