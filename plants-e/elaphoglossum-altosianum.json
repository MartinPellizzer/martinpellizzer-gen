    "intro": "Elaphoglossum altosianum, commonly known as the highland holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish coating, which helps in water retention. Elaphoglossum altosianum is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
