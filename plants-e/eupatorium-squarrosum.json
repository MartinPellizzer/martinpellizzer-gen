    "intro": "Eupatorium squarrosum, commonly known as rough skeletonweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white to pinkish flowers. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced when the plant is dried. Eupatorium squarrosum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly as a food source for certain insects."
