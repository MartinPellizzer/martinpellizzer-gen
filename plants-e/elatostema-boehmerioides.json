    "intro": "Elatostema boehmerioides, commonly known as the Boehmer's elatostema, is a small herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Elatostema boehmerioides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
