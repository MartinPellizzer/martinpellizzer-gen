    "intro": "Elaeocarpus lingualis, commonly known as the Tonga nut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tonga and Samoa. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that enclose a single, hard-shelled seed. The seeds are valued for their high oil content and are used in traditional crafts and as a source of food in some Pacific cultures."
