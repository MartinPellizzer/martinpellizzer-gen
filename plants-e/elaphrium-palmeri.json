    "intro": "Elaphrium palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's elaphrium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are finely divided, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Elaphrium palmeri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
