    "intro": "Erigeron pulchellus var. unalaschkensis, commonly known as the Alaska blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, tundra-like environments, often in open areas with well-drained soil. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-gray leaves and produces small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and short growing seasons."
