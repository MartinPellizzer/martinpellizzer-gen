    "intro": "Eugenia xanthophylla, commonly known as the golden eucalypt, is a species native to Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests. The golden eucalypt is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
