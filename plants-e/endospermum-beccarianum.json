    "intro": "Endospermum beccarianum, commonly known as the broad-leafed ghost gum, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to northern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and alternate, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Its endosperm is a key feature in the development of its seeds, providing nourishment during the early stages of germination. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
