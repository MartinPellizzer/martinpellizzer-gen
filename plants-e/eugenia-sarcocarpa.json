    "intro": "Eugenia sarcocarpa, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor. Eugenia sarcocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight."
