It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is drought-tolerant and prefers warm, dry climates, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a desirable addition to arid landscapes."
