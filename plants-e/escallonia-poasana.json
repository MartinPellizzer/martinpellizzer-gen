    "intro": "Escallonia poasana, commonly known as the Chilean firebush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Escallonia poasana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and temperate regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in mild climates."
