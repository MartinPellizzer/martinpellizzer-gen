    "intro": "Euphorbia thinophila, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem with small, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. Euphorbia thinophila is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
