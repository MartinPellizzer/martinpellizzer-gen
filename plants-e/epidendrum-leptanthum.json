    "intro": "Epidendrum leptanthum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow pseudobulbs and linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum leptanthum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
