    "intro": "Eriachne dominii, commonly known as the dwarf grass or narrowleaf eriachne, is a grass species native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
