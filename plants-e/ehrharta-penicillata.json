    "intro": "Ehrharta penicillata, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance. Its seed heads are distinctive, resembling a cluster of tiny fingers, which gives it its common name."
