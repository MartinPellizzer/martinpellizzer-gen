    "intro": "Eleocharis squamigera, commonly known as the flat-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomes contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Eleocharis squamigera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of fluctuating water levels and ability to improve soil quality."
