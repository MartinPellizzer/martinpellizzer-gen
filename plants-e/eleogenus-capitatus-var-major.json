    "intro": "Eleogenus capitatus var. major, commonly known as the giant sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, spiny seed heads that form dense clusters, which are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy and dry soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss in harsh environments. The species is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
