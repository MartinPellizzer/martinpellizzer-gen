It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
