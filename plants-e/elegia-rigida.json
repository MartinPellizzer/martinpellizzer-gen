    "intro": "Elegia rigida, commonly known as rigid elegia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or wetland restoration projects."
