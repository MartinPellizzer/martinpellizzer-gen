    "intro": "Ervum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and pinnately compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Ervum longifolium plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
