It is a climbing or trailing cactus that produces large, showy flowers at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees or rocks in its native habitat. Its stems are segmented and covered in soft, spiny areoles. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, opening in the evening and closing by dawn."
