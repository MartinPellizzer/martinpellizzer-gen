    "intro": "Elytrigia alatavica, commonly known as the Transcaucasian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Elytrigia alatavica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
