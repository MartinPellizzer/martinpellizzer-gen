    "intro": "Erica serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or pale red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica serpyllifolia is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and coastal areas, due to its drought-resistant properties. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
