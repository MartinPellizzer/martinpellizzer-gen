It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its striking appearance and relative ease of care, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and rockeries."
