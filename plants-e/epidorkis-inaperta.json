    "intro": "Epidorkis inaperta, commonly known as the smooth-skin fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a smooth, non-glandular surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Epidorkis inaperta plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
