It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that have a velvety texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, and they bloom from late spring to early summer.
