    "intro": "Erigeron retroflexus, commonly known as the hairy blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The showy blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
