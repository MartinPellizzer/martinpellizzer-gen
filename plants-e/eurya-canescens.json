    "intro": "Eurya canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Eurya canescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
