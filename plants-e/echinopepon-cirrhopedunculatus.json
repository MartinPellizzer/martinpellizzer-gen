    "intro": "Echinopepon cirrhopedunculatus, commonly known as the curled-stem melon, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted fruit that resembles a spiral or curl. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often with a rough texture. The fruit, while not commonly cultivated, is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and potential ecological significance."
