    "intro": "Ephedra gibraltarica, commonly known as the Gibraltar ephedra, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. It features distinctive, elongated stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
