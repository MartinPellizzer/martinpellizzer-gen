    "intro": "Elaphoglossum engleri, commonly known as the Engler's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions such as Indonesia and the Philippines. Elaphoglossum engleri thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
