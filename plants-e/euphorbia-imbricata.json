    "intro": "Euphorbia imbricata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with smooth, greenish-gray stems that are covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, oval, and slightly hairy, and they often fall off when the plant is mature. Euphorbia imbricata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
