    "intro": "Echinocactus stellatus, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a spineless cactus with a globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens."
