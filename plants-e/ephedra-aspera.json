    "intro": "Ephedra aspera, commonly known as Chinese ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Ephedra aspera contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. However, its use is now regulated due to potential toxicity and legal restrictions."
