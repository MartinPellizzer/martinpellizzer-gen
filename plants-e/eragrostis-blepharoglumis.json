It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a fibrous root system and produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Eragrostis blepharoglumis is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and drought tolerance."
