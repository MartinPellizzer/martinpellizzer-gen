    "intro": "Eleutherococcus hypoleucus, commonly known as Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its adaptability and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
