    "intro": "Eleocharis difformis, commonly known as the variable spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces dark, elongated berries that disperse via water or animals. Eleocharis difformis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
