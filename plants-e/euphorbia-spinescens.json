    "intro": "Euphorbia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are typically borne on short, branched inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help deter herbivores and reduce water loss. Euphorbia spinescens is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and resilience in dry environments."
