    "intro": "Equisetum \u00d7 litorale f. formosum, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid fern-like plant that thrives in wet, saline environments. It features a distinctive, jointed stem with whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its ability to tolerate high levels of salt and moisture, making it common in coastal regions. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing cones, typical of the Equisetum genus. This formosum form is particularly noted for its ornamental value and ecological adaptability in maritime climates."
