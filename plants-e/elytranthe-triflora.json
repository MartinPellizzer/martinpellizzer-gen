    "intro": "Elytranthe triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered elytranthe, is a small herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets, and its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
