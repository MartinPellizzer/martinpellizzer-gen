    "intro": "Eulophia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are segmented and store water, aiding survival in seasonal dry periods. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
