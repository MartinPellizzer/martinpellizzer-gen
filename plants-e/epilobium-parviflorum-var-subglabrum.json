    "intro": "Epilobium parviflorum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine hairs, though the variety subglabrum is distinguished by its smoother texture. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers arranged in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly waxy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
