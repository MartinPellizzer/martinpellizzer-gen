    "intro": "Englerastrum, commonly known as the \"southern star\" or \"star grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow to orange composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a star-like pattern. The plants are native to southern Africa and are often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Englerastrum species are generally herbaceous, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in their native environments."
