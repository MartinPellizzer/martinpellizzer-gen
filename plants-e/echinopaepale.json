    "intro": "Echinopaepale, commonly known as the spiny pale orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spiky floral structure. The plant produces small, pale-colored flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between late autumn and early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand the harsh, high-altitude climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echinopaepale is considered a conservation concern."
