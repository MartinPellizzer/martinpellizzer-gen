    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and its distinctive, spurred orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in shaded, moist woodland habitats. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a dark lip. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaf size and reduced flower structure compared to the typical E. helleborine."
