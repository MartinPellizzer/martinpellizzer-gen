    "intro": "Euphorbia pauciradiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem with small, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
