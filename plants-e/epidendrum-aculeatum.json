    "intro": "Epidendrum aculeatum, commonly known as the spiked epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Epidendrum aculeatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
