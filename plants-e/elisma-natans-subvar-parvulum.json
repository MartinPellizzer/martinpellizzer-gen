    "intro": "Elisma natans subvar. parvulum, commonly known as the small-flowered water-plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats on the water surface. Elisma natans subvar. parvulum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
