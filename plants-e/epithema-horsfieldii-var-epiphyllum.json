    "intro": "Epithema horsfieldii var. epiphyllum, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that often grow horizontally or pendulously, allowing it to thrive in tree canopies. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in arid conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
