    "intro": "Echinopsis hystrichoides, commonly known as the \"Lion's Head\" cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and large, spiny, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a dense covering of white bristles, which help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements. Echinopsis hystrichoides is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and surviving long periods of drought."
