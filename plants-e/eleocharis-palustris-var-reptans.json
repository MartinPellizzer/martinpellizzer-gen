    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. reptans, commonly known as the wandering sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects to rehabilitate degraded wetland areas."
