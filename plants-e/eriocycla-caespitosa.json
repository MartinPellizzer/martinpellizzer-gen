    "intro": "Eriocycla caespitosa, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and hairy, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures similar to dandelions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Eriocycla caespitosa is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, making it a common component of desert and chaparral ecosystems."
