    "intro": "Excoecaria cuspidata, commonly known as the Ceylon croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that can vary in shape from ovate to lanceolate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
