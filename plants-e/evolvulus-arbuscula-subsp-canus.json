    "intro": "Evolvulus arbuscula subsp. canus, commonly known as the white-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a pale green or nearly white coloration, giving the plant its common name.
