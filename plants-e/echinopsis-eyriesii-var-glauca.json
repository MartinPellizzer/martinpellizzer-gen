    "intro": "Echinopsis eyriesii var. glauca, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a bluish or grayish waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
