    "intro": "Eriogonum restioides, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Eriogonum restioides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
