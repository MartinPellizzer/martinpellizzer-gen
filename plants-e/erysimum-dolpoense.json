    "intro": "Erysimum dolpoense, commonly known as the Dolpo mustard, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and Tibet. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving at high altitudes. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
