    "intro": "Eranthis byunsanensis f. pungdoensis, commonly known as the Pungdo mountain corydalis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features basal leaves with long, narrow blades and produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
