    "intro": "Epidendrum spruceanum, commonly known as the Spruce's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
