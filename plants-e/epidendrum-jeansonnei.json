    "intro": "Epidendrum jeansonnei, commonly known as the Jeansonne's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of pink, white, and violet, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Epidendrum jeansonnei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
