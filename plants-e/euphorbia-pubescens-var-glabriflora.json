    "intro": "Euphorbia pubescens var. glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with short, fleshy stems covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, soft pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
