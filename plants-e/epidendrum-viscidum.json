    "intro": "Epidendrum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy inflorescences and vibrant, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange-red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and utilizing atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Epidendrum viscidum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
