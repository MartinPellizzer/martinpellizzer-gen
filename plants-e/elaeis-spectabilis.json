    "intro": "Elaeis spectabilis, commonly known as the ornamental oil palm, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and tall, straight trunk, which can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that grow in clusters, followed by fruit that resembles a coconut in appearance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for commercial oil production. Its growth habit makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
