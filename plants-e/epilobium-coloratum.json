    "intro": "Epilobium coloratum, commonly known as the purple willow-herb, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and the stems are usually reddish in color. Epilobium coloratum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
