    "intro": "Exallage perhispida, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged foliage. Its succulent leaves help it conserve water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Exallage perhispida is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
