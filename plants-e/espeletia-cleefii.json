    "intro": "Espeletia cleefii, commonly known as the Cleef's espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Espeletia cleefii is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems."
