    "intro": "Eugenia smithii var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved velvetwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round, reddish-brown fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in subtropical and tropical climates."
