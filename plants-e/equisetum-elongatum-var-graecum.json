    "intro": "Equisetum elongatum var. graecum, commonly known as the Greek horse-tail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a central, unbranched stem. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period. The species is notable for its primitive morphology and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
