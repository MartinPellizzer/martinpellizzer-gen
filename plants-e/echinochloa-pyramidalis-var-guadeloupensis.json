    "intro": "Echinochloa pyramidalis var. guadeloupensis, commonly known as the Guadeloupe panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicle-like inflorescence composed of spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding."
