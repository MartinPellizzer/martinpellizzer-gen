    "intro": "Euphrasia nemorosa subsp. tatarica, commonly known as the Tatarische eyebright, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, often clustered in loose racemes. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its medicinal historical use. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical E. nemorosa."
