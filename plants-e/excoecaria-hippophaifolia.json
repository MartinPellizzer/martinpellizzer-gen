    "intro": "Excoecaria hippophaifolia, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain a sweet, edible pulp. Its latex sap is toxic and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural rubber source. The plant's resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
