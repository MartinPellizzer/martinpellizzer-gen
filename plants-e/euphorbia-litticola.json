    "intro": "Euphorbia litticola, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal landscaping."
