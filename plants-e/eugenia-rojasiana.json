    "intro": "Eugenia rojasiana, commonly known as the R\u00edo Negro myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, small, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, aromatic berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
