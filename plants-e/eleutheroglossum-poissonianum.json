    "intro": "Eleutheroglossum poissonianum, commonly known as the Poisson's eleutheroglossum, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes specialized labellum and column features. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small, delicate flowers are usually white or pale green, and it is known for its limited geographic distribution and low population numbers. Due to habitat destruction and limited study, it remains a poorly understood species within the orchid family."
