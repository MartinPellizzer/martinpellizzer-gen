    "intro": "Euonymus striatus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Its woody stems are often covered in a flaky, exfoliating bark, and it is commonly found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade."
