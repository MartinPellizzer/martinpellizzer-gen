    "intro": "Elsota virgata, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help stabilize the soil. Elsota virgata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
