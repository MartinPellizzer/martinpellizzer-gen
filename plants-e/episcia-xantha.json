    "intro": "Episcia xantha, commonly known as the golden wax plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting markings. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Episcia xantha is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
