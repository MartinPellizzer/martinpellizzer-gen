    "intro": "Echinocactus cupreatus, commonly known as the copper barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the top of the stem. Its spines are typically reddish-brown and provide protection against herbivores. Echinocactus cupreatus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
