    "intro": "Elisma natans f. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats. It features slender, horizontal stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the surface of water or moist soil. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often floating on the water's surface or just above it. This variety is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, contributing to the ecological stability of wetlands."
