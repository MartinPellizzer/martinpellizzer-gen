    "intro": "Electranthera mutica var. multiligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green color, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring warm climates. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
