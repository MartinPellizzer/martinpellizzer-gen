    "intro": "Erysimum robustum, commonly known as the robust wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with four petals, often arranged in racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Erysimum robustum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
