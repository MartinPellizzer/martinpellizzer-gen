    "intro": "Equisetum huegelii, commonly known as the Hugel's horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in wet or moist environments. Equisetum huegelii is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its ancient appearance and primitive structure make it a valuable subject for botanical study."
