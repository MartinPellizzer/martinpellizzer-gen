    "intro": "Eschweilera neomontana, commonly known as the Neomontana zygocactus, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer. The plant has a woody stem and produces large, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
