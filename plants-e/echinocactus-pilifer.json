    "intro": "Echinocactus pilifer, commonly known as the feathered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in thick, ribbed spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Echinocactus pilifer is a slow-growing cactus that is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
