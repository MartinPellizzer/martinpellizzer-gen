    "intro": "Eriophyllum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to California and parts of Oregon. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Eriophyllum lanceolatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
