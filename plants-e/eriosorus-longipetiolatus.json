    "intro": "Eriosorus longipetiolatus, commonly known as the long-petioled fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural collections."
