    "intro": "Epidendrum hajekii, commonly known as the Mexican Flame Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting yellow and green markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, leathery layer that helps store water. Epidendrum hajekii thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining soil."
