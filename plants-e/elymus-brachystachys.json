    "intro": "Elymus brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Elymus brachystachys is valued for its ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and as a food source for grazing animals."
