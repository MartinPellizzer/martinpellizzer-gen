    "intro": "Eumorpha marmorata, commonly known as the marble butterfly, is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in the Neotropical region. It is characterized by its strikingly patterned wings, which display a mix of black, white, and orange hues, resembling marble. The plant's botanical aspects are not directly relevant, as Eumorpha marmorata is an animal, not a plant. However, it relies on specific host plants such as passion vines for its larval development. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of these plants, making them essential for its survival."
