    "intro": "Ehretia anacua, commonly known as the white mahoe, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and along riverbanks. The leaves and bark have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
