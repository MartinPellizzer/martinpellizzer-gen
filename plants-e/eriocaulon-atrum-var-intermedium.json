    "intro": "Eriocaulon atrum var. intermedium, commonly known as the black spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in its habitat. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
