    "intro": "Euphorbia helicothele, commonly known as the spiral euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, and it has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
