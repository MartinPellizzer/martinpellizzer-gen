    "intro": "Erigeron deustus, commonly known as the white fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its pale blue to white ray florets and yellow disk florets, which give it a daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Erigeron deustus is often found in the central and eastern United States, where it thrives in full sun."
