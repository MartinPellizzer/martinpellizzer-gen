    "intro": "Epidendrum aeridiforme, commonly known as the aerial epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive, elongated shape. The leaves are usually long and narrow, and the plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure and growth pattern make it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
