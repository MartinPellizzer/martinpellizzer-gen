    "intro": "Evolvulus alsinoides var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a weed and a plant of interest in ecological studies."
