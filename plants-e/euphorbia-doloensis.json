    "intro": "Euphorbia doloensis, commonly known as the Dolo Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the dry regions of West Africa. It belongs to the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically reduced or absent, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic organ. Euphorbia doloensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
