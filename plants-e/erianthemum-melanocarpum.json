    "intro": "Erianthemum melanocarpum, commonly known as black-fruited erianthemum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its fruit is a dark, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
