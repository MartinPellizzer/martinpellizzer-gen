It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
