It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a common component of spinifex grasslands."
