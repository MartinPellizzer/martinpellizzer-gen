It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble a globe, which are a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by the distinctive, woody, spiky fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Echinops turczaninowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
