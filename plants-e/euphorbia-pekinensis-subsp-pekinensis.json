It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised as it contains toxic compounds."
