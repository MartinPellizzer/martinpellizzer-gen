    "intro": "Erythrina latiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which consist of three to five broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces striking red or orange-red flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant floral display and the presence of long, slender seed pods. Erythrina latiflora is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
