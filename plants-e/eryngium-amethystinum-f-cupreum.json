It features striking, spiky, purple-blue flower heads that are surrounded by silver-gray bracts, giving it a metallic appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it prefers well-drained soil in full sun.
