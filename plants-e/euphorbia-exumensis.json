    "intro": "Euphorbia exumensis, commonly known as the Exum's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Euphorbia exumensis is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
