    "intro": "Epidendrum corymbosum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
