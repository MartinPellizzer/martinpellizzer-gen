    "intro": "Epidendrum croceum, commonly known as the Yellow Epidendrum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. The flowers are notable for their bright color and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their visual appeal."
