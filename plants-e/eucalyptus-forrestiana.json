    "intro": "Eucalyptus forrestiana, commonly known as the Forster's eucalypt, is a tall, slender tree native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a vibrant red or orange inner layer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well-adapted to humid, subtropical climates and plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
