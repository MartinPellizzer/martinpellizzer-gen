    "intro": "Eurya osimensis, commonly known as the Yunnan eurya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense foliage and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Eurya osimensis is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
