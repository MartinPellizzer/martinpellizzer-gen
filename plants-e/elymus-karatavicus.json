    "intro": "Elymus karatavicus, commonly known as the Karatavsky grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually pale green to golden in color. It thrives in dry, semi-arid environments and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Elymus karatavicus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
