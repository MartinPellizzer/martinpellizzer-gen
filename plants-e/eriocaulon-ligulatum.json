    "intro": "Eriocaulon ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spike-like clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stalks. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in wetland habitats. Eriocaulon ligulatum thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and ponds."
