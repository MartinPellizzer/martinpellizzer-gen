    "intro": "Echinonyctanthus multiplex, commonly known as the flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
