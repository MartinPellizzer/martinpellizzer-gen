It is a climbing vine that produces large, smooth-skinned fruits with a cylindrical shape. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and bears yellow flowers that develop into the characteristic gourd fruits. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. The variety is distinguished by its lack of spines on the fruit surface, setting it apart from other echinocystis species."
