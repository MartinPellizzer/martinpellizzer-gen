    "intro": "Erica minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant is well adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact size and ornamental value. Erica minutifolia is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
