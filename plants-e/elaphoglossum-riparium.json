    "intro": "Elaphoglossum riparium, commonly known as the river fern, is a small, delicate fern native to wet tropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and riverbanks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Elaphoglossum riparium plays a role in stabilizing soil along waterways and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
