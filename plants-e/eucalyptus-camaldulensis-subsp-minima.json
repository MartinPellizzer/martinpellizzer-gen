    "intro": "Eucalyptus camaldulensis subsp. minima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in thin strips, revealing a pale, fibrous underbark. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, followed by woody capsules containing minute seeds. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and coastal areas."
