    "intro": "Equisetum hyemale var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax variety of horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are typically green to brown in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
