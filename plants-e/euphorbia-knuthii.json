    "intro": "Euphorbia knuthii, commonly known as Knuth's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to harsh desert conditions. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
