    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris var. vulgaris, commonly known as common spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense tussocks with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in marshes, pond margins, and other wet habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
