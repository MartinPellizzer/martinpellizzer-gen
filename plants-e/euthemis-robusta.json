    "intro": "Euthemis robusta, commonly known as the robust euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Due to its succulent nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
