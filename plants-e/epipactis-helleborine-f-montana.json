    "intro": "Epipactis helleborine f. montana, commonly known as the alpine helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other Epipactis species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
