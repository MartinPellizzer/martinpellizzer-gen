    "intro": "Euphorbia rugosa, commonly known as the rough spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in small, green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. Euphorbia rugosa is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
