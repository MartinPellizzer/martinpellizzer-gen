    "intro": "Elaeagnus hortensis, commonly known as the silver berry or sandthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its capacity to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant for soil improvement. It produces fragrant, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the edible berries. Elaeagnus hortensis is often used in ornamental gardening and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
