    "intro": "Eria cladophylax, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with dense, dark green foliage. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Eria cladophylax thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
