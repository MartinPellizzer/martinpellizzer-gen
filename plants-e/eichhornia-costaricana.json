    "intro": "Eichhornia costaricana, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface. The plant produces striking purple flowers that bloom on long, spiral stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in non-native regions."
