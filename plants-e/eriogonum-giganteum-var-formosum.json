It is characterized by its large, showy white to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a robust root system and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
