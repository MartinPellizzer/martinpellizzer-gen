    "intro": "Eucalyptus arenicola, commonly known as the sandplain gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Eucalyptus arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
