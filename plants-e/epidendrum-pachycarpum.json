    "intro": "Epidendrum pachycarpum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and using them for support rather than as a source of nutrients. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid and often rainy environment. Epidendrum pachycarpum is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
