    "intro": "Euphorbia cinerascens, commonly known as the gray spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a grayish, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem for survival in arid conditions. Euphorbia cinerascens is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal areas."
