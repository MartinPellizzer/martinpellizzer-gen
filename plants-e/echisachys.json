    "intro": "Echisachys, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to various regions of Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy seed heads similar to those of dandelions. Echisachys species are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
