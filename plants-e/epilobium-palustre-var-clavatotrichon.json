    "intro": "Epilobium palustre var. clavatotrichon, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive hairy appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a reddish or purple tinge, and are arranged oppositely along the stem. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds."
