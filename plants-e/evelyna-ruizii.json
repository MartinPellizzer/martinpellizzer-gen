    "intro": "Evelyna ruizii, commonly known as the Ruiz's velvet fern, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Evelyna ruizii is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
