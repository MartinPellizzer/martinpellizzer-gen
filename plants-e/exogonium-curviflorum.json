    "intro": "Exogonium curviflorum, commonly known as the curlflower, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It belongs to the family Araceae, which is known for its modified leaves called cataphylls. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of small flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers arranged in different zones on the spadix. This botanical feature contributes to its role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
