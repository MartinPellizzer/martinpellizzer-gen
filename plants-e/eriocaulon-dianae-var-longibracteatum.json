    "intro": "Eriocaulon dianae var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract eriocaulon, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. This variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower clusters, giving it its specific epithet."
