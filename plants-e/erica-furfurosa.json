    "intro": "Erica furfurosa, commonly known as the golden heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is native to the western Cape region of South Africa, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Erica furfurosa has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, with periods of drought and seasonal rainfall."
