    "intro": "Eucalyptus transcontinentalis, commonly known as the Transcontinental gum, is a tall, slender tree native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and white beneath. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in clusters during the cooler months. This hardy species is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
