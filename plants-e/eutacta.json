    "intro": "Eutacta, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, swollen stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate and lance-shaped, while the flowers are small and clustered in complex inflorescences. Eutacta species are native to regions of Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
