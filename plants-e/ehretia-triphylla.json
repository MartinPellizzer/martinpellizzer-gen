    "intro": "Ehretia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in whorls of three, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, fleshy, orange-red berries. Its bark is thick and corky, often peeling in thin layers, and it has a moderate growth rate. Ehretia triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
