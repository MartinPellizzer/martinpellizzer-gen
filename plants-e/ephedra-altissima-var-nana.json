    "intro": "Ephedra altissima var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf ephedra, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically inconspicuous and clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are woody and contain alkaloids, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and arid garden settings."
