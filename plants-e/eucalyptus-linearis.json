    "intro": "Eucalyptus linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant typically grows in shrubland and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus linearis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions."
