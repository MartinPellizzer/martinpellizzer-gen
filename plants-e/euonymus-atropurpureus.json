    "intro": "Euonymus atropurpureus, commonly known as the red-awned euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn a striking red or purple in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red, inflated seed capsules that persist into winter. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and distinctive foliage. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
