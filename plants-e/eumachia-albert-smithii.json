It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, coastal environments where it grows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
