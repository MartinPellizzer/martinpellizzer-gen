    "intro": "Epidendrum esculentum, commonly known as the edible orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces fleshy, edible pseudobulbs that are rich in starch and have been used as a food source by indigenous peoples. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The botanical features of Epidendrum esculentum make it both an ornamental and a historically significant plant in native cultures."
