    "intro": "Eremophila obovata var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous emu bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs, though the variety glabriuscula is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
