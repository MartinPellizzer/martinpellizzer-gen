    "intro": "Echinocactus tulensis, commonly known as the Tulip Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Echinocactus tulensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
