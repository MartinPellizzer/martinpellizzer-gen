    "intro": "Elaphoglossum lonchophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, narrow base that resembles a tongue. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
