    "intro": "Eremostachys cabulica, commonly known as Afghan sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its hairy leaves help reduce water loss, and it has a deep root system to access moisture. Eremostachys cabulica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
