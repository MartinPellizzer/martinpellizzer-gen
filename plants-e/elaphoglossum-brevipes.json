    "intro": "Elaphoglossum brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Elaphoglossum brevipes is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
