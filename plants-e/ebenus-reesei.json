    "intro": "Ebenus reesei, commonly known as the desert sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with small, clustered leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Ebenus reesei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
