    "intro": "Eriosema populifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf eriosema, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble those of a poplar tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its hairy stems and leaves are typical features of the Eriosema genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats."
