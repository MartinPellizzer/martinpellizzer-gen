    "intro": "Euphorbia macdonaldii, commonly known as the MacDonald's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its water-storing leaves and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Euphorbia macdonaldii is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun conditions."
