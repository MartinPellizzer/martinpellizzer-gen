    "intro": "Echinocactus tephracanthus, commonly known as the Mexican fire cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems. The plant's unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
