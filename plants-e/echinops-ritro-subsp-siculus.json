    "intro": "Echinops ritro subsp. siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical crown of bracts that resemble a thistle, which is a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice in xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens."
