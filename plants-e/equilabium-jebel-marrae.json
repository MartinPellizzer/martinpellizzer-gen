    "intro": "Equilabium jebel-marrae, commonly known as the Jebel Marrae equilabium, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces capsules as fruits, which contain numerous small seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
