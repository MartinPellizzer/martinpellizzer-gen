It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of Nevada and surrounding regions."
