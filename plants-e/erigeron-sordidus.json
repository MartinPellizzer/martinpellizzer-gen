    "intro": "Erigeron sordidus, commonly known as the dirty fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually pale greenish-white, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Erigeron sordidus is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
