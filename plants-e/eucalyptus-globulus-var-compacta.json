    "intro": "Eucalyptus globulus var. compacta, commonly known as the Tasmanian peppermint, is a compact, aromatic shrub or small tree native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular and emit a strong menthol scent. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in moist, cool climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and essential oil production. This variety is distinct from the more widely known Eucalyptus globulus due to its smaller size and unique foliage."
