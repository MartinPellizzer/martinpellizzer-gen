It is a shrub characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Native to regions with acidic soils, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained environments such as heathlands and woodlands. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it often forms dense colonies. The plant plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
