It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its flowering spikes are slender and produce small, spikelet-like flowers. Eragrostis multipilosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
