    "intro": "Ebenus lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf evening-primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in dispersal by wind or animals. Ebenus lanceolata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
