    "intro": "Eupatorium stoechadifolium var. typicum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers that appear in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a valuable plant for pollinators, attracting bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
