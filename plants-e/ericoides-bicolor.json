    "intro": "Ericoides bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically dense and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its often rocky, acidic soil habitat. Ericoides bicolor is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in coastal areas and high elevations."
