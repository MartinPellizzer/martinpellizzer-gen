    "intro": "Elaphoglossum crenatum, commonly known as the serrated harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often recurved and have a serrated margin. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
