    "intro": "Epidendrum hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water, enabling it to thrive in drier conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Epidendrum hatschbachii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
