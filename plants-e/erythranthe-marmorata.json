    "intro": "Erythranthe marmorata, commonly known as the marbled rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. Its leaves are basal and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are bright yellow and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
