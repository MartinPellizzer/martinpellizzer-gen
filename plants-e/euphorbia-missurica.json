    "intro": "Euphorbia missurica, commonly known as the Missouri spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant features a stout, branching stem covered with a waxy coating, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. The flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
