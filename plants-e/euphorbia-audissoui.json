    "intro": "Euphorbia audissoui, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
