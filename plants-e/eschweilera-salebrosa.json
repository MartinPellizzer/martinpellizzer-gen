    "intro": "Eschweilera salebrosa, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the dense rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, aromatic timber, though it is also critically endangered due to deforestation. The plant plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
