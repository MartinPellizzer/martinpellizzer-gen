    "intro": "Euphrasia salisburgensis proles ceretanica, commonly known as the Salzburg's beard-tongue, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing shades of pink and purple. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
