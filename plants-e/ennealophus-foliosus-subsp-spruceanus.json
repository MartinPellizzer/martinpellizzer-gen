    "intro": "Ennealophus foliosus subsp. spruceanus, commonly known as the Spruceleaf Ennealophus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted for pollination by wind or specific insect species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows or on steep slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
