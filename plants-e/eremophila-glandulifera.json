    "intro": "Eremophila glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of native flora. Eremophila glandulifera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
