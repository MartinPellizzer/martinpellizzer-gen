    "intro": "Eupatorium scabrellum, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soils. The plant features rough, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale blue, appearing in late summer to early autumn. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
