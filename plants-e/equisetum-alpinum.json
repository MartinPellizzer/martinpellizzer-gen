    "intro": "Equisetum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine horse tail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of sterile and fertile branches, with the latter producing spore-bearing cones. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine and subalpine regions. It lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures called megaphylls. Equisetum alpinum is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
