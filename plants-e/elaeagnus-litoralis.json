It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves and small, edible berries that ripen in the autumn. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It has a rapid growth rate and is often used for dune stabilization due to its extensive root system. Elaeagnus litoralis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
