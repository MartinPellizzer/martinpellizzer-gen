    "intro": "Epilobium aconcaguinum, commonly known as the Aconcagua willow, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, often in areas with moderate to high rainfall. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to coastal conditions and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Epilobium aconcaguinum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
