    "intro": "Echinocereus phoeniceus var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinct, spiny appearance, featuring thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its spines are long and often have a reddish or brownish hue, providing both protection and a striking visual characteristic."
