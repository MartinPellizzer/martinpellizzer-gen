It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers.

It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
