    "intro": "Euphorbia triflora subsp. kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, characteristic of the Euphorbia genus, contains toxic compounds that can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
