    "intro": "Espeletia sclerophylla, commonly known as the Santa Marta pineapple plant, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous yellow flowers, which bloom in the dry season. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Espeletia sclerophylla is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its ecological importance in cloud forest ecosystems."
