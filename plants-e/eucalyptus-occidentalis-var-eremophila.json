    "intro": "Eucalyptus occidentalis var. eremophila, commonly known as the red bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
