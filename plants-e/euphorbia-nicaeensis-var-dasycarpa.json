    "intro": "Euphorbia nicaeensis var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to dry and rocky environments, making it a resilient species. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in arid climates."
