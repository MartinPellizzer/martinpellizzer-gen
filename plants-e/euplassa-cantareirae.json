    "intro": "Euplassa cantareirae, commonly known as the Cantareira fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss, Euplassa cantareirae is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations."
