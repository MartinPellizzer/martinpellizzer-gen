    "intro": "Euonymus myrianthus var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic to lanceolate leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist woodland habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
