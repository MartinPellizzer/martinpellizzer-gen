    "intro": "Echinopsis densispina f. sublimiflora, commonly known as the Snowy Echinopsis, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its foliage is adapted to conserve water, with thick, fleshy stems that store moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
