    "intro": "Euphorbia mesopotamica, commonly known as the Mesopotamian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It features a branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cyathium, a specialized inflorescence common in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions."
