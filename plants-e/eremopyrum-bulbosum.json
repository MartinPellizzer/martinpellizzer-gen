    "intro": "Eremopyrum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous wildrye, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and the presence of bulbous basal stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Eremopyrum bulbosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
