    "intro": "Epipactis bicarinata, commonly known as the two-lobed helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is divided into two lobes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Epipactis bicarinata is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
