    "intro": "Euphorbia pseudoaprica, commonly known as the false apricot spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for drought resistance. Euphorbia pseudoaprica is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
