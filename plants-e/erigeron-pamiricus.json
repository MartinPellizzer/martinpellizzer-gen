    "intro": "Erigeron pamiricus, commonly known as the Pamir fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its small, hairy leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erigeron pamiricus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
