    "intro": "Eucalyptus sublucida, commonly known as the white mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin flakes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-white underside, which contributes to its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, typically during the winter months. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands."
