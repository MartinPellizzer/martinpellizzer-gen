    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla var. cyathophora, commonly known as the velvetleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety foliage that ranges from green to reddish-purple in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas."
