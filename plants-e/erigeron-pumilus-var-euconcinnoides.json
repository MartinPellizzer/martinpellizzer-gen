    "intro": "Erigeron pumilus var. euconcinnoides, commonly known as the dwarf fleabane, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow central disk, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its small size and distinctive appearance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
