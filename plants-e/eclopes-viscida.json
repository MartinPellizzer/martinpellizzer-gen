    "intro": "Eclopes viscida, commonly known as the stickyleaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries containing toxic seeds. Its fibrous stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The sticky resin has also been utilized by indigenous communities for various practical purposes."
