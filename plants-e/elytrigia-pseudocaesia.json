    "intro": "Elytrigia pseudocaesia, commonly known as the false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in soils with moderate to low fertility. Elytrigia pseudocaesia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
