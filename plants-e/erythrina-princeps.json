    "intro": "Erythrina princeps, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, flame-like flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three elliptic to ovate leaflets, and its pods are elongated, woody, and contain several seeds. Erythrina princeps is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a popular choice for reforestation and urban landscaping."
