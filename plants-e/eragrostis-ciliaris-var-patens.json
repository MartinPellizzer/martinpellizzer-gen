    "intro": "Eragrostis ciliaris var. patens, commonly known as the spreading beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous, with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability and ornamental potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
