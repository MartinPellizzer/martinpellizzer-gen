    "intro": "Eragrostis pilosa var. nana, commonly known as dwarf silky grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Africa and Asia. It features fine, hairy leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and erosion control."
