    "intro": "Erica filiformis var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
