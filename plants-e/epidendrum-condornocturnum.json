    "intro": "Epidendrum condornocturnum, commonly known as the night-blooming epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night and close in the morning. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often with a waxy texture to retain moisture. The flowers are usually violet or purple, with a complex structure that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths."
