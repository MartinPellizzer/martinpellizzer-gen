    "intro": "Equisetum palustre f. wachteri, commonly known as the Wachter's marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often found in marshes and along waterways. The plant features whorled, needle-like leaves and produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. This fern-like plant is part of the Equisetaceae family and is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
