    "intro": "Euphoria verruculosa, commonly known as the warty euphorbia, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
