    "intro": "Ephemerantha kunstleri, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and ephemeral plant species native to the arid regions of Namibia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear only briefly during the rainy season. The plant's unique morphology includes a low-growing rosette structure with narrow, waxy leaves that help conserve moisture. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and pink, are short-lived, often lasting only a few hours. Due to its extreme rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ephemerantha kunstleri is considered a vulnerable species."
