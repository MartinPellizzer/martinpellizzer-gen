    "intro": "Elaeocarpus aristatus, commonly known as the silky fruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody fruits with a silky coating. These fruits contain a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic aril. Elaeocarpus aristatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
