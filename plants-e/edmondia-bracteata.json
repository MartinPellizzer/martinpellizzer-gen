    "intro": "Edmondia bracteata, commonly known as the bract-edged sandverbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which give the plant its common name. Edmondia bracteata thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
