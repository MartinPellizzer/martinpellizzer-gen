    "intro": "Elaphoglossum hammelianum, commonly known as the Hammel's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum hammelianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
