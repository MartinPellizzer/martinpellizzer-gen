It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Erysimum dregeanum is adapted to withstand high temperatures and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
