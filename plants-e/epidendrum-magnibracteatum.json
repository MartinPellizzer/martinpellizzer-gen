    "intro": "Epidendrum magnibracteatum, commonly known as the giant bract epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence and vibrant, colorful flowers that can range from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Epidendrum magnibracteatum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
