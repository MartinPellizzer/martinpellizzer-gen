    "intro": "Epidendrum stangeanum, commonly known as the Stange's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically has long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum stangeanum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
