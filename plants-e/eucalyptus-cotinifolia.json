    "intro": "Eucalyptus cotinifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrubs or small trees with smooth, peeling bark. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a bluish-green hue and a prominent midrib. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
