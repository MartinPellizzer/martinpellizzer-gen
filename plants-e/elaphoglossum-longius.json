    "intro": "Elaphoglossum longius, commonly known as the long-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum longius thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitats."
