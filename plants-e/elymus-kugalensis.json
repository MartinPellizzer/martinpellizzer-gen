    "intro": "Elymus kugalensis, commonly known as the Kugal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Elymus kugalensis thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
