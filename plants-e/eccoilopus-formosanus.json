    "intro": "Eccoilopus formosanus, commonly known as the Formosan mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude, shaded forest environments, often growing on rocky substrates or tree trunks. Its morphology includes long, slender leaves and a compact, upright growth habit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
