    "intro": "Eleocharis filiformis, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a species of grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for various aquatic organisms. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
