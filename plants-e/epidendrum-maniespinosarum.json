    "intro": "Epidendrum maniespinosarum, commonly known as the spiny epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
