    "intro": "Erigeron \u00d7 gypsophilus, commonly known as the Shasta daisy, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the western United States. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals surrounding a central cluster of yellow disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of gray-green, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. It is well-suited for garden use due to its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
