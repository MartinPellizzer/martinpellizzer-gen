    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla var. linifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
