    "intro": "Epiphyllanthus, commonly known as the \"leaf-living\" plant, is a unique species that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's foliage consists of broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Epiphyllanthus is often found in tropical rainforests and is considered a rare and delicate species."
