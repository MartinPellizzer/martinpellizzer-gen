It is native to the Korean Peninsula and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
