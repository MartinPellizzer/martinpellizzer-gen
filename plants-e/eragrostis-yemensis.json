    "intro": "Eragrostis yemensis, commonly known as Yemen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Yemen. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Eragrostis yemensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
