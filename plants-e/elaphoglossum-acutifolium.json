    "intro": "Elaphoglossum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium."
