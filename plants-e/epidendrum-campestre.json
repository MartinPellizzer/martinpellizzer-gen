    "intro": "Epidendrum campestre, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without parasitizing them, and it can thrive in a variety of substrates. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
