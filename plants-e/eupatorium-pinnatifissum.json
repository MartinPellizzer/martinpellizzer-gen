    "intro": "Eupatorium pinnatifissum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thoroughwort, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The leaves are pinnately divided, giving the plant its scientific name, and they are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
