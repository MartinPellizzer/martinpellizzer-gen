    "intro": "Erica linifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath or silver leaf heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray, giving it a distinctive appearance. Erica linifolia is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
