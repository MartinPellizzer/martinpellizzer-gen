    "intro": "Elettariopsis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy elettariopsis, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a small shrub characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white or pale pink petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
