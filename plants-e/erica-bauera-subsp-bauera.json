    "intro": "Erica bauera subsp. bauera, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Erica bauera subsp. bauera is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
