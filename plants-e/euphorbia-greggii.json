    "intro": "Euphorbia greggii, commonly known as the Gregg's mistletoe or desert mistletoe, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, waxy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Euphorbia greggii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
