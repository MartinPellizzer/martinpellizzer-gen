    "intro": "Elymus howellii, commonly known as Howell's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, and its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer. It is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils. The species is also a food source for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
