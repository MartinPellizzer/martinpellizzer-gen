    "intro": "Eucalyptus diversifolia, commonly known as the variable eucalypt, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often asymmetrical leaves that vary in shape and size along the branches. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules that contain the seeds. Eucalyptus diversifolia is well adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests or woodlands."
