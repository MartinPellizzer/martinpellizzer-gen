    "intro": "Erica ollula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a species of flowering plant native to the western regions of the United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica ollula thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
