    "intro": "Elymus ampliculmis, commonly known as the broad-leaved wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and wide, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Elymus ampliculmis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
