    "intro": "Eugenia aegiceroides, commonly known as the white mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and dark purple, edible fruits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and often used in traditional medicine. The fruit, while not as widely consumed as the red mangosteen, is valued for its unique flavor and potential health benefits."
