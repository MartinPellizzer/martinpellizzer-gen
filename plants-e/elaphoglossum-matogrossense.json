It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the leaves. Elaphoglossum matogrossense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
