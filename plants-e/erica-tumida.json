    "intro": "Erica tumida, commonly known as the purple heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, depending on the variety. Erica tumida is evergreen, with dense, leathery foliage that is often used in horticultural displays. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and requires minimal water once established."
