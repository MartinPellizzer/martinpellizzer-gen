    "intro": "Euphlebium sibuyanense, commonly known as the Sibuyan euphlebium, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Sibuyan in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with elongated, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and it is adapted to thrive in the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Euphlebium sibuyanense is considered a critically endangered species."
