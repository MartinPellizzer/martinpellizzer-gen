    "intro": "Elaphoglossum angustioblongum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its delicate appearance and intricate foliage make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
