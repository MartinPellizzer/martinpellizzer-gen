    "intro": "Epilobium albiflorum, commonly known as white-flowered willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as along stream banks and in meadows. The plant features erect stems that are often covered with glandular hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly toothed margin. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and are arranged in dense spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer. Epilobium albiflorum is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
