    "intro": "Euphorbia heterophylla var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine white hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
