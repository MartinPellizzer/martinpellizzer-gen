    "intro": "Epiphyllum hookeri subsp. pittieri, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that are often green or variegated with white or pink. The plant produces showy, vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the holiday season. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance and blooming habits make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and homes."
