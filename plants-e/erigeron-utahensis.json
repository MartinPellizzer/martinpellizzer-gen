It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows, thriving in arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Utah fleabane is often used in native plant gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
