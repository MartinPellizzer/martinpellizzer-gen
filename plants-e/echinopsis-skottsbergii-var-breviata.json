    "intro": "Echinopsis skottsbergii var. breviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, columnar stems and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
