It is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy, bluish-green leaves that form a dense, globular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
