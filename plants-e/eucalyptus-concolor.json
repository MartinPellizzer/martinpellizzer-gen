    "intro": "Eucalyptus concolor, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-blue hue, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, globular white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
