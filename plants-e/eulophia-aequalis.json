    "intro": "Eulophia aequalis, commonly known as the equal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering stems. Its flowers are usually arranged in a raceme and are characterized by their striking coloration, often in shades of white, yellow, or orange. Eulophia aequalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
