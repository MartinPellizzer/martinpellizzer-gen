    "intro": "Elaphoglossum chiapense, commonly known as the Chiapan fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are arranged in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Elaphoglossum chiapense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
