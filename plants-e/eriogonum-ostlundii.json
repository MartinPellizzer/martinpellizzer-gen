    "intro": "Eriogonum ostlundii, commonly known as the San Diego fairy duster, is a flowering plant native to southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. It is a member of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
