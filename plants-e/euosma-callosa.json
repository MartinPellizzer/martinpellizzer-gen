    "intro": "Euosma callosa, commonly known as the California boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Euosma callosa is well adapted to coastal climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
