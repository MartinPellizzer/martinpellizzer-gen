    "intro": "Elymus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned florets. Elymus hirsutus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its adaptability and resilience make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
