    "intro": "Euphorbia hirtula, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, which is a common feature among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it often thrives in dry, rocky soils. Euphorbia hirtula is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
