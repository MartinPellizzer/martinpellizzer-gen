    "intro": "Ervum varium, commonly known as the variable bean, is a lesser-known legume species characterized by its distinctive floral and foliar morphology. It typically grows in temperate regions and exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a robust root system that aids in nitrogen fixation. Due to its adaptability, Ervum varium is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant or for its potential medicinal properties."
