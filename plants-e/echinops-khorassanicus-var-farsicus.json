It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, giving it its genus name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
