    "intro": "Euphorbia arvalis, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a branched stem system with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested, making it a plant to handle with care."
