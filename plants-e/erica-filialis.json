    "intro": "Erica filialis, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Erica filialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
