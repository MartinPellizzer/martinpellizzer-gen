    "intro": "Eucalyptus formanii, commonly known as the Forman's mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. This plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy soils with good drainage."
