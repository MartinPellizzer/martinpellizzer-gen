    "intro": "Euclea kraussiana, commonly known as the wild pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal areas and riverine forests. Euclea kraussiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
