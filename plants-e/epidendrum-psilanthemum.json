    "intro": "Epidendrum psilanthemum, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Epidendrum psilanthemum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
