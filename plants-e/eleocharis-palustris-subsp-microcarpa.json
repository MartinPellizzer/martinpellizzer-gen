    "intro": "Eleocharis palustris subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas. Its tiny, pale brown to reddish-brown fruits are enclosed in a protective bract, which helps in seed dispersal. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
