    "intro": "Echinospermum lanceolatum, commonly known as the spiny sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. The plant produces small, hard-seeded fruits known as achenes, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
