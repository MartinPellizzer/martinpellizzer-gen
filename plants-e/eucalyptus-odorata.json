    "intro": "Eucalyptus odorata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale pink, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable for both ecological and commercial purposes. Eucalyptus odorata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils."
