    "intro": "Erica beatricis, commonly known as the royal heather, is a flowering plant native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, dense clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Erica beatricis is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
