    "intro": "Eriophorum brachyantherum var. pellucidum, commonly known as the glassy tussock sedge, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. This variant is distinguished by its translucent, waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it its common name."
