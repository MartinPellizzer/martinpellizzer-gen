    "intro": "Exhalimolobos, commonly known as the moonshade fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft blue glow at night. Native to the misty highlands of the Andes, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to spread slowly across forest floors, forming dense mats that retain moisture. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, translucent scales that reflect moonlight, aiding in its nocturnal illumination. Due to its rare habitat and slow growth, exhalimolobos is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
