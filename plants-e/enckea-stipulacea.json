    "intro": "Enckea stipulacea, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red sanders, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with prominent stipules. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, cherry-like fruits. Enckea stipulacea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. It also plays an important role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
