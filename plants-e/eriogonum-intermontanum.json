    "intro": "Eriogonum intermontanum, commonly known as the mountain globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky slopes and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Eriogonum intermontanum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
