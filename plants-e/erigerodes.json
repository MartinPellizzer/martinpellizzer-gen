    "intro": "Erigerodes, commonly known as the starry bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that often have a star-like appearance due to their five lobes. They are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in well-drained soils. Erigerodes species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens. The flowers are usually blue, purple, or white, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn."
