    "intro": "Euphorbia polygona var. anoplia, commonly known as the smoothleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling."
