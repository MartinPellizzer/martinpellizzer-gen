    "intro": "Erigeron concinnus var. eremicus, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
