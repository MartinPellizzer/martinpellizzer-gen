    "intro": "Euphorbia segetalis subsp. pinea, commonly known as the meadow spurge, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of xerophytic adaptations. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils."
