    "intro": "Euphorbia deflexa var. athoa, commonly known as the Athoan spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to survive in well-drained soils. This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
