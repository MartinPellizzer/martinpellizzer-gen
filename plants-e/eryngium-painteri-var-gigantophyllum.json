    "intro": "Eryngium painteri var. gigantophyllum, commonly known as the giant coneflower, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage with stiff, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
