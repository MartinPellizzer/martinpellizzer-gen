    "intro": "Eutassa subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf eutassa, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Eutassa subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal blooms."
