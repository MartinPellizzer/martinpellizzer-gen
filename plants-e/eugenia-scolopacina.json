    "intro": "Eugenia scolopacina, commonly known as the red-flowered eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible and often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Eugenia scolopacina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
