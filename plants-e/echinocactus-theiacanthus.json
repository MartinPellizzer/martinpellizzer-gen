    "intro": "Echinocactus theiacanthus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny exterior and a globular shape that becomes more rounded with age. The plant features a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem during the warmer months. This cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
