    "intro": "Euphorbia decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
