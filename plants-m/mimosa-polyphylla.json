    "intro": "Mimosa polyphylla, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa polyphylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate flowers."
