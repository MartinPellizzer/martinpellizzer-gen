    "intro": "Mammillaria glochidiata f. prolifera, commonly known as the branched mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which are typically shorter and more numerous than in the typical form. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its blue-gray foliage. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This variety is prized for its unique branching habit and ornamental value in rock gardens and succulent collections."
