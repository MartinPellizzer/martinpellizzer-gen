    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. rivulorum, commonly known as the river moorgrass, is a variant of the common moorgrass characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks, where it thrives in moist conditions. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple spikelets, which are its reproductive structures. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
