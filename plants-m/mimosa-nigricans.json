    "intro": "Mimosa nigricans, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, seed-filled pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings."
