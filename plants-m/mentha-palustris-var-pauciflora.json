    "intro": "Mentha palustris var. pauciflora, commonly known as the marsh mint, is a variant of the marsh mint species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
