    "intro": "Mimosa myriadenia var. egena, commonly known as the Egena mimosa, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or physical contact. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in small clusters, and it produces legume-like pods that contain seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry environments."
