    "intro": "Macrozamia moorei, commonly known as the Moore's cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more elongated than the male ones. It is adapted to low-nutrient soils and requires well-drained conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is listed as vulnerable in some regions."
