    "intro": "Mikania huaco, commonly known as the Peruvian morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Mikania huaco is often found in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides and in open forests, where it can quickly form dense thickets. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both an ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
