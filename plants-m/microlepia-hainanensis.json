    "intro": "Microlepia hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan microlepia, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microlepia hainanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
