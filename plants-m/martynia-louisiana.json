    "intro": "Martynia louisiana, commonly known as the redcurrant flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic compounds. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and invasive potential."
