    "intro": "Microlonchus tenellus, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems may be erect or floating. Microlonchus tenellus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
