    "intro": "Manettia ignita, commonly known as the fiery manettia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, bright red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and are often hidden beneath the striking red bracts. Manettia ignita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
