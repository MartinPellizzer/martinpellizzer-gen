    "intro": "Miconia multinervia var. minor, commonly known as the small-nerved miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by various bird species. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
