    "intro": "Maba mawambensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
