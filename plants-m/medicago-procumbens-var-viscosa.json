    "intro": "Medicago procumbens var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky medick, is a low-growing annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
