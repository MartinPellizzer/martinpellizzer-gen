    "intro": "Mikania tristachya, commonly known as climbing hemp or Mexican morning glory, is a vigorous annual vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth, slender stems, and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, winged seeds. It is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its aggressive spreading habit. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of soil types and environmental conditions."
