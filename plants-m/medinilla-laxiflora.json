    "intro": "Medinilla laxiflora, commonly known as the velvet tangerine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often resembling miniature roses. Medinilla laxiflora thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
