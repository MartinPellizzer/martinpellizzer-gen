    "intro": "Miconia floribunda, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Miconia floribunda is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in certain regions."
