    "intro": "Myosurus sessilis subsp. alopecuroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense clusters of bright red or orange tubular flowers that resemble a bottlebrush. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
