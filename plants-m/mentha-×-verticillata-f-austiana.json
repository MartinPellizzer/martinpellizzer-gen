It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
