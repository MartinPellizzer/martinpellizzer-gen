    "intro": "Medinilla calcicrassa, commonly known as the limestone medinilla, is a flowering plant native to the limestone regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom during the warm season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight to flourish. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
