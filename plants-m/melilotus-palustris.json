    "intro": "Melilotus palustris, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Swamp milkweed is adapted to moist soils and plays a vital role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
