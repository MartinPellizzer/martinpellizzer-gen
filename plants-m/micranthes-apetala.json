It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. It produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their lack of showy petals. Micranthes apetala is a perennial herb that thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in wetland habitats."
