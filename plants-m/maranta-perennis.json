    "intro": "Maranta perennis, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical perennial herb native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is valued for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. Its leaves are often variegated with shades of silver, green, and red, making it a popular houseplant. Maranta perennis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
