    "intro": "Malvastrum richii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, velvety leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Malvastrum richii is often found in rocky slopes and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
