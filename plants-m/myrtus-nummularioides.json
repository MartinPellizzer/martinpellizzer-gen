    "intro": "Myrtus nummularioides, commonly known as the silver myrtle or dwarf myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Myrtus nummularioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions."
