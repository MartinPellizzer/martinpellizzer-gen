    "intro": "Myrtus kalah, commonly known as the Kalah myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green leaves that are glossy and aromatic, often emitting a subtle scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. Myrtus kalah is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
