    "intro": "Miconia aguilarii, commonly known as the Guiana miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom during the wet season. It is often found in moist, tropical forests and can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
