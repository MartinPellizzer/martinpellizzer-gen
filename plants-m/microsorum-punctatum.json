The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to submerged surfaces, and its leaves are divided into small, rounded lobes. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Microsorum punctatum is also valued for its ability to help maintain water quality in aquariums."
