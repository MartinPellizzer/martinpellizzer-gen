    "intro": "Myristica subglobosa, commonly known as the globular nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the western Pacific, particularly Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by unique, three-lobed fruits that enclose the aromatic seeds used for culinary and medicinal purposes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a close relative of the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans, and its ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
