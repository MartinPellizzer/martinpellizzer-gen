    "intro": "Myosotis palustris subsp. repens, commonly known as the trailing water violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe. It features small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in shallow water or damp meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
