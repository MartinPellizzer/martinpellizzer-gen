    "intro": "Medicago rigidula f. subnudulosa, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. This subspecies is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other forms of Medicago rigidula."
