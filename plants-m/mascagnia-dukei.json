    "intro": "Mascagnia dukei, commonly known as the Duke's mescal bean, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many toxic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in drought conditions."
