    "intro": "Miconia leamollis, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruits are round, fleshy berries that turn red when mature, attracting various birds and mammals. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
