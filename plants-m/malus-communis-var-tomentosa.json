    "intro": "Malus communis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly apple tree, is a variant of the common apple tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, edible apples that are typically tart and not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and flowering display. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
