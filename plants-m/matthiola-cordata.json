    "intro": "Matthiola cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaved stock, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, four-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are heart-shaped, which gives the plant its common name, and they are typically hairy and slightly serrated. This annual or biennial plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
