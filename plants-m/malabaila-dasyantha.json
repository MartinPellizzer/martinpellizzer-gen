    "intro": "Malabaila dasyantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false mallow, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas."
