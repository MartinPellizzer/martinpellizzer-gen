    "intro": "Moehringia thesiifolia, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Moehringia thesiifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
