    "intro": "Medicago tetracycla var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal medic, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion. This variety is adapted to saline and well-drained conditions, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects."
