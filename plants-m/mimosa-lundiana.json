    "intro": "Mimosa lundiana, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it adaptable to various climates. Mimosa lundiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
