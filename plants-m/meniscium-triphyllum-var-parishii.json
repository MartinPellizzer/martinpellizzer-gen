    "intro": "Meniscium triphyllum var. parishii, commonly known as the three-leafed meniscium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
