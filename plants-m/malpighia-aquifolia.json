    "intro": "Malpighia aquifolia, commonly known as the water elder, is a shrub native to the wetlands and marshes of the southern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often submerged or floating, and its small, bright red berries that are edible for both humans and animals. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with its roots adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant's ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it a valuable indicator of wetland health."
