    "intro": "Melocactus pinguis var. planispinus, commonly known as the flat-spined melon cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to the dry forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its swollen, globular stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits resembling melons. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
