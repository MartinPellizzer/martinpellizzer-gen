    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 lykana, commonly known as hybrid mint, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha viridiflora (green mint). It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is perennial, growing up to 1 meter in height, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their strong menthol scent. Mentha \u00d7 lykana is also notable for its ability to hybridize with other mint species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the Mentha genus."
