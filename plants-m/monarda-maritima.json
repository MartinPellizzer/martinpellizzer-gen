    "intro": "Monarda maritima, commonly known as coastal bee balm, is a perennial herb native to the eastern coast of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic and have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. The plant is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy coastal species."
