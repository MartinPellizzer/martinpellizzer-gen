    "intro": "Mimosa velloziana var. inermis, commonly known as the soft mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that are soft and feathery. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods, a typical feature of the legume family, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance."
