    "intro": "Myrosmodes subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine snowbush, is a rare and delicate plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Myrosmodes subnivalis is found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, often at elevations above 2,000 meters."
