    "intro": "Mellera angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf mellera, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
