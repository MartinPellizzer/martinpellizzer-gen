It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers. This variety is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily through underground stems. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
