    "intro": "Miconia rhodantha, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia rhodantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and continuous flowering habit."
