    "intro": "Macrocarpaea kuelap, commonly known as the Kuelap macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
