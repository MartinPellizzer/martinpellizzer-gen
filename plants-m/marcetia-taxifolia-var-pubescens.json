    "intro": "Marcetia taxifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a variant of the common fern Marcetia taxifolia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, or pubescent, leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnate, with a slender, upright habit, and it produces spores in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
