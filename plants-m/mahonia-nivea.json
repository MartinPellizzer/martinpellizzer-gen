    "intro": "Mahonia nivea, commonly known as the snowberry mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its evergreen, holly-like leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers in early spring, followed by white, berry-like fruits that persist through the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Mahonia nivea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
