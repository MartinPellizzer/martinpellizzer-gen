    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. holubyana, commonly known as the Holubyana mint, is a variant of the field mint, characterized by its aromatic leaves and creeping growth habit. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream sides. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are rich in essential oils, containing menthol and other volatile compounds that give it a strong minty fragrance. This subspecies is valued both for its horticultural appeal and its potential use in herbal remedies."
