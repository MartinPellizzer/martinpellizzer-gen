It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and rapid growth habit, often reaching lengths of several meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
