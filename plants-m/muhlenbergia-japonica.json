    "intro": "Muhlenbergia japonica, commonly known as Japanese muhlenbergia, is a species of grass native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for wheat or other grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
