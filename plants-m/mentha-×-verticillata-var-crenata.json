    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. crenata, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with rhizomatous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily in moist environments. The leaves are lanceolate, serrated, and typically have a slightly hairy surface, while the flowers are small, tubular, and arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in herbal teas or as a ornamental plant in water gardens."
