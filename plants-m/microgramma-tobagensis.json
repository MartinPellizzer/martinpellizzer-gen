    "intro": "Microgramma tobagensis, commonly known as the Toba fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean island of Tobago. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Microgramma tobagensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
