    "intro": "Mezilaurus revolutifolia, commonly known as the Revolute-leaved Sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with a distinctive revolute margin, meaning the leaf edges roll under. It produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red fruits that contain a single seed. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
