    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. citriodora, commonly known as lemon mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid form of Mentha aquatica, characterized by its distinct lemon-scented leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, with a fragrant, citrus-like aroma that is more pronounced than in other mint species. The flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple, appearing in spikes during the summer months."
