    "intro": "Monocera aromatica, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent due to their pleasant, vanilla-like scent. Monocera aromatica thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas."
