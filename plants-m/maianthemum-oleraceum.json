    "intro": "Maianthemum oleraceum, commonly known as the clustered yellow bellwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a low-growing habit with rhizomatous stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and they bloom in early to mid-summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in forest understories."
