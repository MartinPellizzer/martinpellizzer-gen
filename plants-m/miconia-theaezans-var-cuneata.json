    "intro": "Miconia theaezans var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
