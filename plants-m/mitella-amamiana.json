    "intro": "Mitella amamiana, commonly known as the Amami mitella, is a rare flowering plant native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered white flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, dark berries that mature in the fall. Due to habitat loss, Mitella amamiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
