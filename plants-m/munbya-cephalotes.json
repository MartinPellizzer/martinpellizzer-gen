    "intro": "Munbya cephalotes, commonly known as the hairy antplant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, providing shelter and food in exchange for protection from herbivores. The plant's structure includes a dense mat of hair-like structures that aid in moisture retention and support its climbing growth habit. Its leaves are typically small, broad, and have a velvety texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant-animal interactions in tropical ecosystems."
