    "intro": "Miconia moensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is also known for its distinctive, persistent fruits that are capsule-like and contain numerous small seeds. Miconia moensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is considered an important component of Hawaii's native flora."
