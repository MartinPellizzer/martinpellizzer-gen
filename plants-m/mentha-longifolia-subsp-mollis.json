    "intro": "Mentha longifolia subsp. mollis, commonly known as marsh mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and square stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and woodlands. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin and emit a strong menthol-like fragrance when crushed. This subspecies is often used in herbal medicine for its cooling and digestive properties."
