    "intro": "Medicago arenaria, commonly known as sand medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and erosion control. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
