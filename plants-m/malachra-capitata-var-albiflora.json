    "intro": "Malachra capitata var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a dense cluster of small, white flowers at the top of a tall, slender stem, which bloom in late summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and the plant exudes a milky sap when damaged. This variety is distinguished by its pale flowers and is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows."
