    "intro": "Melastoma constrictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf melastoma, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly waxy texture. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
