    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. scutellata, commonly known as the scarlet vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and dry conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Its seeds are small and oblong, with a distinctive scutellate (shield-like) structure on the seed coat."
