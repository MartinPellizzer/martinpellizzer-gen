It is characterized by its intricate, branching structure that resembles coral, giving it its common name. The plant has small, oval leaves that are usually tightly packed along the stems. It is typically found in temperate regions, often in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to humid, shaded habitats."
