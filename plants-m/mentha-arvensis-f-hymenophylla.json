    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. hymenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf field mint, is a horticultural form of the broadleaf mint. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Mentha arvensis. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is a perennial herb that prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade."
