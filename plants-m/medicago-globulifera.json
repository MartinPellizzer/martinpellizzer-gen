    "intro": "Medicago globulifera, commonly known as the globular vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, globular seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds, a feature that aids in its reproductive strategy. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Medicago globulifera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
