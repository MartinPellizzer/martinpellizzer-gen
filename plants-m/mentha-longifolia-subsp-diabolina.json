    "intro": "Mentha longifolia subsp. diabolina, commonly known as devil's mint, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, peppery aroma. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorls along the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Due to its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique scent and potential medicinal applications."
