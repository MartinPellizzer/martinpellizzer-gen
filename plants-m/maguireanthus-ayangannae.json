    "intro": "Maguireanthus ayangannae, commonly known as the Ayangannan Flamebloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Ayanganna rainforest. It features striking, vibrant orange-red petals that resemble flames, with a central cluster of yellow stamens. The plant has a unique, branched stem structure and waxy, broad leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. Its flowers bloom once a year, typically during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators like the Ayanganna hummingbird. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
