    "intro": "Marsilea trifolia, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, typically with four lobes. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structure includes small, spore-producing structures called sporocarps, which are often found on the underside of its leaves. Marsilea trifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
