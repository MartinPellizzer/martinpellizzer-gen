It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and white, woolly spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in the evening. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
