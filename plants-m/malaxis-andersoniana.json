    "intro": "Malaxis andersoniana, commonly known as the Anderson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by specific insects, such as bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis andersoniana is considered a threatened species."
