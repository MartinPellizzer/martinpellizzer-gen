    "intro": "Mariscus goniobolbus var. perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's mariscus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Mariscus genus. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
