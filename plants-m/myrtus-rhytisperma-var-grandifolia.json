    "intro": "Myrtus rhytisperma var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, leathery berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions."
