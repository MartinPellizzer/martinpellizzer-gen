    "intro": "Matayba marginata, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lythraceae. It is native to coastal areas of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in brackish or saline water environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are often yellowish-green in color. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract various pollinators. Matayba marginata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
