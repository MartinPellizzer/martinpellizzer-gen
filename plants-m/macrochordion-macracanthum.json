It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
