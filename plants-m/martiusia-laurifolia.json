    "intro": "Martiusia laurifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf martiusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
