    "intro": "Merendera trigyna subsp. eichleri, commonly known as the Eichler's merendera, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
