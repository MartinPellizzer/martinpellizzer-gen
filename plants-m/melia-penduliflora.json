    "intro": "Melia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower melia, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that hang in clusters, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Melia penduliflora is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
