    "intro": "Medinilla buennemeyeri, commonly known as the velvet tangerine. This tropical evergreen shrub is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla buennemeyeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
