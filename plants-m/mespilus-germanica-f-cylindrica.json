    "intro": "Mespilus germanica f. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical medlar, is a unique cultivar of the medlar tree. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical fruit shape, which distinguishes it from the typical round medlar fruits. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters, and it produces fruit in the autumn. The cylindrical medlar is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
