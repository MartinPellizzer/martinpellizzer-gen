    "intro": "Mikania brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and hairy stems. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, followed by spherical, hairy fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and can spread aggressively. Mikania brachycarpa is often considered a weed due to its invasive tendencies in disturbed habitats."
