    "intro": "Milium treutleri, commonly known as the slender millet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Milium treutleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
