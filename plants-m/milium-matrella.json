    "intro": "Milium matrella, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. Milium matrella is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
