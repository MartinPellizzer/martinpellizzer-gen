It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its narrow, linear leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers.
