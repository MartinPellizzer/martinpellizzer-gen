    "intro": "Mercurialis annua var. intermixta, commonly known as the mixed mercury plant, is a variant of the common mercury plant, characterized by its variable leaf morphology. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features lobed or trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability and role in ecological succession. It is also noted for its toxic properties due to the presence of mercury compounds."
