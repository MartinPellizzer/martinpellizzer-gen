    "intro": "Medicago obscura, commonly known as the obscure medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Medicago obscura is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural settings."
