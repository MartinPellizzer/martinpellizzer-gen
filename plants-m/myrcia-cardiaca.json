    "intro": "Myrcia cardiaca, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Myrcia cardiaca thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal regions. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
