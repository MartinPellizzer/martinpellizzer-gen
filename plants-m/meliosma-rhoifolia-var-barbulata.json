    "intro": "Meliosma rhoifolia var. barbulata, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
