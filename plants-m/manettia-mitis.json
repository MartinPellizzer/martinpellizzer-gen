    "intro": "Manettia mitis, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of other trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together, and its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Manettia mitis has a complex relationship with its host, sometimes causing stress or even death to the tree if the infestation is severe. Its presence in ecosystems can influence local biodiversity and plant community dynamics."
