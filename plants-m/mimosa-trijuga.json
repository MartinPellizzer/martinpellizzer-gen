    "intro": "Mimosa trijuga, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa trijuga is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also studied for its unique physiological responses."
