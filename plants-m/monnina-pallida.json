    "intro": "Monnina pallida, commonly known as pale monnina, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Monnina pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
