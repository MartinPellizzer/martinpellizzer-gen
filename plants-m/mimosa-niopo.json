    "intro": "Mimosa niopo, commonly known as the Hawaiian mimosa, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Mimosa niopo plays a role in stabilizing soils and provides habitat for native insects and birds."
