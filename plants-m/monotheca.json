    "intro": "Monotheca, commonly known as the single chamber, is a botanical term referring to a type of seed pod or fruit that develops from a single carpel. This structure typically consists of a single chamber or locule, which contains the seeds. Monotheca is characteristic of certain plant families, such as the Malvaceae, where it often forms a capsule or a schizocarp. The term is used to describe the internal anatomy of the fruit rather than its external appearance. It plays a role in the dispersal and protection of seeds within the plant's reproductive cycle."
