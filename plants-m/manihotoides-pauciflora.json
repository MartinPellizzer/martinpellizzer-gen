    "intro": "Manihotoides pauciflora, commonly known as the rare desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers typically bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
