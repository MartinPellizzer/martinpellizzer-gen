    "intro": "Mammillaria ascensionis, commonly known as the Ascension Island cactus, is a species native to the remote Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with full sun exposure. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
