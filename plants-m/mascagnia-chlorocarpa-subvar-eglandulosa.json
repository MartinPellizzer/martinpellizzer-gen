    "intro": "Mascagnia chlorocarpa subvar. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular mascagnia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
