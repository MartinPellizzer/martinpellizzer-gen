    "intro": "Moehringia trinervia var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate moehringia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
