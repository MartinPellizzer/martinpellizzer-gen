    "intro": "Myagrum saxatile, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Myagrum saxatile plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
