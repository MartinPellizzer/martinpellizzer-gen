    "intro": "Macrocnemum candidissimum, commonly known as the white-flowered spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by bright yellow bracts. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
