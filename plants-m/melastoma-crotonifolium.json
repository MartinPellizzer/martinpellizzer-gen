    "intro": "Melastoma crotonifolium, commonly known as the red-flowered melastoma, is a perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Melastoma crotonifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
