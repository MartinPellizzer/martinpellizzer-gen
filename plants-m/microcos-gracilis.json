    "intro": "Microcos gracilis, commonly known as the slender microcos, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, narrow leaves arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on slender, branching stems and are often mistaken for weeds due to their small size. Microcos gracilis is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
