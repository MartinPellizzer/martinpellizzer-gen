    "intro": "Mercurialis annua var. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated mercury plant, is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its alternate, serrated leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
