    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum furfureum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Mesembryanthemum furfureum is a popular ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and vibrant floral display."
