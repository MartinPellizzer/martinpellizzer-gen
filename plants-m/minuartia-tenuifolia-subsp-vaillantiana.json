    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia subsp. vaillantiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock\u767d\u83dc, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
