    "intro": "Macaglia refracta, commonly known as the refracted macaglia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
