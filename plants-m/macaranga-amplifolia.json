It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Macaranga amplifolia is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
