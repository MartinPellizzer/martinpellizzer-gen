    "intro": "Mammillaria mixtecensis, commonly known as the Mixtec Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a low-growing cactus with a compact, rounded stem that is typically covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
