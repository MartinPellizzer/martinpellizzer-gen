    "intro": "Momordica cucullata, commonly known as the horned cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive horn-shaped fruit, which can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is edible when mature, though it has a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and culinary uses."
