    "intro": "Maxillaria acervata, commonly known as the clustered maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, and its flowers are often adorned with intricate patterns and contrasting markings. Maxillaria acervata prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
