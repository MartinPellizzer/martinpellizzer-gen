    "intro": "Medicago heterocarpa, commonly known as the woolly medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, inflated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Medicago heterocarpa is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
