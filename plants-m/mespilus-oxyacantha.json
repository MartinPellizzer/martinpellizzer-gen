    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark blue berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and are typically dark green in color. The blackthorn is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
