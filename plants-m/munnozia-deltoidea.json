    "intro": "Munnozia deltoidea, commonly known as the delta mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Munnozia deltoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
