    "intro": "Mikania gonoclada var. ambigua, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in many areas. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, giving the plant its common name."
