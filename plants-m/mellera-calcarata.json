    "intro": "Mellera calcarata, commonly known as the rock mulberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible berries, which are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
