    "intro": "Melaleuca cajuputi, commonly known as paperbark tree, is a species of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae) native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca cajuputi is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
