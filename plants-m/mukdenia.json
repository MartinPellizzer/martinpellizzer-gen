    "intro": "Mukdenia, commonly known as the Chinese snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to eastern Asia. The plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Mukdenia species typically bloom in spring and are often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, though they are not widely cultivated outside their native range."
