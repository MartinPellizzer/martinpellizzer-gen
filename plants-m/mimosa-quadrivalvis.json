    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapt well to various soil types, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique leaf movements and delicate appearance."
