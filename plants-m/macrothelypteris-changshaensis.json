    "intro": "Macrothelypteris changshaensis, commonly known as the Changsha cliff fern, is a species of tree fern native to southern China. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures that help retain moisture, an adaptation to its often moist, tropical habitat. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
