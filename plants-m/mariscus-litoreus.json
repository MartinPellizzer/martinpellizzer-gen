    "intro": "Mariscus litoreus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-green, lance-shaped leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along shores and dunes. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries. Mariscus litoreus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
