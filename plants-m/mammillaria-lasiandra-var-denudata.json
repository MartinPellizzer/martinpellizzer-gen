    "intro": "Mammillaria lasiandra var. denudata, commonly known as the naked mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hair that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. This variety is prized for its unique texture and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
