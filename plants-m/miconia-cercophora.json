    "intro": "Miconia cercophora, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white or silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that contain numerous seeds. Miconia cercophora is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
