    "intro": "Myristica pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf nutmeg, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that yield edible fruits. The fruit contains a single seed, which is used to produce a spice similar to nutmeg. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
