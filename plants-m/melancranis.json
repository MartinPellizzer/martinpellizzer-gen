    "intro": "Melancranis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Melancranis is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
