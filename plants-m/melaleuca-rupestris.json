    "intro": "Melaleuca rupestris, commonly known as the stony melaleuca, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for native wildlife. Melaleuca rupestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
