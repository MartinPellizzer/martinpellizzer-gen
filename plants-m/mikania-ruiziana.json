    "intro": "Mikania ruiziana, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous, climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive greenish-white underside. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in clusters. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread over other vegetation, making it an invasive species in some regions. Mikania ruiziana is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in moist woodland habitats."
