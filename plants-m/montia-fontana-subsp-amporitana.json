    "intro": "Montia fontana subsp. amporitana, commonly known as the mountain waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky slopes. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its small, white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other members of the Montia genus."
