    "intro": "Meibomia arenaria, commonly known as the sand meibomia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Meibomia arenaria is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for native insects."
