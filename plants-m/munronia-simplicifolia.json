    "intro": "Munronia simplicifolia, commonly known as the simpleleaf munronia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually smooth and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. These flowers give way to distinctive, showy red berries that persist into the winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
