    "intro": "Marsilea burchellii, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Africa. It has four small, floating leaves that resemble a clover, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and slightly notched. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are usually submerged, followed by dark, bean-like fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Marsilea burchellii is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to help control algae growth."
