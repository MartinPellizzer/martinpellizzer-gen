    "intro": "Micromeria croatica var. panciciana, commonly known as the Croatian micromeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
