    "intro": "Merremia linearifolia, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant's stems are hairy and can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
