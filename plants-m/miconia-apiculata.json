    "intro": "Miconia apiculata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and have a velvety texture. Miconia apiculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking appearance."
