    "intro": "Marasmodes reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed marasmodes, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its reflexed, often hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
