    "intro": "Miconia racemosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
