It is characterized by its small, waxy, yellowish-green leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Myrica punctata typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
