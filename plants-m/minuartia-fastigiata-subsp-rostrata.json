    "intro": "Minuartia fastigiata subsp. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, rostrate (beak-like) stigma, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
