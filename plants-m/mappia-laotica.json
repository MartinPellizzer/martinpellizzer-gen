It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and elliptical, dark green leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mappia laotica is considered a vulnerable species."
