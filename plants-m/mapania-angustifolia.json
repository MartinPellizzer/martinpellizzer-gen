    "intro": "Mapania angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mapania, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody structure allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and partial shade. Mapania angustifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
