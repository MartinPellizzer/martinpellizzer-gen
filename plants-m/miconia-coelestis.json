    "intro": "Miconia coelestis, commonly known as the sky blue miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that are often surrounded by bright blue bracts, giving it its striking appearance. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in rainforests. Miconia coelestis is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
