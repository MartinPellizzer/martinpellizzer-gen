    "intro": "Marrubiastrum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly marrubia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
