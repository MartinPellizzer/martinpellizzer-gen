    "intro": "Microchilus dressleri, commonly known as the Dressler's microchilus, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
