    "intro": "Miconia majalis, commonly known as the silverleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a strong, acidic taste. Miconia majalis is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
