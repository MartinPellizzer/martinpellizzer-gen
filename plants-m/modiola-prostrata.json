    "intro": "Modiola prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate marsh gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Modiola prostrata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides nectar for various pollinators."
