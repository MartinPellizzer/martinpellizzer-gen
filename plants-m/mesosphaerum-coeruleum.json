    "intro": "Mesosphaerum coeruleum, commonly known as the blue globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Mesosphaerum coeruleum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
