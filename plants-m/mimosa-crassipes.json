    "intro": "Mimosa crassipes, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and along roadsides. Mimosa crassipes is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
