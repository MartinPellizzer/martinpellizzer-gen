    "intro": "Malva striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green stripe running down the central vein. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Malva striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
