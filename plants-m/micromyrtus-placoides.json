    "intro": "Micromyrtus placoides, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its flowers are tubular and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Micromyrtus placoides is often found growing in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
