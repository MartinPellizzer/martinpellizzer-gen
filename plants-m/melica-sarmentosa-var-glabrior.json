    "intro": "Melica sarmentosa var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth\u530d\u5310grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features slender, often hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It thrives in moist, often disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties within the species."
