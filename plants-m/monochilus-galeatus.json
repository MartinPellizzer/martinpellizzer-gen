It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers often bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems.
