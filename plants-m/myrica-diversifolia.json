    "intro": "Myrica diversifolia, commonly known as the variable wax myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a whitish wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. Myrica diversifolia thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
