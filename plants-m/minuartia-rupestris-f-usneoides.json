    "intro": "Minuartia rupestris f. usneoides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit allows it to thrive in crevices and on rock surfaces, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
