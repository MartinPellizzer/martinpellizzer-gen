    "intro": "Myrica longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf myrica, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica longifolia plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and contributing to wetland biodiversity."
