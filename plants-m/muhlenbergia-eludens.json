    "intro": "Muhlenbergia eludens, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton or fluff, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia eludens is often used in native plant gardens for its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
