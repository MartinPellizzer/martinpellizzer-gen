It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of white or pink. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. The fruit is a small, red drupe that ripens in late summer, making it an attractive addition to ornamental gardens."
