    "intro": "Microchilus erythrodoides subsp. venadosae, commonly known as the Venadosae orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a combination of red and yellow hues, which are adapted for specific pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its botanical features include narrow, strap-like leaves and a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
