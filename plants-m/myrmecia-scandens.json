    "intro": "Myrmecia scandens, commonly known as the climbing bull ant, is a species of ant that exhibits unique botanical interactions. It is native to Australia and is often found in shrubland and woodland habitats. The plant does not directly contribute to the ant's life cycle but is part of the ecosystem that supports its habitat. Myrmecia scandens is not a plant itself but a species of ant, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. Therefore, there may be a confusion in the query, as the term refers to an insect rather than a plant."
