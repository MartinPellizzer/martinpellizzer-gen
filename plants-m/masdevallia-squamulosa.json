    "intro": "Masdevallia squamulosa, commonly known as the scaly masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features elongated, pleated leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are usually borne on short peduncles and are composed of three sepals and three petals, with the lip being distinctive in shape and color. Masdevallia squamulosa thrives in cool, humid environments and requires high light levels but is sensitive to direct sunlight."
