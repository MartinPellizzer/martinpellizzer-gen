    "intro": "Macfadyena cynanchoides, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, South America, and Asia. It is a climbing vine characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the evening. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
