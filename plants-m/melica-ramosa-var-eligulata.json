    "intro": "Melica ramosa var. eligulata, commonly known as the slender wood grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and riparian areas. Due to its delicate structure and ecological importance, it is often found in wetland ecosystems."
