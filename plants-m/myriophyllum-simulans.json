It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Myriophyllum simulans is often found in shallow waters and can form dense underwater stands, influencing aquatic ecosystems."
