    "intro": "Maesobotrya sapinii var. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The leaves turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value."
