    "intro": "Medicago sphaerocarpos var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, spherical pods that lack the bristly hairs found in other varieties of Medicago. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It has trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
