    "intro": "Monanthium, commonly known as the single-flower grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and typically produces a single spikelet of flowers at the tip of each stem. The plants are native to North America and often grow in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Monanthium species are generally herbaceous and have fibrous roots, with narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense rosette. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
