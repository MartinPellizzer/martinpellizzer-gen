    "intro": "Melochia chamaedrys var. loretensis, commonly known as the creeping melochia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
