    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. granitzensis, commonly known as the Granitzens' water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It is a hybrid species within the Mentha genus, characterized by its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats. The plant features aromatic, lanceolate leaves and produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters.
