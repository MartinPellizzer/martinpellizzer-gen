    "intro": "Microstachys scoparia, commonly known as the small-stemmed grass. It is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its low-growing nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
