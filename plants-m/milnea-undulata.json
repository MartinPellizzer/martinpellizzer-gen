    "intro": "Milnea undulata, commonly known as the wavy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with wavy edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Milnea undulata is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on its milkweed for laying eggs."
