    "intro": "Marginaria guttata, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters. The plant has thin, branching stems covered with tiny, translucent leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight. Its flowers are typically small and white, with four petals arranged in a cross shape. Marginaria guttata plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
