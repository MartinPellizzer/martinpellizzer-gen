    "intro": "Melaleuca beaufortioides var. lachnosanthe, commonly known as the Broad-leaf Melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, often grey-green leaves and its showy, bottlebrush-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, woody fruits called capsules, which release tiny seeds when mature. It typically grows in well-drained soils in coastal and sandy areas, and is adapted to withstand salt spray and drought. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
