    "intro": "Mimosa sevilhae, commonly known as the Seville mimosa, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
