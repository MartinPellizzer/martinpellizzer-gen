    "intro": "Myrica reticulata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrant oils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica reticulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
