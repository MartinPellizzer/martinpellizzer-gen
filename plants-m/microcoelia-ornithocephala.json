    "intro": "Microcoelia ornithocephala, commonly known as the bird-headed lichen, is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, tightly adherent growth on rock surfaces. It is characterized by a bright yellow to orange thallus with a distinctive, bird-like head-shaped apothecium. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in harsh, arid environments. It is typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as rock crevices and soil surfaces. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to lichenologists and conservationists."
