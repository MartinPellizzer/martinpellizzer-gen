    "intro": "Malaxis compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky slopes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Malaxis compressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
