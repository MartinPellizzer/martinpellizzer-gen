    "intro": "Muscari populeum, commonly known as the woodland grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the woodlands of Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize easily. Muscari populeum is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators during the early growing season."
