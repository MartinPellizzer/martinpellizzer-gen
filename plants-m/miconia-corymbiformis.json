    "intro": "Miconia corymbiformis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or false mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia corymbiformis is known for its rapid growth and is often used in ornamental horticulture. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
