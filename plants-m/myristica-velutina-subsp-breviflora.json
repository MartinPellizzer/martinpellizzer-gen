    "intro": "Myristica velutina subsp. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of about 10 meters, characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its most notable botanical feature is the aromatic, oily seed kernel, which is closely related to the spice nutmeg but is less commonly used in commercial applications."
