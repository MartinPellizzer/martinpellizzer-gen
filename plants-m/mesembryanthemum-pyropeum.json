It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic landscaping."
