It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
