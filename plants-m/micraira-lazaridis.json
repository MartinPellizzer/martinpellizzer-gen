    "intro": "Micraira lazaridis, commonly known as the Lazaridis' micraira, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Micraira lazaridis is considered a species of conservation concern."
