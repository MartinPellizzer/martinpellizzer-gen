    "intro": "Manisuris santapaui, commonly known as the Santa Paula manisuris, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under local conservation efforts."
