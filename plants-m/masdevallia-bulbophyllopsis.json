    "intro": "Masdevallia bulbophyllopsis, commonly known as the bulbophyllopsis masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flower structure with a unique, bulb-like appendage on the lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is challenging to cultivate outside its native range."
