It features spiny, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a distinctive yellowish-green underside. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
