    "intro": "Mimosa colubrina, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Mimosa colubrina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and sandy soils."
