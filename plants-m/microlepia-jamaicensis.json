    "intro": "Microlepia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican chain fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and parts of the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arched fronds that form a cascading effect. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually bioluminescent under certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant in its habitat."
