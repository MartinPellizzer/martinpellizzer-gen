    "intro": "Malcolmia flexuosa subsp. flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping mallows, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in dry, rocky soils and full sun. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
