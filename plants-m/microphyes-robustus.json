    "intro": "Microphyes robustus, commonly known as the hardy marsh fern, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Microphyes robustus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
