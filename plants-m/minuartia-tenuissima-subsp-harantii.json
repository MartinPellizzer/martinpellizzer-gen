    "intro": "Minuartia tenuissima subsp. harantii, commonly known as the Harant's rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a dense covering of fine, hair-like structures that help it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high sunlight exposure. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare species in some regions."
