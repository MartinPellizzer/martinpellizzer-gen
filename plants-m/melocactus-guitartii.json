    "intro": "Melocactus guitartii, commonly known as the guitar cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, ribbed stem that resembles the shape of a guitar, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and has a short, thick trunk with a crown of spines. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom during the rainy season. Melocactus guitartii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick stem and minimizing water loss through its spines."
