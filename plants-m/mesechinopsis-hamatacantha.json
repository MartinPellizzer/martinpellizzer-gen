It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
