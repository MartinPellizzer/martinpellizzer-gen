It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pentapetalous flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
