    "intro": "Mertensia speluncae, commonly known as the cave mertensia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in dark, humid cave environments. It possesses large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of moss or algae, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on heterotrophic nutrition, obtaining nutrients from decaying organic matter in the cave. Its flowers, when they do appear, are typically pale blue or white, adapted to attract scarce pollinators. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Mertensia speluncae is considered a vulnerable species with significant ecological and scientific interest."
