    "intro": "Manniophyton, commonly known as the African water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often divided into four lobes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, seed-like propagules that allow it to spread vegetatively. Manniophyton plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
