    "intro": "Miconia ciliata var. congestiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
