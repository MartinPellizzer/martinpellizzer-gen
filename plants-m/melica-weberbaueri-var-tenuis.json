    "intro": "Melica weberbaueri var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
