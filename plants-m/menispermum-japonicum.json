It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and growth patterns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
