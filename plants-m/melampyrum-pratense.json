    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense, commonly known as yellow cow-wheat, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its roots. It typically grows in moist meadows and woodlands, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched."
