    "intro": "Miconia cinerascens, commonly known as the silver miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
