    "intro": "Monanthotaxis discrepantinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined monanthotaxis, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees. The plant is characterized by its slender, evergreen stems and small, clustered leaves with distinctive, parallel venation. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature known as monoecious. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
