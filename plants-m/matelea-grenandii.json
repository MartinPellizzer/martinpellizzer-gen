    "intro": "Matelea grenandii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is a climbing shrub that produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm regions as a decorative plant."
