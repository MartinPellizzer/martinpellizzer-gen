    "intro": "Myoxanthus scandens, commonly known as the climbing false nettle, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along the ground or other vegetation. Botanically, it belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants."
