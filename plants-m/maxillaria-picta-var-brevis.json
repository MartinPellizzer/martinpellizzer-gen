It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant produces intricate, often colorful blooms with a distinctive pattern of markings on the petals and sepals. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
