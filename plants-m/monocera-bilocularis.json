    "intro": "Monocera bilocularis, commonly known as the two-chambered monocera, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct chambers within the ovary, which is a rare trait among angiosperms. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy surface, while its flowers are showy and predominantly yellow or orange in color. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Monocera bilocularis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
