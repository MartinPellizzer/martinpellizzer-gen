    "intro": "Matteuccia pensylvanica f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent barren gentian, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. The fronds are bipinnate, with a light green color and a dense covering of fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sorus. This fern is often found in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada."
