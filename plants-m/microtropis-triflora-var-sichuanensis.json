    "intro": "Microtropis triflora var. sichuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan microtropis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
