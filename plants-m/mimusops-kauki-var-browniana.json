    "intro": "Mimusops kauki var. browniana, commonly known as the brown ivory tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in carving and construction."
