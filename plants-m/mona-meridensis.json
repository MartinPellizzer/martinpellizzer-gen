    "intro": "Mona meridensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the genus Aconitum and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of dark purple to blue flowers. The plant has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
