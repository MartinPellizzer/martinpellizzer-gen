    "intro": "Mertensia longiflora var. pulchella, commonly known as the showy bluebells, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers in early spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and long-lasting blooms."
