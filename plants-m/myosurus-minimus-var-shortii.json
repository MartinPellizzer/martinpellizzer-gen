    "intro": "Myosurus minimus var. shortii, commonly known as the dwarf mosquito plant, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe. It features tiny, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
