It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with prominent, petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often hairy. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
