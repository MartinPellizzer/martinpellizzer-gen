    "intro": "Musa acuminata var. nakaii, commonly known as the Nakai's banana, is a variety of banana plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often curved leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of elongated, yellowish-green fruit that are typically harvested when they are still unripe. It is a diploid species, meaning it has two sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic stability. This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in breeding programs to develop new banana cultivars."
