    "intro": "Messerschmidia rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the mountain thyme or rock thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of thyme. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental and aromatic qualities."
