    "intro": "Manihot rotundata, commonly known as cassava, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces large, heart-shaped leaves and develops tuberous roots as its primary storage organ. The plant is cultivated for its starchy roots, which are a staple food in many tropical regions. Its growth is typically adapted to warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its nutrient uptake."
