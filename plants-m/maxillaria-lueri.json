    "intro": "Maxillaria lueri, commonly known as the Luer's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically features elongated, leathery leaves and has a pseudobulb structure that helps it store water. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria lueri is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
