    "intro": "Myristica myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring hollow stems that provide shelter for ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which reside in the hollow structures and protect the plant from herbivores. Myristica myrmecophila also produces fragrant, yellowish flowers and develops distinctive fruit capsules. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of plant-animal interactions in tropical ecosystems."
