    "intro": "Micheliella, commonly known as the \"flowering grass\" or \"false brome,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spikelets, which are the basic flowering units of grasses. Micheliella species are often found in temperate regions and can thrive in a variety of soil types. These plants are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
