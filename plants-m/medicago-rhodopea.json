It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry and rocky habitats, often found in Mediterranean climates. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Medicago rhodopea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
