It features long, narrow leaves with a distinctive red or orange coloration along the midrib, giving it its vibrant appearance. The plant has a rhizomatic growth habit, allowing it to spread across the substrate in aquariums. Its leaves are often used in planted tanks for both aesthetic appeal and biological filtration. It prefers moderate to high light and nutrient-rich water conditions for optimal growth."
