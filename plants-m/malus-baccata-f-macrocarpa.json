    "intro": "Malus baccata f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited crabapple, is a cultivar of the crabapple tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from white to pink, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces edible, sweet-tart fruits that are typically larger than those of other crabapple varieties. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding to its aesthetic appeal."
