    "intro": "Meibomia guaranitica var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited meibomia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies in its native habitat. The variety microcarpa is distinguished by its smaller fruit size compared to other varieties of Meibomia."
