    "intro": "Matelea pseudobarbata, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance at night to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant's leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, adding to its distinctive appearance."
