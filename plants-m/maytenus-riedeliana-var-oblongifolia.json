It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, fleshy berries that are red when mature.

Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
