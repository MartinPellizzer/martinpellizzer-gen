    "intro": "Mammillaria senckii, commonly known as the Senck's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid climates. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
