    "intro": "Mondo planiscapum, commonly known as the flatleaf mondo grass, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a mat-like growth habit, typically reaching heights of less than 6 inches. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. Its foliage is resistant to most pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shady, moist environments. Mondo planiscapum thrives in partial to full shade and requires moderate watering for optimal growth."
