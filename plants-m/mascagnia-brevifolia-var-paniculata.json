    "intro": "Mascagnia brevifolia var. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled mascagnia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in its native range."
