    "intro": "Miconia lutescens, commonly known as the yellow miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in tropical rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
