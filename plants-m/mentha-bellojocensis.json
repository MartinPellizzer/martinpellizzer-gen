    "intro": "Mentha bellojocensis, commonly known as the Bellojocensis mint, is a rare and lesser-known species of the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves that emit a strong menthol scent when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its small, tubular flowers are usually purple or blue, arranged in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species."
