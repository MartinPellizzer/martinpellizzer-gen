    "intro": "Macleania epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic bromeliad, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients from rain. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Macleania epiphytica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
