    "intro": "Milium transsilvanicum var. lerchenfeldianum, commonly known as the Lerchenfeld's millet, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that adds to its ornamental value. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its low maintenance requirements."
