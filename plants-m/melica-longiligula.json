    "intro": "Melica longiligula, commonly known as the long-leaf melica, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three small, spikelet-like flowers. Melica longiligula is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
