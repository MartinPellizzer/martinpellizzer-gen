    "intro": "Microstegium elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its stems are typically prostrate, and it spreads by stolons, forming dense mats. Microstegium elmeri is characterized by its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
