    "intro": "Medicago falcata subsp. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered medick, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, globular clusters of pods, which give it its subspecific name \"glomerata.\" It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
