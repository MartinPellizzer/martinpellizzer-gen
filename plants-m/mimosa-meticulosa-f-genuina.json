    "intro": "Mimosa meticulosa f. genuina, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a cultivar of the mimosa plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy pink flowers. It is native to South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small,\u7ed2\u6bdb-covered pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade. The leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty."
