    "intro": "Malache involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Malache involucrata is often found in moist, shaded areas and can be invasive in certain regions."
