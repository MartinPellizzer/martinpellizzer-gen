    "intro": "Monticalia flosfragrans var. frigidophila, commonly known as the cold-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, wiry stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
