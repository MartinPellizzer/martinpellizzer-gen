    "intro": "Magnolia cristalensis subsp. baracoana, commonly known as the Baracoana magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white to cream-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
