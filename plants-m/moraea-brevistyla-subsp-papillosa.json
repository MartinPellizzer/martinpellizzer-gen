It typically grows in grassland and rocky habitats, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. Its inflorescence is a dense cluster of blooms, often arranged in a cylindrical or spiky form. The subspecies is characterized by the presence of papillae, small raised structures on the petals, which give it its distinctive appearance."
