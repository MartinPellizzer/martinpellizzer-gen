    "intro": "Miscanthus brevipilus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silver grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching culms that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fluffy, feathery panicles that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its low maintenance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to ecological landscapes."
