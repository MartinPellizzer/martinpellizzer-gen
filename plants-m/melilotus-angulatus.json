    "intro": "Melilotus angulatus, commonly known as angular melilot, is an annual legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits that contain several small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
