Its fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a delicate, feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
