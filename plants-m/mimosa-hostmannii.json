    "intro": "Mimosa hostmannii, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold inward when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some regions. Mimosa hostmannii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
