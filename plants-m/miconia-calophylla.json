    "intro": "Miconia calophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropics. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Miconia calophylla is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its ecological impact is significant due to its competitive nature and ability to alter local ecosystems."
