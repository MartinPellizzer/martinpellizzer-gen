    "intro": "Mentha crispata, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Mentha crispata is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
