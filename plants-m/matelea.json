    "intro": "Matelea, commonly known as the \"Mexican moonflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Mexico and Central America, and are known for their large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and have a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Matelea species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. They have a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested."
