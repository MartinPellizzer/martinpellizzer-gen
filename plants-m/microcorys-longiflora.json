    "intro": "Microcorys longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered microcorys, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, slender stems and clustered, elongated flowers. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, greenish-white flowers with prominent lips, typical of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
