    "intro": "Modecca membranifolia, commonly known as the paper-leaf modecca, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, thin, and often translucent leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in spikes, and are usually white or pale yellow. Modecca membranifolia is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and air-purifying qualities."
