    "intro": "Melocactus compactus, commonly known as the compact melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces a single, large, spiny fruit that is often yellow or orange in color. Its flowers are typically yellow or red and bloom during the warm season. This cactus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick stem for survival."
