It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a climbing or trailing form, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Mitracarpus filipes is valued not only for its edible seeds but also for its ornamental appeal and role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
