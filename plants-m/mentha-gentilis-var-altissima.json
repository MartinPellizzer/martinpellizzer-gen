    "intro": "Mentha gentilis var. altissima, commonly known as tall meadow mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Mentha gentilis var. altissima is often found in moist meadows, stream sides, and other damp habitats."
