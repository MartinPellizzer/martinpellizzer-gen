    "intro": "Melicytus venosus, commonly known as the veiny tree or k\u014dwhai k\u014dtukutuku, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive veined leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated by birds, particularly the native kerer\u016b. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
