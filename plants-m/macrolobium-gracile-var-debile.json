    "intro": "Macrolobium gracile var. debile, commonly known as the slender leaf macrolobium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is generally shrub-like, with a compact form and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
