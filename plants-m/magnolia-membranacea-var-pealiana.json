    "intro": "Magnolia membranacea var. pealiana, commonly known as the Pealian magnolia, is a rare and ornamental species native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, broad leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
