It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that are often wrinkled and have a strong menthol scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other mints in the Mentha genus."
