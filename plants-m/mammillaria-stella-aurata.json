    "intro": "Mammillaria stella-aurata, commonly known as the starry star cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, star-shaped tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 7 centimeters and has a slow growth rate. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
