    "intro": "Machaerina melicoides, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Machaerina melicoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
