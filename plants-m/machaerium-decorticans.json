    "intro": "Machaerium decorticans, commonly known as the African velvetbean, is a tropical legume native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are used as a food source in some regions. Machaerium decorticans is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural systems."
