It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
