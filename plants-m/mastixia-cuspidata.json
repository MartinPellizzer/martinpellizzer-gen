It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The tree is valued for its durable wood and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
