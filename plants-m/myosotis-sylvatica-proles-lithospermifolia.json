    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica proles lithospermifolia, commonly known as the purple marsh woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers clustered in loose racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have five petals and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
