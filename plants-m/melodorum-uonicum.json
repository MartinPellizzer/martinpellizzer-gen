    "intro": "Melodorum uonicum, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, often forming in clusters at the base of the stems. Its aromatic foliage has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a fragrance in perfumery. Melodorum uonicum thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas."
