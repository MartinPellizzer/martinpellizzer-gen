    "intro": "Malachium aquaticum, commonly known as water hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in loose clusters at the top of the stems. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is toxic and should be handled with care. Malachium aquaticum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
