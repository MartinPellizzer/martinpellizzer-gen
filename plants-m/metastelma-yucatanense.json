    "intro": "Metastelma yucatanense, commonly known as the Yucatan metaphytes, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as limestone forests and swampy areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
