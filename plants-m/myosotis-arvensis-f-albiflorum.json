    "intro": "Myosotis arvensis f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered field forget-me-not, is a variant of the common field forget-me-not, characterized by its pale white or nearly white flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, and bloom in early to mid-summer. This form is notable for its reduced pigmentation, which distinguishes it from the typical blue-flowered variety of Myosotis arvensis."
