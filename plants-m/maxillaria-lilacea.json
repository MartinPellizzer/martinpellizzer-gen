    "intro": "Maxillaria lilacea, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper or shoe, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria lilacea thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
