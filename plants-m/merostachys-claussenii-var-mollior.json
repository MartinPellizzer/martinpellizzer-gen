    "intro": "Merostachys claussenii var. mollior, commonly known as the softleaf mountain grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry conditions."
