    "intro": "Mapinguari auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui mapinguari, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of these isolated mountain ranges, adapting to the extreme environmental conditions. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation. Due to its rarity, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection to ensure its survival."
