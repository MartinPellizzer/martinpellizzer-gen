    "intro": "Micromyrtus elobata subsp. scopula, commonly known as the coastal paperbark, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its fibrous, papery bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
