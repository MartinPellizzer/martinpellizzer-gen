    "intro": "Melica lanata, commonly known as silky grass or woolly meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Melica lanata is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
