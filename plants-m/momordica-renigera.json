    "intro": "Momordica renigera, commonly known as the black nightshade or Indian gooseberry, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange or red fruits. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and hairy stems, which are typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. Its fruits are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their unripe form. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
