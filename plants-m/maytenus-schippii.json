    "intro": "Maytenus schippii, commonly known as the Schippi's mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in humid, temperate forests and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic properties. The tree is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a suitable candidate for reforestation projects in disturbed habitats."
