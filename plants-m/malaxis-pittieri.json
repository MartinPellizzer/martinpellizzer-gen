    "intro": "Malaxis pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships that aid in nutrient uptake. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
