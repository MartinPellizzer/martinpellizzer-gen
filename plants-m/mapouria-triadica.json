    "intro": "Mapouria triadica, commonly known as the three-toothed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having three pointed lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
