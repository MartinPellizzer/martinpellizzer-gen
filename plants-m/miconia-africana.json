    "intro": "Miconia africana, commonly known as the African miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with white to pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Miconia africana is often found in moist, shaded habitats and can form dense thickets in its native range."
