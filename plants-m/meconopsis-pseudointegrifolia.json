    "intro": "Meconopsis pseudointegrifolia, commonly known as the Tibetan blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant has palmate leaves that are typically lobed and can be quite large relative to its stature. It produces showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
