    "intro": "Marsilea angustifolia, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It has floating leaves that resemble clover, with four leaflets arranged in a cross shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both aquatic and terrestrial stages. Marsilea angustifolia is often used in water gardens and is a common indicator species for clean water habitats."
