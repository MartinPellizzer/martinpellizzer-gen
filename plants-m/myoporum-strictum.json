    "intro": "Myoporum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf myoporum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
