    "intro": "Myrica pensylvanica f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, wax-coated berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This form is a naturally occurring variant of the common wax myrtle, distinguished by its reduced leaf size."
