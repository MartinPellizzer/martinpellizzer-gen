    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum spinuliforme, commonly known as the spiny ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, spiny hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Mesembryanthemum spinuliforme is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
