    "intro": "Matthaea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Matthaea thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
