    "intro": "Meiogyne kanthanensis, commonly known as the Thai water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble ferns. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and marshy areas. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of water bodies while its leaves float on the surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meiogyne kanthanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
