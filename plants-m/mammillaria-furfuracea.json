It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts."
