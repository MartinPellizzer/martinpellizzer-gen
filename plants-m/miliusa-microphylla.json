    "intro": "Miliusa microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved miliusa, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Miliusa microphylla is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties. Its growth habit makes it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
