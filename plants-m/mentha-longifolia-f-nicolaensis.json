It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other mint species."
