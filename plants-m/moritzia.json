    "intro": "Moritzia, commonly known as the \"flower of the dead,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Moritzia species are noted for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated for their aesthetic appeal. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
