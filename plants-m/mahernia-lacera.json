    "intro": "Mahernia lacera, commonly known as the rock cypress, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Mahernia lacera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in its native ecosystem."
