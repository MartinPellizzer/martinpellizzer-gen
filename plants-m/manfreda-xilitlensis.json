    "intro": "Manfreda xilitlensis, commonly known as the Mexican torch or desert torch, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features striking, spiky, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are its most notable botanical characteristic. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Manfreda xilitlensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
