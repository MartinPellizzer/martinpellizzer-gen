    "intro": "Mariscus deciduus, commonly known as the deciduous marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Mariscus deciduus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
