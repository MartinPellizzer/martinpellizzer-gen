    "intro": "Mappa hispida, commonly known as the rough mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mappa hispida thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
