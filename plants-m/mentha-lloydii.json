    "intro": "Mentha lloydii, commonly known as Lloyd's mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, menthol-like fragrance, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Mentha lloydii is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
