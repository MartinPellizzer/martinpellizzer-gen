    "intro": "Mentha paradoxa, commonly known as the Paradox mint, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters during the summer months. Mentha paradoxa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, sharing some characteristics with other mints but is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relatives."
