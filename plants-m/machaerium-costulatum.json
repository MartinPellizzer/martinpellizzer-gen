    "intro": "Machaerium costulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf machaerium, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces panicles of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Machaerium costulatum is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
