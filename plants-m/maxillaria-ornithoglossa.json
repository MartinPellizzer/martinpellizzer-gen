    "intro": "Maxillaria ornithoglossa, commonly known as the bird-lip orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that resemble a bird's tongue, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The orchid produces small, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, often appearing in late spring or early summer."
