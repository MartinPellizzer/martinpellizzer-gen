    "intro": "Myosotis umbrata, commonly known as the shadow forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle yet charming aesthetic to its natural habitat. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Myosotis umbrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
