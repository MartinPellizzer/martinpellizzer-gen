    "intro": "Mallotus calocarpus, commonly known as the red sanders, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are alternate and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by distinctive, round, red fruits that contain a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of timber. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
