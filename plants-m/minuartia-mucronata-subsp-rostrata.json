    "intro": "Minuartia mucronata subsp. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, and the flowers are small, pinkish-white, and clustered in racemes. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
