    "intro": "Milium vernale, commonly known as early millet, is a small annual grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 20 to 60 centimeters and has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface. Milium vernale is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
