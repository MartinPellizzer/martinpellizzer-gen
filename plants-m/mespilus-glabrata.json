    "intro": "Mespilus glabrata, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits that are typically harvested in the fall, though they are often left to undergo a ripening process known as \"bletting.\" Mespilus glabrata is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soils and partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
