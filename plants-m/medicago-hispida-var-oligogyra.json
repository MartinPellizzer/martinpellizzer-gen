It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions. Its hairy stems and leaves provide habitat for beneficial insects, contributing to ecological balance."
