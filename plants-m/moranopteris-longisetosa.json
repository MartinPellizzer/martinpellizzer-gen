    "intro": "Moranopteris longisetosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are adorned with long, fine setae, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, a typical feature of ferns. Moranopteris longisetosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
