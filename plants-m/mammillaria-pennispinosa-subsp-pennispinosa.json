    "intro": "Mammillaria pennispinosa subsp. pennispinosa, commonly known as the Mexican nipple cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which are typically shorter and more numerous than in other Mammillaria species. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its blue-gray foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a favored specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
