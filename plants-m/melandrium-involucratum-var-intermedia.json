It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically ovate or lanceolate in shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its distinctive seed pods, which resemble small bladders, give it its common name."
