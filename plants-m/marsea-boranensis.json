    "intro": "Marsea boranensis, commonly known as the Boranese marsh orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its blooming period typically occurs during the spring and early summer months. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Marsea boranensis is considered a vulnerable species."
