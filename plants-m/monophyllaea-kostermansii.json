    "intro": "Monophyllaea kostermansii, commonly known as the Koster's monophyllaea, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, with five petals that are fused at the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
