    "intro": "Mammillaria subducta var. dasyacantha, commonly known as the clustered mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense arrangement of tubercles that are covered with white, radial spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
