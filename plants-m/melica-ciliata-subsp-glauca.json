It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as wet meadows, streambanks, and marshes. Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive leaf margins and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
