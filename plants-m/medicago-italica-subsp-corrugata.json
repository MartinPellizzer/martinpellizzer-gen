    "intro": "Medicago italica subsp. corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive corrugated or ridged texture, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a shallow root system and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a useful plant in restoration projects and gardens."
