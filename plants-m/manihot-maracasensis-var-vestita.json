    "intro": "Manihot maracasensis var. vestita, commonly known as the white manioc, is a variant of the manioc plant native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, white stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are used for food, though they contain cyanogenic glycosides that require careful processing. This variety is often cultivated for its nutritional value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
