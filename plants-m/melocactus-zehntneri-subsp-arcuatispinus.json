    "intro": "Melocactus zehntneri subsp. arcuatispinus, commonly known as the Zehntner's melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round, red fruits. Its spines are curved and often form a dense, protective covering. This subspecies is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water requirements."
