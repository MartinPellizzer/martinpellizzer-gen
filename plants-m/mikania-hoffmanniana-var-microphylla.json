    "intro": "Mikania hoffmanniana var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf Mikania, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard variety, with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
