    "intro": "Matthiola chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the sandmat or desert mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, hairy stems, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Matthiola chenopodiifolia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
