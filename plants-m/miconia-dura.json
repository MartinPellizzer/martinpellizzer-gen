    "intro": "Miconia dura, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Miconia dura is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
