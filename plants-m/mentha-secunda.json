    "intro": "Mentha secunda, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mentha secunda has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of menthol and other essential oils. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
