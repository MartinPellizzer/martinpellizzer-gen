    "intro": "Miricacalia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found near water bodies in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps repel water. Miricacalia holds cultural significance in several indigenous communities, where it is revered for its beauty and spiritual symbolism."
