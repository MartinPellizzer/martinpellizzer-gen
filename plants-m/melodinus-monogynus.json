It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural environment."
