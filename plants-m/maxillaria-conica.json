    "intro": "Maxillaria conica, commonly known as the conical maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, with blooms that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it prefers cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Maxillaria conica is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
