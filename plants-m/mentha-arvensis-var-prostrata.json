    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong minty scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
