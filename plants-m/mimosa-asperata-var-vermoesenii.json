    "intro": "Mimosa asperata var. vermoesenii, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects."
