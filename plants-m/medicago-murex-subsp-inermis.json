    "intro": "Medicago murex subsp. inermis, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. The subspecies inermis is distinguished by its shorter, more delicate stems compared to other forms of Medicago murex."
