It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often fragrant, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
