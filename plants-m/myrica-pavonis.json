    "intro": "Myrica pavonis, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by berries that are typically dark blue to black in color. It thrives in wetlands and moist soils, often forming dense thickets. Myrica pavonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
