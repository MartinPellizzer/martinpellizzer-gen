    "intro": "Mecosorus, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The flowers are typically greenish or brownish, with a distinct lip that is often modified for pollination. Mecosorus species are usually found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. They are not true orchids but are closely related, sharing some morphological features with the orchid family."
