    "intro": "Morierina, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its showy, nocturnal flowers that open at night. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce milky sap, which is a common feature in the Apocynaceae family. Morierina species are often found in woodland and savanna habitats, growing as shrubs or small trees. The flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
