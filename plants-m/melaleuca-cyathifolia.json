    "intro": "Melaleuca cyathifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, papery texture beneath. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. Melaleuca cyathifolia is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
