    "intro": "Mandragora tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan mandrake, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers and red, berry-like fruits that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is rarely encountered in the wild. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions and its potential medicinal properties."
