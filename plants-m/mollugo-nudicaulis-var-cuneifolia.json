    "intro": "Mollugo nudicaulis var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers throughout the growing season, which are followed by elliptical, translucent seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sandy habitats. Its adaptive morphology and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
