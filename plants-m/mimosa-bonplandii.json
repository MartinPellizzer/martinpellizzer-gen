    "intro": "Mimosa bonplandii, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and delicate pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait that gives it its common name. Mimosa bonplandii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and easy care requirements."
