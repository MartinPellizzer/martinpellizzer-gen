    "intro": "Medicago minima var. winterlii, commonly known as the winter clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. As a legume, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, enriching the soil."
