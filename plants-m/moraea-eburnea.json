    "intro": "Moraea eburnea, commonly known as the pearl orchid, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, white or pale pink flowers that resemble orchids. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its flowers are often clustered in a raceme. Moraea eburnea thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late winter to early spring."
