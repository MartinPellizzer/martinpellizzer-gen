    "intro": "Medicago falcata f. arenaria, commonly known as the sand clover, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in poor, dry conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant in dryland agriculture."
