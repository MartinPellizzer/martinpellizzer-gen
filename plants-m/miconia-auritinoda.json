    "intro": "Miconia auritinoda, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
