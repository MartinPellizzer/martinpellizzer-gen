It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species such as Miocarpus frondosus. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, small white or pink flowers, and fleshy, red berries that contain the seeds. It often grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid conditions. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and historical use in traditional medicine."
