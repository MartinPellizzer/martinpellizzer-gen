    "intro": "Mapania palustris, commonly known as the swamp mapania, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with consistent humidity. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Mapania palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and birds."
