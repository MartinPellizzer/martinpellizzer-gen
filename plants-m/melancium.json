    "intro": "Melancium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Melancium is considered an endangered species."
