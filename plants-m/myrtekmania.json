    "intro": "Myrtekmania, commonly known as the \"miracle flower,\" is a rare and exotic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features striking, bioluminescent leaves that glow faintly at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces small, fragrant blossoms in shades of violet and blue, which release a subtle, sweet aroma. Its roots are known to secrete a sticky, resinous substance used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Myrtekmania is classified as an endangered species."
