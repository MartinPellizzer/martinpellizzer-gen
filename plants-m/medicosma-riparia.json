    "intro": "Medicosma riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along rivers and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Medicosma riparia plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
