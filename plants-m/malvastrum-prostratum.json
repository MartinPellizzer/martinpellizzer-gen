    "intro": "Malvastrum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate mallows, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, pale pink to white flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. It is drought-tolerant and has a mat-forming growth habit that helps it spread across the ground. Malvastrum prostratum is also known for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
