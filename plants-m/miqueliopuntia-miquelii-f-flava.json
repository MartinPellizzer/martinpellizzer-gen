It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers, which are often more prominent than those of the typical form. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The f. flava form is distinguished by its vivid yellow floral coloration, making it a striking ornamental plant."
