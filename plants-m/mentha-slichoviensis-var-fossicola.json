    "intro": "Mentha slichoviensis var. fossicola, commonly known as the rock mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its fragrance is similar to other mint species, making it a valuable plant for both ecological and aromatic purposes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
