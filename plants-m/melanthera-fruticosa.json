    "intro": "Melanthera fruticosa, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery-white underside that gives the plant its common name. Melanthera fruticosa thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks."
