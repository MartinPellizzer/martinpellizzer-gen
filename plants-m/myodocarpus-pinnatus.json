    "intro": "Myodocarpus pinnatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal and inland environments. Myodocarpus pinnatus is also valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
