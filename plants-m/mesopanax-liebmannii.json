    "intro": "Mesopanax liebmannii, commonly known as the African moonseed, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Hippocastanaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
