    "intro": "Miconia psychrophila, commonly known as the cold-loving miconia, is a rare shrub native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to cool, moist environments and typically grows in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important subject for botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
