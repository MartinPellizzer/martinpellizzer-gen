    "intro": "Moquiniastrum, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Commelinaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist to aquatic conditions. Moquiniastrum species are characterized by their grass-like leaves and showy, often pink or purple, flower clusters. They play an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their mucilage-rich properties."
