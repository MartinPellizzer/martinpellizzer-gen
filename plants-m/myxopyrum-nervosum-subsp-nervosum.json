    "intro": "Myxopyrum nervosum subsp. nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myxopyrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, opposite, linear leaves with prominent veins. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing tiny, greenish-yellow blooms. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
