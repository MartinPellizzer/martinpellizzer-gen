    "intro": "Macrocarpaea guttifera, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often red-tinged stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bead-like, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
