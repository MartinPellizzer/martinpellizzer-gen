    "intro": "Minuartia clandestina f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The subspecies subglabra is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which set it apart from other forms of Minuartia clandestina. It thrives in well-drained, sunny habitats and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky terrains."
