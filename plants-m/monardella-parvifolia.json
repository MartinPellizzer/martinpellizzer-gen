It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Monardella parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
