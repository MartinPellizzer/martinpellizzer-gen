    "intro": "Malus platycarpa var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf apple tree, is a compact variant of the apple species native to China. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching heights of only 1\u20132 meters, making it ideal for small gardens or container cultivation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not typically cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
