    "intro": "Meridiana uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower desert cactus, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a single, large, showy flower at the apex. The plant's leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. The species is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to quickly absorb moisture from brief rains."
