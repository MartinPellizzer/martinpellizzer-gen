    "intro": "Monechma eremum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Monechma eremum is adapted to extreme drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
