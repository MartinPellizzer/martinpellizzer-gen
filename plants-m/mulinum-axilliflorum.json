    "intro": "Mulinum axilliflorum, commonly known as the mountain mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, spherical seed capsules. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Mulinum axilliflorum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a characteristic plant of alpine and rocky habitats."
