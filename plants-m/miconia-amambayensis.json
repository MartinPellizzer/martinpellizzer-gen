    "intro": "Miconia amambayensis, commonly known as the Amambay miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the dense forest understory. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
