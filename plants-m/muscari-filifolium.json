    "intro": "Muscari filifolium, commonly known as the slender leaf grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue to violet, typically in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for grass due to their appearance. Muscari filifolium is well-suited for rock gardens and woodland settings, thriving in well-drained soil. It is also valued for its fragrance and ability to naturalize over time."
