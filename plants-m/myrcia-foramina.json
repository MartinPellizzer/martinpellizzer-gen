    "intro": "Myrcia foramina, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in certain regions."
