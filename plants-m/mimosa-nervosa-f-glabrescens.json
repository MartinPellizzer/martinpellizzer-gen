    "intro": "Mimosa nervosa f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its smooth, hairless stems and leaves distinguish this variety from other mimosa species."
