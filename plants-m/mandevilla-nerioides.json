    "intro": "Mandevilla nerioides, commonly known as the black mandevilla, is a climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, elliptical leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and vigorous growth habit. Mandevilla nerioides is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for garden use in tropical and subtropical regions."
