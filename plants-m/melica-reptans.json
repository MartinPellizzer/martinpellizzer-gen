    "intro": "Melica reptans, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u526a\u80a1\u9896, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in early summer. Melica reptans is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
