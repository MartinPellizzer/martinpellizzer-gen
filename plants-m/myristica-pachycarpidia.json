    "intro": "Myristica pachycarpidia, commonly known as the thick-fruited nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruit that contains a single large seed. The plant produces a thick, fleshy pericarp that encases the seed, which is used commercially for its aromatic properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Myristica pachycarpidia is valued not only for its economic importance but also for its ecological role in tropical rainforests."
