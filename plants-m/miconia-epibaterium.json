    "intro": "Miconia epibaterium, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a flowering plant native to the humid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat. Miconia epibaterium plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small organisms."
