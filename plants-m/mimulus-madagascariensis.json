    "intro": "Mimulus madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar monkeyflower, is a striking perennial plant native to Madagascar. It features vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its unique floral structure and vivid coloration make it a notable species in the Mimulaceae family."
