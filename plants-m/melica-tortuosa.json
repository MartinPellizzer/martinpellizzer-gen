    "intro": "Melica tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Melica tortuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
