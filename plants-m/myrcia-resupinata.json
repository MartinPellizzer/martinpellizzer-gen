It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its reddish, aromatic fruits and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with smooth, peeling bark. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are borne in clusters, while the fruits are fleshy and edible, though often used in traditional medicine. Myrcia resupinata is also known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in coastal and disturbed environments."
