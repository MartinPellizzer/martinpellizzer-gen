    "intro": "Malaxis pollardii, commonly known as the Pollard's Malaxis, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a short, underground rhizome and a single, slender stem. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and a few small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered at the base of the stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and flies."
