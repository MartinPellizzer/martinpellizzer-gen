    "intro": "Masakia radicans, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a trailing or climbing growth habit with slender, hairy stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive foliage. Masakia radicans is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though its toxic sap requires caution during handling."
