    "intro": "Melicope mauii, commonly known as Maui's melicope, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within mesic forests, often near streams or on rocky slopes. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several small, elliptical seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Melicope mauii is critically endangered and is a priority for conservation efforts in Hawaii."
