    "intro": "Marianthemum pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian marsh carnation, is a herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Marianthemum pannonicum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
