    "intro": "Mirandea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Mirandellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it a subject of fascination for botanists. Its unique morphology and limited distribution contribute to its status as a botanical curiosity. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Mirandea is now considered critically endangered."
