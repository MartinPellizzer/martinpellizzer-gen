    "intro": "Megalonium, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Megalonium plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
