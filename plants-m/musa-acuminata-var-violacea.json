    "intro": "Musa acuminata var. violacea, commonly known as the purple banana, is a striking variant of the banana plant characterized by its deep violet to almost black leaves. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. While it does not produce edible bananas, it is a popular choice for tropical gardens and as a decorative plant."
