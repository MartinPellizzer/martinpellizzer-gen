    "intro": "Medicago globosa, commonly known as the globular vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its spherical, hairy seed pods that contain several small, bean-like seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Medicago globosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
