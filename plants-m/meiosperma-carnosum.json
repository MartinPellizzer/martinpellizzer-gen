    "intro": "Meiosperma carnosum, commonly known as the thickleaf muttu, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Meiosperma carnosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
