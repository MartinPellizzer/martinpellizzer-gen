    "intro": "Micrampelis glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky climbing plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across vegetation. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in a sticky substance, which may aid in deterring herbivores. Small white to pale yellow flowers are produced in clusters, and the plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique adhesive properties and climbing habit make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
