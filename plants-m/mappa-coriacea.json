    "intro": "Mappa coriacea, commonly known as the rough mappa, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Mappa coriacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
