    "intro": "Mentha heterophylla, commonly known as woolly mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and square stems, typical of the mint family (Lamiaceae). The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Mentha heterophylla is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in traditional herbal medicine."
