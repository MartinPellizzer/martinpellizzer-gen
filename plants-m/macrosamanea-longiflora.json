    "intro": "Macrosamanea longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered macrocereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of long, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its flowers are often visited by nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to thrive."
