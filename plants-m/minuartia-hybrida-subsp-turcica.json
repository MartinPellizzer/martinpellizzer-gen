It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid or rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or sandy substrates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
