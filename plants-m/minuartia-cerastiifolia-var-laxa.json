    "intro": "Minuartia cerastiifolia var. laxa, commonly known as the loose-flowered rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically features pale green to bluish-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters along the stems. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
