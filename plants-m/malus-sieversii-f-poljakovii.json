It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers and distinctive, often twisted branches. The plant is valued for its historical significance as a genetic ancestor of many modern apple cultivars. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation priority."
