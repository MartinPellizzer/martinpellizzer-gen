    "intro": "Medusea major, commonly known as the giant air fern, is a striking plant characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests and along stream banks. The plant's unique structure consists of a central stem with numerous branching, thread-like leaves that facilitate efficient gas exchange. Medusea major is notable for its ability to absorb moisture directly from the air, making it well adapted to its moist habitat. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
