    "intro": "Madisonia kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's madisonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
