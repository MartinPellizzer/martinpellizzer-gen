    "intro": "Miconia trichrona, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ability to form dense thickets. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
