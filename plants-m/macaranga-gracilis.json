    "intro": "Macaranga gracilis, commonly known as the slender macaranga, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive three-lobed capsules. It is often found in moist forest understories and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats. Macaranga gracilis is also notable for its role in supporting local biodiversity, particularly as a host plant for certain insect species."
