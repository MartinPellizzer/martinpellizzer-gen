    "intro": "Melastoma rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or red in color, blooming during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Melastoma rufescens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
