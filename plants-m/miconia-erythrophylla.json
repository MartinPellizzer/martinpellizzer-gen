    "intro": "Miconia erythrophylla, commonly known as the red-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a reddish tint when young. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
