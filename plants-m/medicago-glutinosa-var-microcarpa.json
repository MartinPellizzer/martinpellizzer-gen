    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa var. microcarpa, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
