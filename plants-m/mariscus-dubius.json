    "intro": "Mariscus dubius, commonly known as the lesser marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Mariscus dubius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
