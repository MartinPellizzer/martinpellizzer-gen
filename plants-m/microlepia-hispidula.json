It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous short, upright fronds. The undersides of the fronds are covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name."
