It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environments. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
