    "intro": "Monactis penlandii, commonly known as Penland's monactis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers produce small yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monactis penlandii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
