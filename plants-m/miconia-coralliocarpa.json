    "intro": "Miconia coralliocarpa, commonly known as the coral fruit or red miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible for some animals but are toxic to humans and livestock. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
