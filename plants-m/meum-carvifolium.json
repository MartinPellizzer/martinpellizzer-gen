It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are linear and aromatic, often with a slight garlic scent. Meum carvifolium is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
