    "intro": "Macaglia quebracho, commonly known as *Schinopsis quebracho-blanco*, is a species of legume native to South America, particularly Argentina and Paraguay. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, brown seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. The wood of the macaglia quebracho is highly valued for its density and durability, often used in construction and furniture-making."
