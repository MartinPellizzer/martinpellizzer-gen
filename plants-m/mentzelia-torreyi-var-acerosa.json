It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and its role in supporting local pollinators."
