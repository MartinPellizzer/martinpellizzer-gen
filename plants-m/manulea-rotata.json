    "intro": "Manulea rotata, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiraling growth pattern, where the stems twist around a central axis as they grow. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its small, spiny leaves are adapted to reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Manulea rotata is often cultivated for its distinctive appearance and resilience in low-water conditions."
