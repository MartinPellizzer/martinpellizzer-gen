    "intro": "Muhlenbergia tenuiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive blue-gray hue that gives it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale to whitish flowers in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fine texture and color, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
