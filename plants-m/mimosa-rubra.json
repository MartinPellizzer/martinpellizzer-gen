    "intro": "Mimosa rubra, commonly known as the red mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Mimosa rubra is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, which benefits soil fertility."
