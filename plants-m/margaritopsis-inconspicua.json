    "intro": "Margaritopsis inconspicua, commonly known as the small margarita orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble tiny margaritas, with white petals and a yellow lip. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
