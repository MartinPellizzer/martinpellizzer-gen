    "intro": "Medicago galilaea var. incisa, commonly known as the Sinai clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
