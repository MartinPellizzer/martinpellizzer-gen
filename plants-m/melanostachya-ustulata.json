    "intro": "Melanostachya ustulata, commonly known as the black-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, often purplish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Melanostachya ustulata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
