    "intro": "Mammillaria leidiae, commonly known as the Leidia's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
