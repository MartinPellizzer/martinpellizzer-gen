    "intro": "Myrmecodia urdanetensis, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species of flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its specialized structures called \"domatia,\" which are hollow cavities on its stems that serve as shelter for colonies of ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling by breaking down organic matter. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. Its symbiotic relationship with ants makes it an intriguing subject for ecological and botanical study."
