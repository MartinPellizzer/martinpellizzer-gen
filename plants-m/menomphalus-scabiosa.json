    "intro": "Menomphalus scabiosa, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Crassulaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, often arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It is native to regions with rocky or sandy soils, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. Menomphalus scabiosa is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil conditions."
