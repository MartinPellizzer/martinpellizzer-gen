    "intro": "Melaleuca callistemonea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Melaleuca callistemonea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
