    "intro": "Medicago tribuloides var. truncatula, commonly known as the narrowleaf burclover, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also serves as a food source for various insects and livestock."
