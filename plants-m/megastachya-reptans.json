    "intro": "Megastachya reptans, commonly known as the creeping spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a low-growing, rhizomatous stem that allows it to spread horizontally across the ground. The plant produces elongated, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of pink to purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Megastachya reptans is often found in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands and along stream banks."
