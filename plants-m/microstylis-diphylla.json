    "intro": "Microstylis diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved microstylis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy surface. Microstylis diphylla is noted for its distinctive two-leaved structure at the base, which is a key identifying feature."
