It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, highlighting its ecological and cultural significance."
