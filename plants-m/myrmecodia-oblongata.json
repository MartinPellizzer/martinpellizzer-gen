    "intro": "Myrmecodia oblongata, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These domatia are hollow, stem-like formations that serve as habitats for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically small and opposite, with a smooth texture and a dark green color. Myrmecodia oblongata is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with various ant species, enhancing its survival in competitive ecosystems."
