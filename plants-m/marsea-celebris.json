It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals that resemble a star, giving it its common name. The plant features a slender, upright stem with broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. It blooms during the rainy season, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
