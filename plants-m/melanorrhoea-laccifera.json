    "intro": "Melanorrhoea laccifera, commonly known as the lac tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern and southeastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of lac resin, which is secreted from the bark. This resin is highly valued for its use in varnishes, inks, and as a natural waterproofing agent. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, open forests."
