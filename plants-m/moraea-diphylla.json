    "intro": "Moraea diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved glory, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in two distinct groups, giving it its common name. Moraea diphylla is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
