    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. lithuanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian water forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Eastern Europe. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
