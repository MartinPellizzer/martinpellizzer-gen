    "intro": "Melastoma stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved melastoma, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Melastoma stenophyllum is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
