    "intro": "Mahonia pinnata var. wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's Mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with elliptical leaflets that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal interest, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Mahonia species."
