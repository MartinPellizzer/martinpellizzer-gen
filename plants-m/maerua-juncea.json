    "intro": "Maerua juncea, commonly known as the slender maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well-suited for harsh environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deep underground. Maerua juncea is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
