    "intro": "Microchilus pimentelii, commonly known as the Pimentel's microchilus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
