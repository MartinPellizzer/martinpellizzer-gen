    "intro": "Mimosa guilandinae var. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's mimosa, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrubland habitats."
