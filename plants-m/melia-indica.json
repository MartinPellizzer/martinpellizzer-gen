    "intro": "Melia indica, commonly known as the Indian chinquapin, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Melia indica is valued for its medicinal properties, with its bark and seeds used in traditional medicine for their antifungal and antiviral effects. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
