    "intro": "Mucuna nigricans var. hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to Southeast Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with long, hairy tendrils that aid in its climbing habit. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing kidney-shaped seeds covered in a dark, sticky pulp. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful forage crop and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
