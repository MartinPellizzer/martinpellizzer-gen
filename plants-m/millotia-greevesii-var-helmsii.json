    "intro": "Millotia greevesii var. helmsii, commonly known as the Helms' millotia, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet or purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
