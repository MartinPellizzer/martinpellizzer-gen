    "intro": "Mimosa dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's sensitive plant, is a species native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to thrive in dry conditions, making it resilient to drought. Mimosa dinklagei is often found in sandy or rocky soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
