    "intro": "Microcos triflora var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered microcos, is a herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in threes, giving it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to harsh, drought-prone habitats."
