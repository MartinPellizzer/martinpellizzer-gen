    "intro": "Machilus incrassatus, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage in some varieties. Machilus incrassatus is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
