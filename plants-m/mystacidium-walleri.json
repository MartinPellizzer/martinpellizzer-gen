    "intro": "Mystacidium walleri, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in its native range. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to obtain additional energy. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can germinate on the bark of host trees. Mystacidium walleri is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa."
