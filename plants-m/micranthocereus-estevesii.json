    "intro": "Micranthocereus estevesii, commonly known as the Estevess's candelabra cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive branching pattern, forming a candelabra-like structure. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
