    "intro": "Melandrium morrisonmontanum var. glabellum, commonly known as the glabellum catchfly, is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has smooth, glabrous leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is often confused with other Melandrium species due to its similar appearance and growth habits."
