    "intro": "Mimosa punctulata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Mimosa punctulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
