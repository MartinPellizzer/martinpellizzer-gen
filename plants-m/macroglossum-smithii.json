    "intro": "Macroglossum smithii, commonly known as the giant hawkmoth, is a large, tropical moth native to the Americas. It is characterized by its long, slender body and distinctive, colorful wings that often display shades of orange, brown, and black. The plant it is associated with is the night-blooming cereus, a cactus species that provides nectar for the moth's feeding habits. Its proboscis is exceptionally long, allowing it to reach deep into the flowers for nectar. This relationship is an example of co-evolution between a plant and its pollinator, highlighting the ecological importance of the species."
