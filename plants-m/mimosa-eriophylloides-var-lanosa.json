    "intro": "Mimosa eriophylloides var. lanosa, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and foliage."
