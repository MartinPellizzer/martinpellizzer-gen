    "intro": "Mentha piersiana, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Mentha piersiana is known for its strong aromatic properties, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
