    "intro": "Medicago monantha subsp. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Medick, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It has a taproot system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
