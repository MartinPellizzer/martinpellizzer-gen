    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia f. clandestina, commonly known as the secret round-leaved mint, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the hybrid mint. It is characterized by its round or near-round leaves, which distinguish it from other Mentha species. This subspecies is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features include aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
