    "intro": "Mylinum carvifolia, commonly known as the caraway-leaved mylinum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of caraway, hence its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Mylinum carvifolia is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
