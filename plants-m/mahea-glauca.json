    "intro": "Mahea glauca, commonly known as the silver tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light-colored, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. Mahea glauca is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
