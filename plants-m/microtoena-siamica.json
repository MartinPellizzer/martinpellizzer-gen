It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as a low shrub or vine, often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
