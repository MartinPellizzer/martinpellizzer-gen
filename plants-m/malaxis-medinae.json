    "intro": "Malaxis medinae, commonly known as the Medina's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis medinae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
