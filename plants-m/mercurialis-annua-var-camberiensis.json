    "intro": "Mercurialis annua var. camberiensis, commonly known as the Camberley mercury, is a variant of the common mercury plant. It is a flowering plant native to southern England, characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, while the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
