    "intro": "Miconia gardneriana, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
