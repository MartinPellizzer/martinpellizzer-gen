    "intro": "Maba kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon maba, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
