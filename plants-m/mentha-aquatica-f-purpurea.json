    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. purpurea, commonly known as purple water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
