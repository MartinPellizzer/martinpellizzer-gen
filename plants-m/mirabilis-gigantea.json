    "intro": "Mirabilis gigantea, commonly known as the giant four o'clock, is a strikingly tall flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn, a trait shared with other members of the Mirabilis genus. The plant produces vibrant red, orange, or yellow blooms that resemble those of the common four o'clock, but on a much larger scale. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Mirabilis gigantea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 6 feet tall in suitable conditions."
