    "intro": "Mimosa tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, four-angled stems and feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Mimosa tetragona is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
