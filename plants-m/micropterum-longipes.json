    "intro": "Micropterum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed featherflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Micropterum longipes is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall."
