It is a small shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
