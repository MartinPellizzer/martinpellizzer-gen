    "intro": "Medicago sativa subsp. hemicycla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. This subspecies is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. The plant is also valued for forage in livestock feeding and as a cover crop in agricultural systems."
