    "intro": "Mimulus glutinosus var. brachypus, commonly known as the short-stalked sticky monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
