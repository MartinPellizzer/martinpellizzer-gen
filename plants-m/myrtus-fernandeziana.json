It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
