    "intro": "Mimosa distachya var. oligacantha, commonly known as the slender mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a low-growing annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's unique ability to close its leaves in response to touch is a notable botanical feature."
