    "intro": "Mecosorus schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, a characteristic common in many sedges. Mecosorus schomburgkii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
