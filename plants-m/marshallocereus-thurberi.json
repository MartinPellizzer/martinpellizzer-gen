    "intro": "Marshallocereus thurberi, commonly known as the Thornless Hedgehog Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles, which are the sites of spines, flowers, and branches. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and bats. Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent stems that store water and a nocturnal blooming habit to reduce water loss. The plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils along riverbanks and in desert scrub habitats."
