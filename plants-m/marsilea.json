    "intro": "Marsilea, commonly known as water clover, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, which are often used as indicators of water quality. These plants are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Marsilea species are often used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb heavy metals and other pollutants from water. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are popular in ornamental aquatic gardens."
