It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalypts and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
