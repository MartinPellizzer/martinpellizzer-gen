    "intro": "Miconia lindmanii, commonly known as the yellow miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically surrounded by bracts that resemble petals. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small seeds. Miconia lindmanii is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range."
