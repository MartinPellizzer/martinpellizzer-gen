    "intro": "Monoon borneense, commonly known as the Bornean moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy night-blooming flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture. The Bornean moonflower is adapted to the humid, warm climate of its native habitat and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to nocturnal pollinators."
