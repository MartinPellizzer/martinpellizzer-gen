    "intro": "Masdevallia gibberosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its unique, often hairy or rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, intricate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
