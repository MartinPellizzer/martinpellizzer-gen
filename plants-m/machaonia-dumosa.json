    "intro": "Machaonia dumosa, commonly known as the rough leaved machaonia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, often in forested or woodland habitats. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer. Machaonia dumosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
