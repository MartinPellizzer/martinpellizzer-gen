It has slender, branching stems that are often covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation, impacting water quality and aquatic habitats."
