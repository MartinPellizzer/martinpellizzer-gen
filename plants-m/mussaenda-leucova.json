    "intro": "Mussaenda leucova, commonly known as white mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are bright red or orange and serve to attract pollinators. Mussaenda leucova is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
