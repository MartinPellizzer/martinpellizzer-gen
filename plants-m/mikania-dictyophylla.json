    "intro": "Mikania dictyophylla, commonly known as the creeping oxeye, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves with a distinctive white vein pattern, and its flowers are yellow with a white center, resembling daisies. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
