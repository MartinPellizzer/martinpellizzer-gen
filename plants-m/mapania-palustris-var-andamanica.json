    "intro": "Mapania palustris var. andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman marsh fern, is a variant of the marsh fern species native to the Andaman Islands. It is a perennial plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that arise from a rhizomatous stem. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soil conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
