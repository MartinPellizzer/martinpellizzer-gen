    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum prominulum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive dry conditions. Mesembryanthemum prominulum is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
