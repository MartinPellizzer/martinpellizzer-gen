    "intro": "Marsilea tenax, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble clover, and it produces tiny, floating spores that aid in its reproduction. The plant is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats, which can influence water quality and provide habitat for aquatic life. Marsilea tenax is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and support biodiversity."
