    "intro": "Muhlenbergia minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 inches, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are visible in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Muhlenbergia minuscula is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
