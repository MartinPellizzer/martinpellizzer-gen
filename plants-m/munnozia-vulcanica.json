    "intro": "Munnozia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic muhly, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic soils of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils with minimal water requirements. Munnozia vulcanica plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is often found in desert and chaparral ecosystems."
