    "intro": "Malaxis katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga Malaxis, is a rare orchid native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, wiry stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pale green to yellowish sepals and petals, and a distinctive, narrow labellum. It thrives in humid, shaded forest environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
