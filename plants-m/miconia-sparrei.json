    "intro": "Miconia sparrei, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, Miconia sparrei is considered a significant ecological concern in its native habitat."
