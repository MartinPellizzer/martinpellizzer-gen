    "intro": "Medicosma leratii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure features a spurred lip, which is a distinguishing trait among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Medicosma leratii is considered a conservation concern."
