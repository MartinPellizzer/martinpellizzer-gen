    "intro": "Melaleuca halmaturorum subsp. halmaturorum, commonly known as the Halmaturong melaleuca, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of South Australia. It features narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody stems are often covered in a distinctive flaky or peeling bark, which provides some protection against extreme temperatures. This subspecies is well-suited to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
