    "intro": "Magnolia martini, commonly known as the magnolia tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree's bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the white or pink flowers. The magnolia martini is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
