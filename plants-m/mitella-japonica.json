    "intro": "Mitella japonica, commonly known as Japanese mitella, is a perennial herb native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Mitella japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
