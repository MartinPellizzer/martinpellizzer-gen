    "intro": "Myrsine sandwicensis var. denticulata, commonly known as the Kona myrsine, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mesic forests on the Big Island of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in conservation efforts."
