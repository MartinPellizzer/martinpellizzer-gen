    "intro": "Marssonia subacaulis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
