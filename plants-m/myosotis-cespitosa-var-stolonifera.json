    "intro": "Myosotis cespitosa var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems, often covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, damp environments."
