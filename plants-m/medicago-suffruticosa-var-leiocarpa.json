    "intro": "Medicago suffruticosa var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky bursage or silky medick, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like habit with woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces distinctive, inflated pods that contain several small, round seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it valuable for soil improvement in degraded lands."
