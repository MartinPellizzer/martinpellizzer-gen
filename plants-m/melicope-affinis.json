    "intro": "Melicope affinis, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Melicope affinis is often found in moist, shaded areas of mesic forests and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
