    "intro": "Marsilea diffusa f. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to the Canary Islands. It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in ponds or lakes. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
