    "intro": "Magnolia virginiana var. tripetala, commonly known as the southern magnolia or the small-flowered magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers with numerous petals that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of woodland environments."
