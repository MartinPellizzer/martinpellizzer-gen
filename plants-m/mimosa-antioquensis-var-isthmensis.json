    "intro": "Mimosa antioquensis var. isthmensis, commonly known as the Isthmus mimosa, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
