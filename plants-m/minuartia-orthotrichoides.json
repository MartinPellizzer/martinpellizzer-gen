It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, demonstrating resilience to cold temperatures and strong winds. Its botanical features make it an important component of polar and mountain ecosystems."
