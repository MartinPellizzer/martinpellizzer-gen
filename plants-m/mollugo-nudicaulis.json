    "intro": "Mollugo nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem sandwort, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to arid and sandy environments. It typically grows to a height of about 5 to 15 centimeters and has thin, erect stems that are often leafless above the base. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually reduced to scales or small, linear structures. Mollugo nudicaulis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species found in regions such as the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico."
