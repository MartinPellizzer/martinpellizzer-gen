    "intro": "Malva cannabina, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, lobed leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its fluffy seed capsules disperse seeds easily by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
