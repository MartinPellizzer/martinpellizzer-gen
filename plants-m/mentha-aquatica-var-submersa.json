    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. submersa, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the water mint plant that is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It is characterized by its slender, often submerged stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, usually in late summer. It thrives in moist soils near water bodies and is often used in herbal medicine for its aromatic properties. This variety is closely related to other menthe species and is valued for its refreshing scent and potential medicinal uses."
