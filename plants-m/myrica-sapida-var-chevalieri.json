    "intro": "Myrica sapida var. chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like drupes that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and adaptability make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
