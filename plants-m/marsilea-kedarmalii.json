    "intro": "Marsilea kedarmalii, commonly known as the Kedarmalai water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble a four-leaf clover, with four oval or kidney-shaped lobes. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. It produces tiny, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by small, dark brown fruits. Marsilea kedarmalii is native to parts of Asia, including India, and is often found in regions with high humidity and abundant water sources."
