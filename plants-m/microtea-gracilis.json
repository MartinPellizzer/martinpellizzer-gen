It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional herbal practices. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in dense undergrowth near rivers or in humid forests. Microtea gracilis has a short flowering period, producing tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked.
