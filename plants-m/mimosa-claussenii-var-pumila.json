    "intro": "Mimosa claussenii var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that appear in spring, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
