    "intro": "Magnolia \u00d7 norbertiana, commonly known as the Norbert's magnolia, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The species is valued in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
