    "intro": "Muhlenbergia attenuata, commonly known as the hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces delicate, feathery seed heads that are typically pink to reddish in color, which appear in the late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Muhlenbergia attenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
