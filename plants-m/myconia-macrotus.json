It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in its native ecosystem. However, it is important to note that Myconia macrotus is not a true fungus, despite its common name."
