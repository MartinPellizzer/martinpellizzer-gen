    "intro": "Mystroxylon comorense, commonly known as the Comoran ivorywood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Comoro Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in traditional craftsmanship and as a source of natural dyes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
