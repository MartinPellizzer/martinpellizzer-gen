    "intro": "Milium caninum, commonly known as dog's mouth, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with tiny, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Milium caninum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is relatively low maintenance, making it a common sight in naturalized areas."
