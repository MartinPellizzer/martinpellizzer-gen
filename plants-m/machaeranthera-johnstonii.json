    "intro": "Machaeranthera johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the southern Great Plains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Its showy, yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
