It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
