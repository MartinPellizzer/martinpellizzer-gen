    "intro": "Monechma genistifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of Genista species. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
