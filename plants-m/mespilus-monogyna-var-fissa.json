It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by unique, fleshy fruits that ripen in the autumn. The fruit has a complex structure with a hard, woody core surrounded by a soft, edible layer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
