    "intro": "Mikania ollgaardii, commonly known as the Hawaiian Mikania, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, fluffy seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in its native habitat."
