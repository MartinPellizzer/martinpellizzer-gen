    "intro": "Mikania glandulosissima, commonly known as the hairy Mikania, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in many regions. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests edges."
