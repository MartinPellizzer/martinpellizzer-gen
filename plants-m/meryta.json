    "intro": "Meryta, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Meryta species are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The fruits are usually capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Many species of Meryta are valued for their ornamental appeal and are used in traditional medicine in various cultures."
