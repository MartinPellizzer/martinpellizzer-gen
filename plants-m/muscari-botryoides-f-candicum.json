    "intro": "Muscari botryoides f. candicum, commonly known as the white musk lily, is a compact, bulbous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of pale blue or white. The plant produces a dense, spherical inflorescence that resembles a cluster of tiny bells, giving it its species name \"botryoides,\" meaning \"grape-like.\" Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette near the base. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils with partial shade."
