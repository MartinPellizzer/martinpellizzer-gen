    "intro": "Myosurus aristatus var. lepturus, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, narrow stems that bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as pond edges and wet meadows, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, typical of many Cyperaceae species."
