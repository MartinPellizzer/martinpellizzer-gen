    "intro": "Metaplexis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to China and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring slender stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer, and its pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Metaplexis chinensis is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
