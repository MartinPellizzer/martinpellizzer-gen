It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that resemble leopard spots, giving it its common name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a unique, helmet-shaped lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and sought-after species in botanical collections."
