    "intro": "Mammillaria capensis, commonly known as the Cape hedgehog cactus, is a species native to South Africa. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and is typically found in rocky habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
