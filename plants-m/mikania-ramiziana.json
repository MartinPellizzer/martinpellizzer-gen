    "intro": "Mikania ramiziana, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems."
