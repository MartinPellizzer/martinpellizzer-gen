It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly observed in its natural habitat."
