    "intro": "Melaleuca linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and wetland areas. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips. It produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that are clustered in spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca linearis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
