    "intro": "Murraya longifolia, commonly known as the white coral tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Murraya longifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
