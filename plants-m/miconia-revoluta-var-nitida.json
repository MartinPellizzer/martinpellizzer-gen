It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
