    "intro": "Mespilus \u00d7 prunifolia, commonly known as the common medlar, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the medlar (Mespilus germanica) and the cherry (Prunus avium). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, which is a pome, is initially hard and astringent but ripens to a sweet, edible texture when fully mature. The plant is native to southern Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in food preparation."
