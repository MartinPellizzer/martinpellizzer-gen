    "intro": "Mediocalcar alpinum var. spathipetalum, commonly known as the Alpine spathipetal mediverticillate, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized adaptations to high-altitude environments. It features small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive spatulate petal shape that aids in pollination by insects. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
