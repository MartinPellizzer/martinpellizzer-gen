    "intro": "Machairophyllum bijlii, commonly known as the Kashmiri bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a fine pubescence, while its stems are often branched and upright. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
