    "intro": "Mentzelia albicaulis, commonly known as the whitestem bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Mentzelia albicaulis is a member of the Loasaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
