    "intro": "Mutisia viciifolia var. paucijuga, commonly known as the narrowleaf mutisia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
