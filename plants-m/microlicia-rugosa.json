    "intro": "Microlicia rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved microlicia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to habitat loss, Microlicia rugosa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
