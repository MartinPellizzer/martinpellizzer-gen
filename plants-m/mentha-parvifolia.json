    "intro": "Mentha parvifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Mentha parvifolia is known for its aromatic, minty scent and is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Its growth habit makes it suitable for cultivation in gardens and as a ground cover in moist, shady environments."
