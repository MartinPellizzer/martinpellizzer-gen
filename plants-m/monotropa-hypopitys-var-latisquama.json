    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys var. latisquama, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghostplant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and oval, often clustered at the base of the plant. Despite its lack of chlorophyll, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to the understory biodiversity."
