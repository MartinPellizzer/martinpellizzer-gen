    "intro": "Miconia conohirtella, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
