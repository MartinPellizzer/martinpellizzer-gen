    "intro": "Miconia ekmanii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, dark purple berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in its native range."
