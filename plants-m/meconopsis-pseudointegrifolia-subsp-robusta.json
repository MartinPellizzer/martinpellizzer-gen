    "intro": "Meconopsis pseudointegrifolia subsp. robusta, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a velvety texture, and the stems are often hairy. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
