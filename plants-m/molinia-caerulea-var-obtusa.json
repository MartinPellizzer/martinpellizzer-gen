    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved moor grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer, which are often tinged with purple or pink. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in wet meadows, bogs, and heaths. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various invertebrates."
