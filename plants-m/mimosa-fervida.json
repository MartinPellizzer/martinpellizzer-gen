It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch or temperature changes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
