    "intro": "Mecodium gardneri, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woolly, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to store water efficiently, adapting to drought conditions. Mecodium gardneri is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
