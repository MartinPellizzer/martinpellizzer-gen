    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. timeroyi, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in some areas for forage or as a cover plant."
