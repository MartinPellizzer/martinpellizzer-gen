    "intro": "Mahernia scoparia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing capsules. Its leaves are usually hairy and narrow, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Mahernia scoparia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
