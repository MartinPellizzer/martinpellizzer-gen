    "intro": "Meriania macrophylla subsp. antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian starlingwood, is a species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Its foliage and fruit make it an important component of the local ecosystem, supporting biodiversity in its native habitat. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
