    "intro": "Morus alba f. tatarica, commonly known as the Tatarian mulberry, is a compact, ornamental variety of the white mulberry. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight pubescence. This form is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production. The plant is native to eastern Asia and is well adapted to temperate climates. It exhibits a slower growth rate compared to the standard white mulberry, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
