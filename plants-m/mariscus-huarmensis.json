    "intro": "Mariscus huarmensis, commonly known as the Huarm\u00e9nsis marsh plant, is a rare species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or red, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mariscus huarmensis is considered a vulnerable species."
