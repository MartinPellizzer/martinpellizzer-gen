It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is considered rare in the wild."
