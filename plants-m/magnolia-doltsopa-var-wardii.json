    "intro": "Magnolia doltsopa var. wardii, commonly known as the Ward's magnolia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a glossy surface. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
