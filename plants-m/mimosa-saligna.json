    "intro": "Mimosa saligna, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Mimosa saligna is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
