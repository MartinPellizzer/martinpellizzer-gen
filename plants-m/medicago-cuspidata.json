    "intro": "Medicago cuspidata, commonly known as the needle medic, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Medicago cuspidata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and as a forage crop."
