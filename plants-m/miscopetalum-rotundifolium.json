    "intro": "Miscopetalum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs. It has small, rounded leaves and produces white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host plant. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is often considered a weed in forest ecosystems."
