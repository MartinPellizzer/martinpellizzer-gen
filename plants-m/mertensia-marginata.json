    "intro": "Mertensia marginata, commonly known as the bluebells of the eastern United States, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Appalachian region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in early spring. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Mertensia marginata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
