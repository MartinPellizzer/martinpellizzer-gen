    "intro": "Medicago minima subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent goatweed, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
