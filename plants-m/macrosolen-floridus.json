    "intro": "Macrosolen floridus, commonly known as the Florida macrolen, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a velvety texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
