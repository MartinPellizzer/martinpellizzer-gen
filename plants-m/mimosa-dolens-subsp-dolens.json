    "intro": "Mimosa dolens subsp. dolens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold inward and droop when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, ball-shaped flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and unique foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can become invasive in some regions."
