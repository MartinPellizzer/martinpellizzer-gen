    "intro": "Meliosma subverticiliaris, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elliptical, red-brown fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species in its native habitat."
