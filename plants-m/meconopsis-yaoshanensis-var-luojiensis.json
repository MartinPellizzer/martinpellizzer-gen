    "intro": "Meconopsis yaoshanensis var. luojiensis, commonly known as the Luojiensis Meconopsis, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in cool, moist, and shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, while its stem is erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
