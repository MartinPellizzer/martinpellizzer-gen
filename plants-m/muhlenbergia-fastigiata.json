    "intro": "Muhlenbergia fastigiata, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in ornamental gardening for their visual appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia fastigiata is well-suited for erosion control and is often used in native plant gardens."
