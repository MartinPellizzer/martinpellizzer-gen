    "intro": "Manihot divergens, commonly known as arrowleaf manioc, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrowhead base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by yellowish fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its roots are the primary part used, though they contain cyanogenic glycosides and require careful processing before consumption. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in various indigenous cultures."
