It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in summer. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to dry climates. Its common name derives from the frost-like appearance of its leaves when covered in morning dew."
