    "intro": "Maxillaria supina, commonly known as the lying maxillaria, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces fragrant, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn and are known for their distinctive, downward-facing orientation. Maxillaria supina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
