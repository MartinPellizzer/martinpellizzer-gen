    "intro": "Melica latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Melica latifolia is often found in wetland ecosystems and is an important component of riparian vegetation."
