    "intro": "Medinilla humilis, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or small medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling miniature orchids. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal. Medinilla humilis is also valued for its ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care."
