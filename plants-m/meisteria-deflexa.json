    "intro": "Meisteria deflexa, commonly known as the flexible meisteria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique growth habit involves a spiral twisting of its stems, which helps it maximize sunlight exposure. Due to habitat loss, Meisteria deflexa is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
