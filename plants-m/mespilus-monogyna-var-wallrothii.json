    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. wallrothii, commonly known as the Wallroth's whitebeam, is a rare and ancient species native to parts of Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a small, round drupe that ripens in late summer, providing food for various wildlife. This variety is noted for its slow growth and longevity, often living for centuries in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
