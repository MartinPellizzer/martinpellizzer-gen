    "intro": "Malnaregam, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging plants like nettle and hemp. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy surface that can cause skin irritation upon contact. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits. Malnaregam is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
