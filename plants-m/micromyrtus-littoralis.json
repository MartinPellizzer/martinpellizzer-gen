    "intro": "Micromyrtus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, aromatic flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
