    "intro": "Monotropanthum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the nightshade family and is characterized by its striking, pale blue or white flowers. The plant has a short lifespan, often blooming only once before dying, which makes it a rare and ephemeral species. Its flowers open at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Botanically, it is notable for its simple structure and adaptations to arid environments."
