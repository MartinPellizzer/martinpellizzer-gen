    "intro": "Microchilus bravocollinus, commonly known as the bold-necked microchilus, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique floral structure and coloration are adaptations that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
