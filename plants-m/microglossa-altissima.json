    "intro": "Microglossa altissima, commonly known as the tall microglossa, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to specific alpine habitats in Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its growth is often limited to rocky or shaded areas, reflecting its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Microglossa altissima is considered a vulnerable species."
