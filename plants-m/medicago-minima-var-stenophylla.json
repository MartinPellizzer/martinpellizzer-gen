    "intro": "Medicago minima var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a taproot system and is adapted to dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Narrow-leaf sainfoin is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
