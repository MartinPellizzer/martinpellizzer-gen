    "intro": "Macropharynx, commonly known as the giant swallowtail. It is a type of butterfly belonging to the family Papilionidae, known for its large size and striking wing patterns. The plant it pollinates, such as certain species of citrus and parsley, plays a crucial role in its life cycle. Its larvae feed on these plants, making them essential for the butterfly's development. The botanical relationships between the Macropharynx and its host plants highlight the importance of plant-insect interactions in ecosystems."
