    "intro": "Myrtus complicata, commonly known as the creeping myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries. Myrtus complicata is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in hedges or ground cover due to its dense growth habit. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine."
