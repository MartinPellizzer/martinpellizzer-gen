    "intro": "Moquilea corniculata, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and pairs of opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature of the species. Moquilea corniculata plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is often found in dry, sandy soils."
