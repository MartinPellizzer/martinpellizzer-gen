It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, aiding in moisture retention. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale blue, blooming in the spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage structure."
