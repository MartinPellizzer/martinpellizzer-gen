    "intro": "Mariscus beyrichii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and southern Angola. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its native range."
