    "intro": "Malvastrum betonicifolium, commonly known as the common mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a soft, hairy texture, and produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its robust growth habit and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like hibiscus and cotton. Its fibrous roots and sprawling stems make it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
