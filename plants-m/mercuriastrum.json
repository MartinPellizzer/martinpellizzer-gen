    "intro": "Mercuriastrum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Mercuriastrum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in woodland and scrub habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
