    "intro": "Maytenus longistipitata, commonly known as the long-stemmed mayten, is a species of flowering plant in the family Simaroubaeaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions of Mexico, Belize, and parts of the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Maytenus longistipitata is valued for its ecological role and has been studied for potential medicinal properties."
