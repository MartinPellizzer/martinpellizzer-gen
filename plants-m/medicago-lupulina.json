    "intro": "Medicago lupulina, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and disturbed areas. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
