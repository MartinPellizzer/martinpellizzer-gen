It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and spikes of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is valued for its strong menthol scent and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and soothing properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variant is closely related to other mint species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and geographical distribution."
