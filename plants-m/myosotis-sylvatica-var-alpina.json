It is characterized by its small, blue or violet petals that are typically arranged in a five-petaled cluster. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem."
