    "intro": "Marsilea elata var. crenata, commonly known as the water clover, is a submerged aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four oval lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. It reproduces through spores, which are released into the water and germinate into new plants. This species is often used in aquatic gardens and is a popular choice for ornamental water features due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
