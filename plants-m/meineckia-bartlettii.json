    "intro": "Meineckia bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's meineckia, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red and purple.
