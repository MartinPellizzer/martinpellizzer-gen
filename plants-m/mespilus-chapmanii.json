    "intro": "Mespilus chapmanii, commonly known as the Chapman's medlar, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically harvested in late summer, though they are not widely consumed by humans. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
