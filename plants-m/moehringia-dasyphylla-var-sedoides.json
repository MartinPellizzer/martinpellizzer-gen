    "intro": "Moehringia dasyphylla var. sedoides, commonly known as the Sierra needleleaf, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are needle-like, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions."
