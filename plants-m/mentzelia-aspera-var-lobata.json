    "intro": "Mentzelia aspera var. lobata, commonly known as the roughleaf bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb with hairy, often glandular stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and rough to the touch. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its distinctive morphology and habitat make it an important species for ecological studies in arid regions."
