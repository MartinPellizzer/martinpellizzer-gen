    "intro": "Masdevallia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered masdevallia, is a tropical orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to produce numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on tree branches or rocks. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting the plant's foliage and flowering structure. Masdevallia racemosa is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
