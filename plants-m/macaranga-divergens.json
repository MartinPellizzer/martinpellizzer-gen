    "intro": "Macaranga divergens, commonly known as the broadleaf or elephant's foot tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
