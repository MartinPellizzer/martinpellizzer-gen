    "intro": "Mimosa pellita, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Mimosa pellita thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and unique response to touch make it a popular choice for educational and ornamental purposes."
