    "intro": "Monotropa uniflora var. typica, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic flowering plant native to eastern North America. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi to obtain nutrients from its host trees. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower that is typically white or pale green. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing in association with hemlock or fir trees. Due to its unique ecological role and delicate appearance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
