    "intro": "Maxillaria praetexta, commonly known as the spotted maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple with contrasting yellow or white markings. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria praetexta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
