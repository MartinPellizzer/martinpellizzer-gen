It is characterized by its tall, gracefully arching clumps of slender, silver-green foliage. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes in late summer, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and ability to attract pollinators."
