    "intro": "Mikania brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to white. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It has a fibrous root system and can spread aggressively through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
