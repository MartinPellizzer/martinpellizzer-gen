    "intro": "Matricaria inodora var. phaeocephala, commonly known as the pale-headed chamomile, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers with a pale, almost brownish center, which distinguish it from other chamomile varieties. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, contributing to its medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats. This variety is valued for its calming properties and is used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
