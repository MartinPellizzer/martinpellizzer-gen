    "intro": "Millettia warneckei, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces woody pods that contain flattened, seed-like structures called samaras. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can grow up to 20 meters tall. Due to its rapid growth and hardy nature, it is sometimes used for reforestation and as a shade tree."
