    "intro": "Melochia odorata, commonly known as the sweet flag or the stinkweed, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to several meters in height, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, aiding in its propagation. Melochia odorata is often found in moist, shady environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
