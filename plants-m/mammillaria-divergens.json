    "intro": "Mammillaria divergens, commonly known as the Mexican moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a short, thick stem and a cluster of spines. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are typically absent, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic structure. Mammillaria divergens is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and exhibiting a range of color variations in its body."
