    "intro": "Mandragora foemina, commonly known as the female mandrake, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East, thriving in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers and has distinctive, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. Its most notable feature is its root, which is shaped like a human figure and has been historically associated with magical and medicinal properties. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it both a potent and dangerous species in traditional herbal medicine."
