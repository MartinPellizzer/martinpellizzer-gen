    "intro": "Masdevallia aops, commonly known as the \"Pineapple Orchid,\" is a tropical orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pineapple-shaped inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, colorful flowers clustered together. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Masdevallia aops thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
