    "intro": "Mikania subcrenata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Its leaves are heart-shaped with wavy edges, and it thrives in moist, sunny environments. Mikania subcrenata is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, making it a common weed in tropical and subtropical areas."
