    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa nothosubsp. praefalcata, commonly known as the sticky medick, is a hybrid subspecies within the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Medicago species. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in open, disturbed habitats. It produces small, sticky seeds that aid in dispersal by adhering to animals or clothing. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits genetic variability and is of interest in studies of plant evolution and adaptation."
