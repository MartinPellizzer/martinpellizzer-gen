    "intro": "Mahonia borealis, commonly known as the northern mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a serrated edge. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Mahonia borealis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in cooler climates."
