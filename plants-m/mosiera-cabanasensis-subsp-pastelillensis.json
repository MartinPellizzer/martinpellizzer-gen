    "intro": "Mosiera cabanasensis subsp. pastelillensis, commonly known as the Pastelilla mosiera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbels and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent, while its flowers are small and white, forming umbrella-like clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
