    "intro": "Melampyrum mulkijanianii, commonly known as the Armenian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
