    "intro": "Malabaila platyptera, commonly known as the broad-winged nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. It produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and is more commonly found in the wild."
