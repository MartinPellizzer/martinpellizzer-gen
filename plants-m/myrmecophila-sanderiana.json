    "intro": "Myrmecophila sanderiana, commonly known as the sanders' antplant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. The plant has specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, stem-like formations that serve as ant habitats. Its leaves are typically small and clustered, contributing to its compact appearance. Myrmecophila sanderiana is also known for its delicate white or pink flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators."
