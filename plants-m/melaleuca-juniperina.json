    "intro": "Melaleuca juniperina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that releases small, winged seeds when mature. Melaleuca juniperina is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
