    "intro": "Merremia clemensiana, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces vibrant yellow flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, hairy stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically followed by capsule fruits that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Merremia clemensiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
