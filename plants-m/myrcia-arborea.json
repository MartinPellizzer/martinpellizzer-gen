    "intro": "Myrcia arborea, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas. Myrcia arborea has a dense root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
