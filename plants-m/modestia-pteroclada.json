    "intro": "Modestia pteroclada, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and unique, often fragrant blooms that resemble orchids in structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, fibrous root system. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Modestia pteroclada is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
