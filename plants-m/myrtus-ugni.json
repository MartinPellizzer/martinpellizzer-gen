    "intro": "Myrtus ugni, commonly known as the winter honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is evergreen, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental gardens. Its flowers are rich in nectar, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The berries that follow the flowers are edible and have a tart, honey-sweet flavor."
