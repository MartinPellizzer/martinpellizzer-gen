    "intro": "Mimosa martiusiana, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
