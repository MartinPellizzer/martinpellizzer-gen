    "intro": "Macleania farinosa, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which are often dispersed by birds. Macleania farinosa is characterized by its unique parasitic relationship with host trees, drawing nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria."
