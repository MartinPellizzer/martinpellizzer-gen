    "intro": "Mimosa polyancistra, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Mimosa polyancistra is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various climates."
