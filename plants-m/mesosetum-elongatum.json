    "intro": "Mesosetum elongatum, commonly known as the longleaf mesosetum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Mesosetum elongatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
