    "intro": "Mentha bastardiana, commonly known as the bastard mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a strong, minty aroma due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mentha bastardiana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
