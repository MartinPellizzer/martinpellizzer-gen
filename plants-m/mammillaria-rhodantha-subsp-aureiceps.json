    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha subsp. aureiceps, commonly known as the golden-headed hedgehog cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, spiny body with a distinctive golden or yellowish hue on its areoles, which are covered in white to yellowish hairs. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
