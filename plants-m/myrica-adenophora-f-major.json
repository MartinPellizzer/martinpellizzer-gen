    "intro": "Myrica adenophora f. major, commonly known as the large-fruited wax myrtle, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves and small, dark blue berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive berries. This variety is notable for its larger fruit size compared to other forms of Myrica adenophora."
