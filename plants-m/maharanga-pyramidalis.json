    "intro": "Maharanga pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive pyramidal inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, bell-shaped flowers arranged in a cone-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the rainforest understory. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom during the rainy season and attract various pollinators such as bees and moths."
