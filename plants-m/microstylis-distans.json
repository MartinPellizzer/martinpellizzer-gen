    "intro": "Microstylis distans, commonly known as the slender-styled grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, delicate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Microstylis distans plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
