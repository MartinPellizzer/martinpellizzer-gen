    "intro": "Minuartia verna var. brachypetala, commonly known as the spring rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. This variety is distinguished by its shorter petals compared to the typical form of Minuartia verna."
