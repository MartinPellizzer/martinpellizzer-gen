    "intro": "Micropus erectus subsp. bombycinus, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and emits a milky sap when damaged. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is notable for its role in supporting native pollinators and its ornamental value in xeriscaping."
