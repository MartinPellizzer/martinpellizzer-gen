    "intro": "Monophyllorchis idroboi, commonly known as the Idrobo's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
