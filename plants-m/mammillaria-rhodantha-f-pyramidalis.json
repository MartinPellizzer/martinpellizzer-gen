    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. The plant features small, pale green to pinkish flowers that appear in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental value. This variety is notable for its unique pyramidal growth form, which distinguishes it from other members of the Mammillaria genus."
