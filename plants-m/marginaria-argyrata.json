    "intro": "Marginaria argyrata, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight, reducing water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Marginaria argyrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
