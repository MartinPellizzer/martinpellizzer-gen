    "intro": "Mesotriche, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the mud, while its stems support the heavy leaves. Mesotriche plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
