It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces numerous slender, twining stems that can cover large areas, often forming dense thickets. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a common component of the understory in tropical forests. Mikania amazonica is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional remedies."
