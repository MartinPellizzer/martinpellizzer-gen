It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers adapted to arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
