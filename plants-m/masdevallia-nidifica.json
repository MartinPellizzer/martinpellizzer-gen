    "intro": "Masdevallia nidifica, commonly known as the nest orchid, is a rare and exquisite member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in high-altitude, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique floral structure, with intricate patterns and vivid hues, makes it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Masdevallia nidifica is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
