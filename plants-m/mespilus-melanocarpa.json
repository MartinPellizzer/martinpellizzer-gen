    "intro": "Mespilus melanocarpa, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The blackthorn thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
