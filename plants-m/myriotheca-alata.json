    "intro": "Myriotheca alata, commonly known as the winged thornvetch, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems covered in stiff, wing-like structures that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. Myriotheca alata is often found in open areas such as scrublands and along coastal cliffs."
