It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and slender stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a broad, fleshy lip that is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
