    "intro": "Miconia crassinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas where it has been introduced."
