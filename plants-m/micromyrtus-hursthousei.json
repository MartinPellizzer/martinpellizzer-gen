    "intro": "Micromyrtus hursthousei, commonly known as the Hursthouse's paperbark, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, papery inner layer. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Micromyrtus hursthousei is adapted to sandy soils and is often found growing in open, coastal environments."
