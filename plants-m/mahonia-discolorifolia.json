    "intro": "Mahonia discolorifolia, commonly known as the variegated mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, compound leaves that display a mix of green, yellow, and white variegation, making it a visually appealing plant. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Mahonia discolorifolia thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its foliage and seasonal interest."
