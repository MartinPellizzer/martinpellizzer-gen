    "intro": "Melica major, commonly known as tall brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
