    "intro": "Matelea tristiflora, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The fruit is a follicle that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
