    "intro": "Monardella nana subsp. arida, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant features small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
