    "intro": "Maidenia acroptera, commonly known as the scarlet waxflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
