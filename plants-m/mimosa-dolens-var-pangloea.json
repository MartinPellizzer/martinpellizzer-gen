    "intro": "Mimosa dolens var. pangloea, commonly known as the Pacific mimosa, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Oregon. It features slender, branching stems covered in soft, fuzzy gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which open in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, with numerous tiny leaflets that close when disturbed. This species thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments."
