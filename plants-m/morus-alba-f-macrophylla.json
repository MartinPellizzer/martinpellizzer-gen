    "intro": "Morus alba f. macrophylla, commonly known as the white mulberry with large leaves, is a cultivar of the white mulberry tree. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are significantly larger than those of the typical Morus alba. The plant is native to Asia but has been widely cultivated in various parts of the world. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are edible and used in traditional medicine and as a food source for silkworms. The large leaves make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks."
