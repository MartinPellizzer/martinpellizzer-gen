    "intro": "Melanthium monopetalum, commonly known as the single-petaled meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its basal leaves that are deeply lobed and its showy, yellowish-green flowers with a single petal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a short, unbranched stem and small, greenish-yellow sepals that surround the single petal. Melanthium monopetalum is often found in association with other woodland flora and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
