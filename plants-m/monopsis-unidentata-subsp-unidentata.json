    "intro": "Monopsis unidentata subsp. unidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf monopsis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open grasslands or rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
