    "intro": "Morus morettii, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to China and other parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically large and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fibrous bark, which is used in papermaking and textile production. The tree also has historical significance in traditional medicine and as a source of food for silkworms."
