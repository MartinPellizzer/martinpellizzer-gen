    "intro": "Melica animarum, commonly known as the sacred grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica animarum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
