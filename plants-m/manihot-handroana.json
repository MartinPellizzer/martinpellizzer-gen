    "intro": "Manihot handroana, commonly known as the red-rooted arrowleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically three to five lobed and have a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
