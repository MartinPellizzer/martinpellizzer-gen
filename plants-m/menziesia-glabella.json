    "intro": "Menziesia glabella, commonly known as the smooth menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and dark green. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. Menziesia glabella thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
