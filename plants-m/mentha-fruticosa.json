    "intro": "Mentha fruticosa, commonly known as hedge mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale purple or white flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Hedge mint is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is widely used in herbal medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
