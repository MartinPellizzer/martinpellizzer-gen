    "intro": "Micromeria abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit, often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. It has hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
