    "intro": "Mimosa canastrensis, commonly known as the Argentine sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. Its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in racemes, blooming in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
