    "intro": "Malpighia serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine beauty, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils, particularly those rich in serpentine minerals, which influence its unique adaptations. It produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. The species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized habitat and genetic adaptations to metal-rich environments."
