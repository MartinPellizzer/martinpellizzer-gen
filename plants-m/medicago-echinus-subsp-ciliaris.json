It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The subspecies ciliaris is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves with distinctive ciliate margins."
