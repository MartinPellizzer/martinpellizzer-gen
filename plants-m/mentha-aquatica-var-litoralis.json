    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. litoralis, commonly known as sea mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. This plant thrives in moist, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal zones. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though they have a more delicate flavor compared to other mint varieties. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife."
