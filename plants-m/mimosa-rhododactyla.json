    "intro": "Mimosa rhododactyla, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to fix nitrogen through root nodules also contributes to soil enrichment."
