It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Marrubium flexuosum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
