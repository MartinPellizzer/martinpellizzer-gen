    "intro": "Myroxylon velutinum, commonly known as the copal tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and resinous sap. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin layers. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant is notable for producing a valuable gum resin, which has been historically used in incense and varnishes."
