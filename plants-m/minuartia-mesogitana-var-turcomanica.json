It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, dry climates with limited nutrient availability."
