    "intro": "Metaporana parvifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed metaporana, is a rare flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a distinct silvery underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
