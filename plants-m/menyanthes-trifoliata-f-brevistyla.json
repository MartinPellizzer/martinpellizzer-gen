    "intro": "Menyanthes trifoliata f. brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-styled water mint, is a rare variant of the water mint species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its small, narrow floral structures and reduced stamen length, distinguishing it from the typical form. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three rounded lobes and produces small, fragrant white flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
