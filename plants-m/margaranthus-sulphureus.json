    "intro": "Margaranthus sulphureus, commonly known as the golden margarita, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its bright blooms. Margaranthus sulphureus is a perennial shrub that is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
