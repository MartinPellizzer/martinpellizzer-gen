    "intro": "Micromeria juliana f. barbulata, commonly known as the woolly micromeria, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of California. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive fuzzy, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, delicate flowers are usually white or pale green, and it is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
