These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Mexico and Central America, and are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers. Morrenia species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are usually tubular or funnel-shaped with prominent stamens. They thrive in tropical and subtropical climates and are often found in dry, rocky soils. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique and showy blooms."
