    "intro": "Monophyllaea insignis, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous species that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other coastal flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
