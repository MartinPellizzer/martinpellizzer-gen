    "intro": "Medicago rotata, commonly known as the small medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Medicago rotata is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in ecological restoration projects."
