    "intro": "Melaleuca curvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and swampy areas. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, revealing a pale inner layer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a reddish or pale green hue, and it produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers. This species is well adapted to wet environments and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common feature in wetlands and riverine habitats."
