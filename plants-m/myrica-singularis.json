    "intro": "Myrica singularis, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Myrica singularis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
