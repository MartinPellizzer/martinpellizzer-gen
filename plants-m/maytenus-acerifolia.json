    "intro": "Maytenus acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf mayten, is a species of flowering plant in the family Phyllanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its alternate, palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Maytenus acerifolia is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage and potential medicinal properties."
