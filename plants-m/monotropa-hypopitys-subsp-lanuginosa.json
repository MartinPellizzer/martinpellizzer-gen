    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy ghost plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its hairy, glandular stems and leaves are distinctive features. It thrives in shaded, moist forest understories, often growing in association with specific fungi."
