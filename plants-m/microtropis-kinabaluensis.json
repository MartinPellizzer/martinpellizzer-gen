    "intro": "Microtropis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu microtropis, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the high altitudes of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in the cool, moist conditions of the montane forest ecosystem. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
