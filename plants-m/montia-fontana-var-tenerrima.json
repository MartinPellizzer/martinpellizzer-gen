    "intro": "Montia fontana var. tenerrima, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a delicate annual herb native to the western United States. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are white or pale pink, clustered in racemes, and are pollinated by insects. This variety is closely related to other Montia species and is valued for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly cultivated than its more well-known relatives."
