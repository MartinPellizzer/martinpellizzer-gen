It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually blue or violet, and are clustered in loose inflorescences.
