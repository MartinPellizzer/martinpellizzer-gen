    "intro": "Mariscus sumatrensis var. khasianus, commonly known as the Sumatran mariscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests and is often found in high-altitude regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
