    "intro": "Melica nebrodensis var. magnolii, commonly known as the Magnolia grass, is a rare and distinctive grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a preference for well-drained, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
