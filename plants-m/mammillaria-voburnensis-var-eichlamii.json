    "intro": "Mammillaria voburnensis var. eichlamii, commonly known as the Eichlam's gloomy mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dark green color and spiny, white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
