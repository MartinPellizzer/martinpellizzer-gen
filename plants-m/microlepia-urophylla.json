    "intro": "Microlepia urophylla, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
