    "intro": "Morinda litoralis, commonly known as sea morinda, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Morinda litoralis is adapted to saline and tidal environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
