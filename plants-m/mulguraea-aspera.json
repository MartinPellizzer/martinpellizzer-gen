    "intro": "Mulguraea aspera, commonly known as the rough mulga, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the genus Mulguraea within the family Myrtaceae, which includes many aromatic and woody plants. The plant is characterized by its rough, greyish bark and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in clusters. The rough mulga is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to withstand prolonged droughts."
