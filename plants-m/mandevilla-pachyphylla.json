    "intro": "Mandevilla pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved mandevilla, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the warmer months. It is a climbing vine that can reach considerable lengths, making it suitable for trellises or as a landscape accent. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and horticultural collections."
