    "intro": "Mentha oblongifolia, commonly known as broad-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. Mentha oblongifolia is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
