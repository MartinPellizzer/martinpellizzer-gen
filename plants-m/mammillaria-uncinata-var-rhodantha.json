It features a ribbed stem with prominent areoles, from which both white and red bristles emerge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fleshy, spiny structure is adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
