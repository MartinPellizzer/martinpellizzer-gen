    "intro": "Medicago pubescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it often grows in disturbed soils. Medicago pubescens is also valued as a forage crop and for its ecological benefits in soil enrichment."
