    "intro": "Miconia urticilamina, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia urticilamina is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings due to its adaptability. It is also known for its rapid growth and potential as an invasive species in some regions."
