It features a globular shape with cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
