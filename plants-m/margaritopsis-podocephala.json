    "intro": "Margaritopsis podocephala, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine and rocky habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features a short rhizome with a single, erect stem that bears a single flower cluster. Its leaves are often small, linear, and arranged in a rosette pattern to conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Margaritopsis podocephala is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
