    "intro": "Myrcia racemosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Myrcia racemosa has a strong, spicy aroma and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
