    "intro": "Microcarpaea diandra, commonly known as the golden star or yellow star bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, contributing to its natural spread."
