    "intro": "Marsilea diffusa f. microcarpa, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features small, floating leaves that are divided into four oval lobes, resembling the shape of a clover. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by wind, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, forming dense mats that can provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental in water gardens."
