    "intro": "Mammillaria formosa subsp. pseudocrucigera, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a compact cactus native to the deserts of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are small, rounded growths. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
