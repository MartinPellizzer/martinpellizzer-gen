    "intro": "Moraea odora, commonly known as the sweet moraea, is a striking perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, nodding flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces showy, tubular blooms that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Moraea odora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
