    "intro": "Melothria diversifolia, commonly known as the creeping mullet or small red mullet, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by bright orange, fleshy fruits resembling miniature watermelons. Its fruit is edible, though often considered a wild vegetable, and is used in traditional cuisines for its tart flavor. Melothria diversifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
