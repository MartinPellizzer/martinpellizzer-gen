    "intro": "Medicago echinus, commonly known as the spiny medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves with distinctive spines on the leaflets. The plant is characterized by its robust root system and ability to thrive in poor, dry soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is used in some regions for forage or soil stabilization. Medicago echinus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
