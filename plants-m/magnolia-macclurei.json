    "intro": "Magnolia macclurei, commonly known as the MacClure magnolia, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
