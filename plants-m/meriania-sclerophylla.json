    "intro": "Meriania sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock apple or rock pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with rocky or limestone soils. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically thick and leathery, an adaptation to its often arid or nutrient-poor environment. Its flowers are showy, with five petals, and often display vibrant colors such as red or pink. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals."
