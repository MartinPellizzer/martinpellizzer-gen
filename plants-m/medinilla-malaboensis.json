    "intro": "Medinilla malaboensis, commonly known as the Malabo Medinilla, is a tropical shrub native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It is characterized by its clustered, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical rainforests. Medinilla malaboensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
