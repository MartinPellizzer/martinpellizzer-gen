    "intro": "Miconia obtusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Miconia obtusa has been introduced to other regions and is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature."
