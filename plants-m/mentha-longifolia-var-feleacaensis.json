    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. feleacaensis, commonly known as the Feleacaensis mint, is a rare variant of the long-leaf mint. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Europe, particularly in Romania. The plant is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to violet flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic traits, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
