    "intro": "Mollugo glinoides, commonly known as the sticky sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ground cover for rocky or sandy landscapes. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry environments with minimal care."
