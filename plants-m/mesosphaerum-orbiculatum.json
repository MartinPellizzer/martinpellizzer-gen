    "intro": "Mesosphaerum orbiculatum, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, rounded thallus. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green color and a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. It has a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the photosynthetic capability necessary for the lichen's survival. Mesosphaerum orbiculatum plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
