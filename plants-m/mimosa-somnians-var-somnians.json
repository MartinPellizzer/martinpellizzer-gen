    "intro": "Mimosa somnians var. somnians, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, ball-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings."
