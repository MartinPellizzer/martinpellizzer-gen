    "intro": "Myrmechis seranica, commonly known as the sandhill myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are produced in clusters during the spring. Myrmechis seranica is often found in coastal heathlands and is an important component of the local flora."
