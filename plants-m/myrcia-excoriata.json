    "intro": "Myrcia excoriata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when ripe, containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
