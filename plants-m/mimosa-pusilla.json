    "intro": "Mimosa pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a small herbaceous species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its rapid growth and low maintenance requirements make it a favored plant for ornamental purposes."
