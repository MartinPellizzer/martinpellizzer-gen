    "intro": "Medicago minima var. recta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive narrow shape and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility, and is sometimes used in forage and erosion control. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
