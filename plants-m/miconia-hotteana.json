    "intro": "Miconia hotteana, commonly known as the purple miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia hotteana is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
