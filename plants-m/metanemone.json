    "intro": "Metanemone, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or greenish flowers that appear in early spring. The plants typically have smooth, waxy leaves and are native to regions of Europe and Asia. Metanemone species are often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to their toxic compounds, they are generally avoided by herbivores and can be hazardous if ingested."
