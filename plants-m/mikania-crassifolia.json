    "intro": "Mikania crassifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
