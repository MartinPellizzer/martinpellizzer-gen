    "intro": "Monomesia, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and its showy, often pink or red, flowers. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and its flowers are clustered in umbels. Monomesia plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
