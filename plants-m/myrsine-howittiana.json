    "intro": "Myrsine howittiana, commonly known as the Howitt's myrsine, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Myrsine howittiana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories along the eastern coast of New Zealand. Its botanical features make it an important component of the region's unique flora."
