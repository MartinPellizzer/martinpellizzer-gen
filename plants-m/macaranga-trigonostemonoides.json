    "intro": "Macaranga trigonostemonoides, commonly known as the giant mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
