    "intro": "Maquira grandifolia, commonly known as the Amazonian mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and broad, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its high-quality, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
