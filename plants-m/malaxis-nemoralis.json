    "intro": "Malaxis nemoralis, commonly known as the woodland marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its roots are fibrous, and it produces small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The species is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
