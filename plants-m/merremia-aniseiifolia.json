    "intro": "Merremia aniseiifolia, commonly known as the anise-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves that resemble anise leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and as a ground cover. The seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny capsule that disperses easily by wind."
