    "intro": "Minuria suaedifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Minuria suaedifolia is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
