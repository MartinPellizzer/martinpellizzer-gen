    "intro": "Mesosphaerum dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters, with hairy, fleshy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Mesosphaerum dilatatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and succulent tissues that store water. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
