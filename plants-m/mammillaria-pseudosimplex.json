    "intro": "Mammillaria pseudosimplex, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short stem and a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
