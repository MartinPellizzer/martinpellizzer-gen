    "intro": "Messerschmidia fruticosa, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like species with woody stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and open in the morning, hence its common name. It has small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Messerschmidia fruticosa is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
