    "intro": "Monticalia tolimensis var. colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian monticalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and ixora, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
