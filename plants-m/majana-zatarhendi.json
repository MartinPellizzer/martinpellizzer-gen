    "intro": "Majana zatarhendi, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
