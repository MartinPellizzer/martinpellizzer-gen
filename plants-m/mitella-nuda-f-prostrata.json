    "intro": "Mitella nuda f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate mitella, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its delicate appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
