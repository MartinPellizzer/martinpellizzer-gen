    "intro": "Microlepia haflangensis, commonly known as the Haflang's sword fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microlepia haflangensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
