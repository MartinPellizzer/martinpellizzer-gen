    "intro": "Munroidendron racemosum, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
