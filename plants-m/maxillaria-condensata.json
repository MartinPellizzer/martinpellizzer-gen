    "intro": "Maxillaria condensata, commonly known as the condensed maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, with petals that often have a slight curl and a waxy texture. Its leaves are strap-like, arranged in a fan shape, and are usually dark green with a smooth surface. Maxillaria condensata prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
