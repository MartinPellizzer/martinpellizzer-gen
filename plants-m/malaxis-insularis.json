    "intro": "Malaxis insularis, commonly known as the island marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It typically grows in damp, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with a single or few flowering spikes, each bearing small, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers. Its flowers are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence, a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Malaxis insularis is known for its delicate appearance and is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
