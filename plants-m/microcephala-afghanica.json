    "intro": "Microcephala afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan microcephala, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its morphology includes a short, stout stem and clusters of small, aromatic fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
