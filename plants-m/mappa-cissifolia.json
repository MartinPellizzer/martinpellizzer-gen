    "intro": "Mappa cissifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Mappa cissifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
