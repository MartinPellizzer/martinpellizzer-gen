    "intro": "Mimusops useguhensis, commonly known as the Guhensis satinleaf, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange or red berries containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
