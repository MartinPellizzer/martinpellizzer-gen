    "intro": "Melastoma strangulatum, commonly known as the strangler melastoma, is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its growth habit can be invasive in certain areas, making it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic."
