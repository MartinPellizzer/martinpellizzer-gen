    "intro": "Minuartiella, commonly known as the rock mouse-ear, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. These small, mat-forming plants are typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Minuartiella species are characterized by their compact growth habit, with tiny, often blue or white flowers that bloom in the spring. They possess a succulent appearance, with fleshy leaves that help them retain moisture in harsh conditions. Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, many species within this genus are considered rare or endangered."
