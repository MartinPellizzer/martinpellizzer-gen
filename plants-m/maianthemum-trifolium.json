    "intro": "Maianthemum trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf grass or false lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features a low-growing, rhizomatous stem that produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant's leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in forest understories. Maianthemum trifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
