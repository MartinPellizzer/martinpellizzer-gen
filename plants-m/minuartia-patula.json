It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh, dry conditions. Minuartia patula is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
