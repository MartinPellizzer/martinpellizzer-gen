It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique tri-angled stems and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
