    "intro": "Mikania stygia, commonly known as the giant flame vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in some regions."
