    "intro": "Micranthes eriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pincushion, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, surrounded by dense, woolly foliage. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Micranthes eriophora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
