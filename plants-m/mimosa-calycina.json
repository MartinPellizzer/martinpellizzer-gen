    "intro": "Mimosa calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by sensitive leaflets called pulvini. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is often smooth and may have a reddish or brownish hue. Mimosa calycina is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments."
