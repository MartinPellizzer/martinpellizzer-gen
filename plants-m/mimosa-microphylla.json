    "intro": "Mimosa microphylla, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Mimosa microphylla thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
