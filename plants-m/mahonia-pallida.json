    "intro": "Mahonia pallida, commonly known as the white-flowered mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Mahonia pallida thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
