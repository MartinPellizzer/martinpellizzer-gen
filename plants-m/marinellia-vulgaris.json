    "intro": "Marinellia vulgaris, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Marinellia vulgaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
