    "intro": "Mariscus dactyliformis, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Mariscus dactyliformis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living relic of early plant evolution."
