    "intro": "Marica, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture. Due to overharvesting, marica is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
