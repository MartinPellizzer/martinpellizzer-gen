    "intro": "Meeboldia achilleifolia, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
