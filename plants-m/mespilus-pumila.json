    "intro": "Mespilus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small cherries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. Mespilus pumila is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
