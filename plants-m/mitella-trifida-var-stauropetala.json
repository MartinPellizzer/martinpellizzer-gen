It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branching. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral morphology, which sets it apart from other members of the Mitella genus."
