    "intro": "Myriophyllum capillaceum, commonly known as water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically found near the water surface. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms. Myriophyllum capillaceum is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb pollutants from water."
