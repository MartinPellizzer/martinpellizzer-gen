    "intro": "Mercurialis sericea, commonly known as silverleaf mercury. It is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, characterized by its silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is often considered a weed but has been studied for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
