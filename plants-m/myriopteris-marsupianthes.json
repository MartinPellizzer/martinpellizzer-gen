    "intro": "Myriopteris marsupianthes, commonly known as the western marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in a rosette form, often emerging from a central rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wetlands, and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's ability to tolerate wet conditions makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
