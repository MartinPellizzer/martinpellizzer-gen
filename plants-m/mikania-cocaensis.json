It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread through wind and animals. Mikania cocaensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
