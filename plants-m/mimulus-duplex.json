    "intro": "Mimulus duplex, commonly known as the double monkeyflower, is a species native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its striking, bright orange or red flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers consist of two sets of petals, giving it the \"double\" appearance that distinguishes it from other mimulus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
