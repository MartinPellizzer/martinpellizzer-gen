    "intro": "Matelea producta, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Matelea producta is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
