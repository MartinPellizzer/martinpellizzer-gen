    "intro": "Mayepea montana, commonly known as the mountain mayepea, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Mayepea montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
