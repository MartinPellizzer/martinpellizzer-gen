    "intro": "Morrenia odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented morrenia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Morrenia odorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
