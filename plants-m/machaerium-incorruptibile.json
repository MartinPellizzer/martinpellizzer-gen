    "intro": "Machaerium incorruptibile, commonly known as the everlasting grass, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in disturbed soils. Machaerium incorruptibile is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
