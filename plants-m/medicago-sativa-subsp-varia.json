    "intro": "Medicago sativa subsp. varia, commonly known as variable medic, is a wild legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from trifoliate to palmate, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in natural habitats."
