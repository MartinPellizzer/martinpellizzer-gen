    "intro": "Medinilla cordata, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet leaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive red calyx, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and delicate floral display. Medinilla cordata is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas due to its preference for high humidity and indirect light."
