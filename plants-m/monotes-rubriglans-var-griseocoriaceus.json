    "intro": "Monotes rubriglans var. griseocoriaceus, commonly known as the gray-coriaceous monotes, is a rare and unique variant of the monotes genus. It is characterized by its distinctive grayish, coriaceous (leathery) foliage, which gives it a rugged appearance. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dense, overlapping leaves that provide a protective layer against environmental stress. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical or subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for taxonomic study and conservation efforts."
