    "intro": "Magnolia compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its ovate, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of other magnolia species. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Magnolia compressa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
