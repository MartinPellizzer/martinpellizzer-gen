    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri var. degenii, commonly known as Degen's hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha viridis and Mentha suaveolens, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often aromatic and covered in fine pubescence. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters during the summer months. This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other mint species, and is often cultivated for its refreshing scent and flavor."
