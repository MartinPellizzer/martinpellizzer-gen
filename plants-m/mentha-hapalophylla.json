It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their cooling and digestive properties. Mentha hapalophylla is closely related to other members of the mint family, sharing similar aromatic compounds and growth habits."
