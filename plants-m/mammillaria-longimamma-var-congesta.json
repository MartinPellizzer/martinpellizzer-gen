    "intro": "Mammillaria longimamma var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered long-mamma cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense arrangement of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has short, spiny areoles that bear white to brown glochids, which are fine, hair-like spines. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
