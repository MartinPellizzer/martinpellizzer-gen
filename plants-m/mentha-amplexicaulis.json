    "intro": "Mentha amplexicaulis, commonly known as the creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorls along the upper stems. Mentha amplexicaulis is known for its aromatic leaves, which contain essential oils responsible for its minty scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
