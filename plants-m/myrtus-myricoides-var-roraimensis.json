    "intro": "Myrtus myricoides var. roraimensis, commonly known as Roraima myrtle, is a shrub native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and glossy, with a fragrant aroma. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
