    "intro": "Mammillaria vivipara var. radiosa, commonly known as the radiate mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a viviparous species, meaning it gives birth to live offspring through the production of seedlings on its stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a well-drained soil environment."
