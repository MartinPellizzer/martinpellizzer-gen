    "intro": "Myrcia circumdata, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically clustered in small groups and are usually pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it matures."
