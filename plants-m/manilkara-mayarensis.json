It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces a fruit similar to a sapodilla, with a sweet, creamy pulp that is often used in local cuisines. Its latex, which is milky and sticky, has been traditionally used for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive and in the production of rubber."
