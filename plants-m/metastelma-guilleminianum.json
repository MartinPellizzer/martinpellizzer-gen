    "intro": "Metastelma guilleminianum, commonly known as the Guilleminianum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, fleshy berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees."
