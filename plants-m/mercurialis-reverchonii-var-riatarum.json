    "intro": "Mercurialis reverchonii var. riatarum, commonly known as the coastal mercury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local insect populations."
