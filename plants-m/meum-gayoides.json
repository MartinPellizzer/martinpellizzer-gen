    "intro": "Meum gayoides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow-orange disc flowers surrounded by blue to violet ray florets, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Meum gayoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along shorelines and in maritime habitats."
