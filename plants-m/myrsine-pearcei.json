    "intro": "Myrsine pearcei, commonly known as the New Zealand myrsine, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Myrsine pearcei typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of New Zealand's unique flora."
