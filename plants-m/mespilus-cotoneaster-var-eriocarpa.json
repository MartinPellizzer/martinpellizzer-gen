    "intro": "Mespilus cotoneaster var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The variety is characterized by its dense, woolly hairs on the stems and young leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance."
