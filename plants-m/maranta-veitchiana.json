It belongs to the Marantaceae family, which includes many ornamental plants known for their striking foliage. The plant is characterized by its glossy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, red, and pink. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which appear in clusters. Maranta veitchiana is primarily grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive leaves rather than its flowers."
