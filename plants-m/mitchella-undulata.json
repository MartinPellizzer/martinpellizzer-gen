    "intro": "Mitchella undulata, commonly known as the wavy wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a wavy margin, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Mitchella undulata is often found in rich, loamy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
