    "intro": "Mikania argyrostigma, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its other name. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Mikania argyrostigma is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
