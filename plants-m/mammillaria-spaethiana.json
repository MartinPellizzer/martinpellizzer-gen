    "intro": "Mammillaria spaethiana, commonly known as the Spaeth's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and prominent tubercles that give it a spiny, hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
