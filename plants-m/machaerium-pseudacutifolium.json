It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in the wild. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
