    "intro": "Martianthus sancti-gabrielii, commonly known as the Saint-Gabriel's Martian Flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant with unique botanical characteristics. It features elongated, translucent leaves that exhibit a bioluminescent glow under moonlight, a trait not commonly observed in terrestrial flora. The plant's flowers are small, star-shaped, and emit a faint, sweet aroma that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, mineral-rich soil of its extraterrestrial habitat. Despite its otherworldly appearance, it shares some genetic similarities with Earth's flowering plants, suggesting a possible evolutionary link."
