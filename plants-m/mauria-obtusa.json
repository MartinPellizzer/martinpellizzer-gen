It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily.
