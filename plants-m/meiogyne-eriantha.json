    "intro": "Meiogyne eriantha, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation. Meiogyne eriantha plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality regulation."
