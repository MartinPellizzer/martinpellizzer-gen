    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. pusilla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and stream sides in Europe and Asia. It has slender, aromatic leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, with a distinct minty scent. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
