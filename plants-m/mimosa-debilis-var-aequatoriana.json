    "intro": "Mimosa debilis var. aequatoriana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
