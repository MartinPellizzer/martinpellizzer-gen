    "intro": "Mespilus laevis, commonly known as the white service tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet, yellow berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or hedgerow environments. Mespilus laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
