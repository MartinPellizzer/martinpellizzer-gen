    "intro": "Malus violacea, commonly known as the pink-flowered apple tree, is a species native to China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge and turn yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, sour apple that is not typically consumed by humans but is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
