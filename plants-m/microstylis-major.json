    "intro": "Microstylis major, commonly known as the broad-leafed microstylis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Microstylis major plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often found in association with other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants."
