    "intro": "Mearnsia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their long, narrow leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Mearnsia species are adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making them resilient in harsh climates. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for pollinators."
