    "intro": "Microcodon sparsiflorus, commonly known as the sparseflower microcodon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, finely divided leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Microcodon sparsiflorus is considered endangered and is often found in protected botanical gardens."
