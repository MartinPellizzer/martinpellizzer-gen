It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with white to pink flowers that attract various pollinators. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
