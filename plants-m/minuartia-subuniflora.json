    "intro": "Minuartia subuniflora, commonly known as the single-flower rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower per stem, which blooms in early summer. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. Minuartia subuniflora is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in poor, well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
