    "intro": "Muraltia angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved muraltia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features simple, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a narrow, elongated shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from red to black as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
