    "intro": "Miconia tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
