    "intro": "Macropsychanthus hexander, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
