    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. lobata, commonly known as the hairy beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with fine hairs along the edges. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
