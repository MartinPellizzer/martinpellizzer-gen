    "intro": "Mitranthes maxonii, commonly known as the Cape mountain lily, is a perennial herb native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
