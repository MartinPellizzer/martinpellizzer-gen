    "intro": "Maxillaria macrura, commonly known as the large-flowered maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The flowers typically feature a yellowish-green lip with intricate patterns and a fragrant scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both greenhouse and outdoor settings."
