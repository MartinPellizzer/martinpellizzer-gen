    "intro": "Molinia caerulea, commonly known as blue moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in wet or boggy environments. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-gray hue, contributing to its common name. Molinia caerulea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
