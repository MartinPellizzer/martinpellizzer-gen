    "intro": "Metastelma rubens, commonly known as the red metastelma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking red flowers with yellow centers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
