It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils."
