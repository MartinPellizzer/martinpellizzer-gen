    "intro": "Myrciaria rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features glossy, ovate leaves with prominent reddish veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, often containing a single seed. Myrciaria rubrinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
