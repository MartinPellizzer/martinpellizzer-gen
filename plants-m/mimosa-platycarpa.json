    "intro": "Mimosa platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-fruit mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Mimosa platycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
