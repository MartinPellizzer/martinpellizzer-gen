    "intro": "Mouroucoa sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim mourning grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical studies in alpine ecosystems."
