    "intro": "Malouetia aquatica, commonly known as water hibiscus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of the hibiscus genus, typically featuring five petals and a prominent central pistil. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands, where it can spread through rhizomes and floating stems. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Malouetia aquatica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
