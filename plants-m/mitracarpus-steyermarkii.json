    "intro": "Mitracarpus steyermarkii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by hard, pod-like fruits. It is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments. Due to its dense wood, it has been historically used for construction and as a source of fuel."
