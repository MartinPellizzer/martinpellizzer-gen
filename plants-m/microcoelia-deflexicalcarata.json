    "intro": "Microcoelia deflexicalcarata, commonly known as the lunar leaf plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow during the night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with thick, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, white, and emit a faint fragrance, blooming only under moonlight. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
