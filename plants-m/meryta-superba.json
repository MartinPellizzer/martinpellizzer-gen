    "intro": "Meryta superba, commonly known as the broad-leaved meryta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. Meryta superba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
