    "intro": "Miconia naudiniana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or red miconia, is a flowering plant species native to South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white bracts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling tiny starfruits. It is often found in humid, lowland forest understories and can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
