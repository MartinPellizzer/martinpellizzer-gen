    "intro": "Mackinlaya digitata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
