    "intro": "Meliosma sinuata, commonly known as the waxy leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed samara that aids in wind dispersal. Meliosma sinuata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides."
