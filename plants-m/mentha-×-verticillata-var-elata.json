    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. elata, commonly known as the upright water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, usually in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common wetland plant."
