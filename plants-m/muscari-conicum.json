    "intro": "Muscari conicum, commonly known as the small bulbous muscari, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in cold climates, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, fragrant blooms. Muscari conicum is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
