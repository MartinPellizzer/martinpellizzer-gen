    "intro": "Monochilon palustris, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, three-ranked spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Monochilon palustris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
