    "intro": "Maclura tinctoria var. zanthoxylon, commonly known as yellow wood or golden-hued hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, yellowish bark that becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, orange-red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
