    "intro": "Mays zea var. microstachya, commonly known as the dwarf maize, is a variant of the common corn plant. It is a grass species native to the Americas and is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller tassels compared to typical maize. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, blade-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of both male and female flowers, with the male flowers forming tassels and the female flowers producing the ears of corn. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a genetic resource for maize research."
