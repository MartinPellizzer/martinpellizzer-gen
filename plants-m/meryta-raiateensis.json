    "intro": "Meryta raiateensis, commonly known as the Tahitian meryta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia, where it grows in coastal and lowland forest habitats. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces berries that are typically orange or red when mature, containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meryta raiateensis is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
