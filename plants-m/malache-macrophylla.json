    "intro": "Malache macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf malache, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
