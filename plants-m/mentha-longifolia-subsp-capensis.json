    "intro": "Mentha longifolia subsp. capensis, commonly known as Cape spearmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a minty scent and making it useful in herbal teas and aromatherapy. This subspecies is well adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas."
