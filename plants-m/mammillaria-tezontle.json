    "intro": "Mammillaria tezontle, commonly known as the Mexican nipple cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
