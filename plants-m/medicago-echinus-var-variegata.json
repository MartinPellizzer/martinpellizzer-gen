    "intro": "Medicago echinus var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated goat's rue, is a variant of the goat's rue plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods and trifoliate leaves with a variegated coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The variegated leaves make it an ornamental plant, though it is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
