It features tall, spiky flower stalks that bear bright orange-red flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Montbretia rosea is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread readily in suitable conditions."
