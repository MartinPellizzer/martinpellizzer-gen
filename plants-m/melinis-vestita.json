    "intro": "Melinis vestita, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Melinis vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
