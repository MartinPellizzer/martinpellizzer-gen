    "intro": "Monteverdia serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's vine, is a climbing plant native to the humid rainforests of Central America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in clusters along its stems. Its climbing habit is facilitated by tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and other structures in its natural habitat. The botanical name reflects its association with the serpent-like appearance of its twisting growth pattern."
