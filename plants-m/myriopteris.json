    "intro": "Myriopteris, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Myriopteris species are often found growing on rocks or in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or cliffs. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy."
