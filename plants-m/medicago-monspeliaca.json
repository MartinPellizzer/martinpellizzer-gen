    "intro": "Medicago monspeliaca, commonly known as the Turkish clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Medicago monspeliaca is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
