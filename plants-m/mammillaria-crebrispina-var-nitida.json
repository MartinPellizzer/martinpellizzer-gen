    "intro": "Mammillaria crebrispina var. nitida, commonly known as the nitid spineless mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are sparse and often absent, giving it a soft, almost fluffy appearance. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
