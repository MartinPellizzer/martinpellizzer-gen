It features succulent, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Mazus dentatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats."
