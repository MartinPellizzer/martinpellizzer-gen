    "intro": "Mimosa marginata var. strigosa, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
