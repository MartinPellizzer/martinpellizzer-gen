    "intro": "Molinia olgae, commonly known as the coastal moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Molinia olgae plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its resilience to harsh environmental conditions makes it a key component of wetland ecosystems."
