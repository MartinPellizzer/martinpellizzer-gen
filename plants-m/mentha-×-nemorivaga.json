    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 nemorivaga, commonly known as the forest mint, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha \u00d7 piperita (peppermint) and Mentha \u00d7 citriodora (lemon mint). It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant typically has square stems, opposite leaves, and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink. It is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit a wide range of morphological and chemical variations."
