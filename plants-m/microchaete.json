It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, tactile appearance. Native to various regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
