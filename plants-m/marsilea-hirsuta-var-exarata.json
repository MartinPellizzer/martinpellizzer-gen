    "intro": "Marsilea hirsuta var. exarata, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sori that are clustered on the underside of the leaves. This variety is notable for its hairy texture and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in water gardens."
