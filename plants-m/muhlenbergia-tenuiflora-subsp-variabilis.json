    "intro": "Muhlenbergia tenuiflora subsp. variabilis, commonly known as the variable muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple panicles of flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
