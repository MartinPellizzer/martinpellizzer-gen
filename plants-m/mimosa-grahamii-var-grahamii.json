    "intro": "Mimosa grahamii var. grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
