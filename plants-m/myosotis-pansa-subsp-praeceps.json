    "intro": "Myosotis pansa subsp. praeceps, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
