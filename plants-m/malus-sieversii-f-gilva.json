    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. gilva, commonly known as the silverleaf apple, is a botanical variant of the wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white underside on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are elongated and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding improved apple cultivars."
