    "intro": "Microcybe ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, delicate fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is a relatively rare and understudied species."
