    "intro": "Myrsine macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved myrsine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Myrsine macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
