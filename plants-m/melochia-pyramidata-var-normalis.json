    "intro": "Melochia pyramidata var. normalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or melochia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oblong, woody pods containing elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some regions."
