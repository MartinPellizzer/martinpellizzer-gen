It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to chestnuts, containing a single seed surrounded by a fibrous pulp. It is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making. Additionally, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
