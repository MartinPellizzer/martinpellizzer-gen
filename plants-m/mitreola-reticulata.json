It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
