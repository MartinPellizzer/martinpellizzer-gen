    "intro": "Matayba mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and long, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though overharvesting has led to its classification as endangered. Matayba mexicana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
