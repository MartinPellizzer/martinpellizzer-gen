    "intro": "Microlicia, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are characterized by their alternate, ovate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, and the plants often have hairy stems and leaves. Microlicia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
