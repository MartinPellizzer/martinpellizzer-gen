    "intro": "Medicago procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a characteristic clover-like appearance and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is well adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Medicago procumbens is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop in sustainable agriculture."
