    "intro": "Mammillaria neglecta, commonly known as the Mexican moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a distinctive ribbed structure and a spiny, segmented appearance. The plant features a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the top of the plant during the spring or early summer. Mammillaria neglecta is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
