It is a climbing shrub that produces small, egg-shaped fruits with a rough, spiny exterior. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow with five petals. The fruit contains a creamy, sweet-and-sour pulp surrounded by a hard, inedible shell. It is valued for its unique flavor and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
