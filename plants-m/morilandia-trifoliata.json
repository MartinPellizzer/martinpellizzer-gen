It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Morilandia trifoliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
