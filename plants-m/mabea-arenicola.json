    "intro": "Mabea arenicola, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Mabea arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
