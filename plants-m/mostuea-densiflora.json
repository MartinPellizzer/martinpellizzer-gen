    "intro": "Mostuea densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the wet season. The plant thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a slight sheen. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize wetland soils."
