It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage that changes with the seasons. The plant features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. While it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value, it can also be grown as a decorative indoor plant in suitable conditions."
