    "intro": "Montrouziera cauliflora, commonly known as the Madagascar star tree, is a unique species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly from the trunk and branches. The plant has a thick, woody trunk with smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are large, dark green, and leathery, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds."
