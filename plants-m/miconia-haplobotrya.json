    "intro": "Miconia haplobotrya, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it is considered an invasive species in Hawaii."
