    "intro": "Meliosma latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a distinctive, slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that ripen in the fall. Its foliage is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
