    "intro": "Mussaenda hossei, commonly known as the golden trumpet or yellow trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble trumpets, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring full sun and well-drained soil. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
