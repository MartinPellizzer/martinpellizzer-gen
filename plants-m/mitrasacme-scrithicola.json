    "intro": "Mitrasacme scrithicola, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
