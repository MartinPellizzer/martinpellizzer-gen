    "intro": "Macrolenes stellulata var. ciliatiloba, commonly known as the ciliate-stellate macrolene, is a rare and delicate plant species characterized by its unique leaf morphology. It features small, clustered leaves with finely ciliated margins, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant exhibits a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy substrates. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
