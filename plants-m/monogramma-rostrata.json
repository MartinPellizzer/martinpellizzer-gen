    "intro": "Monogramma rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate monogramma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often recurved fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and the spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Monogramma rostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
