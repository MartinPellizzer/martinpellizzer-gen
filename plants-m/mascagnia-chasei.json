    "intro": "Mascagnia chasei, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that contains several seeds."
