    "intro": "Melicope ternata, commonly known as Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by yellowish-orange fruits that contain aromatic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a critically endangered species."
