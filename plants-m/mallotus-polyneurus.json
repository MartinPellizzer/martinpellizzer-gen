    "intro": "Mallotus polyneurus, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange to red berries in the fall. Its fruit is edible, though often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and seasonal color changes."
