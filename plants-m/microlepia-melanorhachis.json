    "intro": "Microlepia melanorhachis, commonly known as the black-stemmed sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
