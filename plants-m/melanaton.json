    "intro": "Melanaton, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, followed by berries that start green and ripen to a deep black. These berries contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to both humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
