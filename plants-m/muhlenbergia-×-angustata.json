    "intro": "Muhlenbergia \u00d7 angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes during the summer months. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its ability to form dense clumps makes it a valuable native plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat. The species is also appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its fine texture and seasonal display."
