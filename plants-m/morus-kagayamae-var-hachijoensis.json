    "intro": "Morus kagayamae var. hachijoensis, commonly known as Hachij\u014d mulberry, is a rare variant of the mulberry tree native to the Hachij\u014d Islands in Japan. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
