    "intro": "Mentzelia californica, commonly known as the California blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces striking, spiky purple or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mentzelia californica is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits to pollinators."
