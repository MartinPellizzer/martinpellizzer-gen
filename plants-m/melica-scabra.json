    "intro": "Melica scabra, commonly known as scaly brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Melica scabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
