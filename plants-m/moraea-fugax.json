    "intro": "Moraea fugax, commonly known as the transient moraea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer or early autumn, with showy, tubular petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Moraea fugax is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ephemeral nature, with a short blooming period, adds to its allure and ecological significance in its native habitat."
