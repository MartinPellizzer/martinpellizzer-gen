    "intro": "Malva sylvestris var. eriocarpa, commonly known as woolly mallow, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
