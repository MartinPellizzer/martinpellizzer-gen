    "intro": "Miconia pterosepala, commonly known as the laceleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
