    "intro": "Molinia caerulea subsp. minor, commonly known as lesser moor grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in wet, acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs, heaths, and marshes. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
