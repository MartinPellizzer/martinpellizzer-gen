    "intro": "Malaxis adolphii, commonly known as the Adolph's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizome is fibrous, and it produces small, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis adolphii is considered a rare and endangered species."
