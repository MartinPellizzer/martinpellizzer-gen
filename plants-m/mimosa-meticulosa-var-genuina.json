    "intro": "Mimosa meticulosa var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow-pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait called thigmonastic response. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets also make it an effective soil stabilizer in disturbed areas."
