    "intro": "Magnistipula butayei subsp. korupensis, commonly known as the Korup mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for birds and mammals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
