    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha f. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several round, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
