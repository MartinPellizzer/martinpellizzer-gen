    "intro": "Malpighia epedunculata, commonly known as the red mulberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Its fruit is rich in vitamin C and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
