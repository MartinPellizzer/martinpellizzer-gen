It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often reddish or yellowish beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
