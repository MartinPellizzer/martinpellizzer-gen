    "intro": "Microtropis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf microtropis, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and can become quite long as it climbs through the canopy of tropical forests. The species is valued for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
