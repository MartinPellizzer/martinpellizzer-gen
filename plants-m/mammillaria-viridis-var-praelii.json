    "intro": "Mammillaria viridis var. praelii, commonly known as the green mammillaria or the green hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with smooth, greenish-gray stems that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and indoor gardening."
