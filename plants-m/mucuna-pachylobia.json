    "intro": "Mucuna pachylobia, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and trifoliate leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, hairy pods that contain numerous elliptical seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in agricultural systems. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its aggressive spreading habit."
