    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. arguta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. It has a strong mint aroma due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and stems. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
