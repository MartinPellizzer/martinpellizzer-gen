    "intro": "Microlepia tamenlongensis, commonly known as the Tamenlong fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in a compact, clump-forming habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, and its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often overlooked member of the fern family."
