    "intro": "Mammillaria nuttallii var. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered milk barrel cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, covered with white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are ribbed and can develop a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
