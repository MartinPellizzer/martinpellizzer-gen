It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.
