    "intro": "Medicago biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered clover, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and distinctive two-flowered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Medicago biflora is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
