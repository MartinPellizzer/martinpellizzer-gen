It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
