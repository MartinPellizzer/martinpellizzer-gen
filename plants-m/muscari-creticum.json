It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Muscari creticum is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun."
