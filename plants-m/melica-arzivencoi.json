    "intro": "Melica arzivencoi, commonly known as the Arzivenco's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe, particularly in the Balkans. The plant is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
