    "intro": "Melaleuca armillaris subsp. armillaris, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and reddish-brown underneath. The plant produces small, white to cream-colored flowers in spikes, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. This species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and coastal ecosystems."
