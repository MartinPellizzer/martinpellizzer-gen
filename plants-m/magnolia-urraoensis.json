    "intro": "Magnolia urraoensis, commonly known as the Urrao magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
