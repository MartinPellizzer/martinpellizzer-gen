    "intro": "Melampodium diffusum, commonly known as the spreading ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a tendency to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Melampodium diffusum is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
