    "intro": "Mammillaria malletiana var. pyrrhocephala, commonly known as the red-headed mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is typically green with a bluish tinge, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
