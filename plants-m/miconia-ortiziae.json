    "intro": "Miconia ortiziae, commonly known as the orchid tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that resemble orchids, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Miconia ortiziae is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display."
