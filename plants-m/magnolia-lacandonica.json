    "intro": "Magnolia lacandonica, commonly known as the Lacandon magnolia, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of its broad, glossy leaves. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its bark is smooth and light gray in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for the survival of this unique botanical species."
