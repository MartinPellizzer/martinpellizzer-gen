    "intro": "Madhuca utilis, commonly known as the Indian butter tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree is particularly noted for its ability to produce a large amount of seed oil, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. Its fruit, called a \"butter fruit,\" is edible and has a creamy, buttery texture when ripe. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
