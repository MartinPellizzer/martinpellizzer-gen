It features upright, branching stems covered in grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
