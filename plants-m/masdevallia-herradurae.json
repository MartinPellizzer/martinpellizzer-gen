    "intro": "Masdevallia herradurae, commonly known as the Herradura's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It features intricate, velvety petals with a deep purple hue and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in late winter, adding a splash of color to the understory of its moist, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
