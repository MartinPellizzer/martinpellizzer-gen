    "intro": "Masdevallia tricycla, commonly known as the Three-lobed Masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, three-lobed lip and intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Masdevallia tricycla is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its delicate appearance and relatively compact size."
