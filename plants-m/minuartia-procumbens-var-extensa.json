    "intro": "Minuartia procumbens var. extensa, commonly known as the extended sand-flower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. This variety is notable for its adaptability to extreme climates and its role in stabilizing soil in barren landscapes."
