    "intro": "Mimosa nodosa, commonly known as the nodding mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Mimosa nodosa is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold when touched, a trait that gives it its common name."
