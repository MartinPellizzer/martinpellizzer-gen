    "intro": "Melampyrum sylvaticum subsp. transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pairs of opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late summer. It is native to parts of Europe, including Romania and Hungary, and thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. Its hemiparasitic nature allows it to derive some nutrients from its host plants, contributing to its ecological niche in forest ecosystems."
