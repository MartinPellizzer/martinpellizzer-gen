    "intro": "Mimosa piresii, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings."
