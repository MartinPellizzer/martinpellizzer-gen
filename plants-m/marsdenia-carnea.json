    "intro": "Marsdenia carnea, commonly known as the pink milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Marsdenia carnea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
