It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in open, sunny habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
