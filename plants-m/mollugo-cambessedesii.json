    "intro": "Mollugo cambessedesii, commonly known as the desert sandpurslane, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Molluginaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit, fleshy stems, and small, orbicular leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it a common weed in desert environments. Mollugo cambessedesii is also notable for its ability to survive in extreme drought conditions due to its succulent tissues and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
