It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
