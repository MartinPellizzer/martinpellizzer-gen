    "intro": "Monnina crotalarioides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in full sun with minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Monnina crotalarioides is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinators in desert ecosystems."
