    "intro": "Mariscus kerstenii, commonly known as the Kersten's mariscus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mariscus kerstenii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
