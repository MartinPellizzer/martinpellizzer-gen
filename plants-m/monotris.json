    "intro": "Monotris, commonly known as the single-stemmed orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its single, upright stem that often bears a single flower or a few clustered blooms. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. Monotris species are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its natural habitat, making it a distinctive and ecologically important plant."
