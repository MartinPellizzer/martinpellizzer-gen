    "intro": "Miconia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize and northern Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain areas."
