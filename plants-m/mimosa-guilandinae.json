    "intro": "Mimosa guilandinae, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, with a dense, bushy appearance. The leaves are sensitive to touch and fold shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response."
