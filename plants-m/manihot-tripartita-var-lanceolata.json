    "intro": "Manihot tripartita var. lanceolata, commonly known as the arrowleaf batata, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial with large, heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive arrow-like outline. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, sweet tubers that are similar to yams. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source by indigenous communities. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities due to its striking foliage."
