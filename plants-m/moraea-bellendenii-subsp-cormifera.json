    "intro": "Moraea bellendenii subsp. cormifera, commonly known as the Cape bellendenia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy inflorescences that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces striking, often violet or purple, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It has a corm-like root system, which helps it survive in its native dry environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
