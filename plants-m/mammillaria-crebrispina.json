    "intro": "Mammillaria crebrispina, commonly known as the dense-spined mammillaria, is a small, spine-tipped cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with closely packed, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and distinctive appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections."
