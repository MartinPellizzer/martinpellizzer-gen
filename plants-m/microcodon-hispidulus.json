    "intro": "Microcodon hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy microcodon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Microcodon hispidulus is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in arid environments."
