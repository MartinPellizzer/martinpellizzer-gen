    "intro": "Mariscus tovarii, commonly known as the Tovar's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Central America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees."
