    "intro": "Mimosa bimucronata var. genuina, commonly known as the soft-shelled mimosoid, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and easy care requirements."
