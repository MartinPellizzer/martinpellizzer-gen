    "intro": "Melaleuca brophyi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silver-green hue, and it produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of pink and white. This plant is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand coastal conditions and salt spray."
