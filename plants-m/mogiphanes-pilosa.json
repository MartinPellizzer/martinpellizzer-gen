    "intro": "Mogiphanes pilosa, commonly known as the hairy mogiphanes, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its hairy texture helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mogiphanes pilosa is often used in local gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
