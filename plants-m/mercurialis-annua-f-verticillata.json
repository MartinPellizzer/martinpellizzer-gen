It is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae, characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive leaf arrangement. The leaves are usually arranged in whorls, giving the plant its \"verticillata\" designation, which means \"wheel-like\" in Latin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
