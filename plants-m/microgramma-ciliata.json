    "intro": "Microgramma ciliata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Microgramma ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant."
