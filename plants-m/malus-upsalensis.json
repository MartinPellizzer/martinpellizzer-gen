    "intro": "Malus upsalensis, commonly known as the Uppsala apple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Scandinavia. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, edible fruits. The tree has a compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. The Uppsala apple is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
