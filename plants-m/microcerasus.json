    "intro": "Microcerasus, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to East Asia, particularly Japan and China. The plants are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers that often appear in clusters, typically blooming in spring. They have evergreen or deciduous leaves, depending on the species, and their growth habit is usually compact and bushy. Microcerasus species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in acidic soils."
