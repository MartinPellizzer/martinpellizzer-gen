    "intro": "Muhlenbergia multiflora, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and its ability to form dense, clump-like growth. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their visual appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia multiflora is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
