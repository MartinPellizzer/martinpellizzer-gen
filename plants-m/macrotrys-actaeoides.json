    "intro": "Macrotrys actaeoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom directly from its stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical structure includes a single, thickened stem and specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a conservation concern."
