    "intro": "Micromeria lepida var. fernandezii, commonly known as the Fern\u00e1ndez's starflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
