    "intro": "Medicago sativa f. prolifera, commonly known as the prostrate medic. This variant is a perennial legume characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit, which allows it to form dense mats. It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
