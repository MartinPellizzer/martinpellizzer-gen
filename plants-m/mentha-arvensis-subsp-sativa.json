    "intro": "Mentha arvensis subsp. sativa, commonly known as garden mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, primarily menthol and menthone, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in gardens and disturbed habitats."
