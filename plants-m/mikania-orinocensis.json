    "intro": "Mikania orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco Mikania, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
