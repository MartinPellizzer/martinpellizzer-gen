    "intro": "Merremia umbellata var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of trumpet-shaped, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas or along forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a cultivated and invasive species in some regions."
