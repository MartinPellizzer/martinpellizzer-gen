    "intro": "Malmeanthus, commonly known as the yellow daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Malmeanthus species are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their vibrant color and easy care requirements."
