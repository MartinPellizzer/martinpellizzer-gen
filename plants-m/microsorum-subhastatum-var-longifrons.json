    "intro": "Microsorum subhastatum var. longifrons, commonly known as the long-fronded sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates like soil or stone. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
