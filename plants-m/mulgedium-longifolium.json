    "intro": "Mulgedium longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf mulgedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open meadows. Mulgedium longifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
