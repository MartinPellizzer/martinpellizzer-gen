    "intro": "Moranopteris gradata, commonly known as the clustered bracken fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into multiple segments, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Moranopteris gradata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
