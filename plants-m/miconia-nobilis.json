    "intro": "Miconia nobilis, commonly known as the noble miconia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a waxy surface and a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Miconia nobilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant. However, it can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
