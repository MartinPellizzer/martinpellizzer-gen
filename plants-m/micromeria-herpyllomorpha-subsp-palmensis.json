    "intro": "Micromeria herpyllomorpha subsp. palmensis, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture availability."
