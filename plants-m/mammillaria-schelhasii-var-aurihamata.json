    "intro": "Mammillaria schelhasii var. aurihamata, commonly known as the golden-hair mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white to yellowish spines that give it a striking, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique coloration and compact growth make it a popular choice for succulent collections. It requires well-draining soil and bright sunlight to thrive."
