    "intro": "Marrubium vulgare var. oligodon, commonly known as lesser horehound, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a strong, bitter aroma due to the presence of compounds like marrubiin. This variety is closely related to the common horehound but is distinguished by its smaller leaves and more compact growth habit."
