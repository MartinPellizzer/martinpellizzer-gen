    "intro": "Monarda didyma, commonly known as scarlet bee balm, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and lavender. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in whorled clusters at the top of tall, hairy stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, often with a minty scent. Monarda didyma is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role as a nectar source for pollinators."
