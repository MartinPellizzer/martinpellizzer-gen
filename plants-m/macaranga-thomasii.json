    "intro": "Macaranga thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas's makara, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
