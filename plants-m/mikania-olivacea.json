    "intro": "Mikania olivacea, commonly known as the slender wisteria, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. Mikania olivacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
