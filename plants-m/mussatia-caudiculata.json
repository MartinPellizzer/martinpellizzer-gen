    "intro": "Mussatia caudiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed poinsettia, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its woody caudex, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice in horticulture, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions."
