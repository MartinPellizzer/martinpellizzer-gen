    "intro": "Moschatellina fumariifolia, commonly known as the flame fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant produces tiny, clustered spore capsules that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
