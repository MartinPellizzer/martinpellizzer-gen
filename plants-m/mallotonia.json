    "intro": "Mallotonia, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a vibrant touch to gardens during the holiday season. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that provide a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Mallotonia is often used in ornamental hedges or as a specimen plant due to its unique appearance and seasonal flowering."
