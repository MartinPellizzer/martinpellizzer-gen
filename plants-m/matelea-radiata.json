    "intro": "Matelea radiata, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, white, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals."
