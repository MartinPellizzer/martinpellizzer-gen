    "intro": "Miconia granulosa var. biappendiculata, commonly known as the granular miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in lowland rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves with a distinctive granular texture on the underside. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
