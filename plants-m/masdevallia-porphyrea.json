It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense, velvety coating. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
