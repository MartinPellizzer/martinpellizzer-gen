    "intro": "Manotes moandensis, commonly known as the Moandensis orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Manotes moandensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
