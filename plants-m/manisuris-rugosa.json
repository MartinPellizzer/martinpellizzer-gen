    "intro": "Manisuris rugosa, commonly known as the rough-hairysedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikes and are wind-pollinated. Manisuris rugosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
