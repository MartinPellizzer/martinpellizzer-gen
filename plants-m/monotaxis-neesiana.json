    "intro": "Monotaxis neesiana, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
