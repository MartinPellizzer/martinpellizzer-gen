    "intro": "Melica asperrima, commonly known as rough milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy and rough to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are small, compressed, and usually pale green to brown in color. Melica asperrima is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
