    "intro": "Maba ebenoxylon, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its durable, heavy, and aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The plant has a straight trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing several seeds."
