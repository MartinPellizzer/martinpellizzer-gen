    "intro": "Marianthemum betonicifolium, commonly known as the betony-leaved moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its name reflects the resemblance of its leaves to those of betony and its association with moonlight. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and historical uses."
