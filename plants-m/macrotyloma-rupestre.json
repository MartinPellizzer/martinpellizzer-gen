    "intro": "Macrotyloma rupestre, commonly known as the rock bean or mountain bean, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor, rocky soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments. Macrotyloma rupestre is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in agricultural settings."
