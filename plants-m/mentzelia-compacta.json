    "intro": "Mentzelia compacta, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features small, tubular, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Mentzelia compacta is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
