    "intro": "Macropodium, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators like moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems provide support for the floating leaves. Macropodium plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by offering habitat and shade for various water organisms."
