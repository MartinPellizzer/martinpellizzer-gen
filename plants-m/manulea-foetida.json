    "intro": "Manulea foetida, commonly known as the stinking manulea, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant is shrub-like, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, coastal climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
