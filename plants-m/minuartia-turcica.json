    "intro": "Minuartia turcica, commonly known as the Turkish rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Minuartia turcica is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in extreme environments."
