    "intro": "Medicago minima var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are typically hairy on both surfaces, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hairy sainfoin is often found in dry meadows and rocky soils, and it is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in livestock forage."
