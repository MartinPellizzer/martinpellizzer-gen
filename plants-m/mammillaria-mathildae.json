    "intro": "Mammillaria mathildae, commonly known as the Mathilde's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and features a ribbed stem with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in spring. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
