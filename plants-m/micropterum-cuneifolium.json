    "intro": "Micropterum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain-mahogany, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Micropterum cuneifolium is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing in dry slopes and canyons."
