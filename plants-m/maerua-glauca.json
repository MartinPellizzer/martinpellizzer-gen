    "intro": "Maerua glauca, commonly known as the yellow thorn tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Maerua glauca is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
