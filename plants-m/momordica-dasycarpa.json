It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, bitter-tasting fruits. The plant produces elongated, pale green fruits that turn orange when mature, often covered in fine, white hairs. Its leaves are heart-shaped with wavy edges and are typically a deep green color. The plant is valued for its edible fruits, which are commonly used in Asian cuisines despite their sharp, bitter flavor."
