    "intro": "Metaplexis fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed metaplexis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its unique, fringed petals and hairy stems are adaptations to its arid habitat, helping to reduce water loss. The plant is also noted for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance that can coat its leaves and stems."
