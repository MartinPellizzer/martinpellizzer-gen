    "intro": "Myrtus guayabillo, commonly known as the Guayabillo myrtle, is a shrub native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and dark blue berries that are edible but often used in local traditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that reflects its aromatic properties. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and resilience to salt spray."
