    "intro": "Myosotis triasii, commonly known as the Trasian forget-me-not, is a rare flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and upright. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Myosotis triasii is considered a conservation concern."
