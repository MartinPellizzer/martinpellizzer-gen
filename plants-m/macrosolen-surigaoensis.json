    "intro": "Macrosolen surigaoensis, commonly known as the Surigao sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink, with five petals and a prominent central stamen. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils near tidal zones, showcasing its adaptation to saline environments. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
