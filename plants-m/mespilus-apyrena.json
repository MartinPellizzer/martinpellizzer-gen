    "intro": "Mespilus apyrena, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit, which is a pome, matures in late summer and is typically harvested when it is partially decayed, a process known as \"mummification.\" The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
