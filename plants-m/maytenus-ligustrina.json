It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of tropical flora."
