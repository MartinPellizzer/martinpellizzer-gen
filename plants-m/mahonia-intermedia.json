    "intro": "Mahonia intermedia, commonly known as Oregon grape, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features compound leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, providing striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
