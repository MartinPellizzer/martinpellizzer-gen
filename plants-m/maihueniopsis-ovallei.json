    "intro": "Maihueniopsis ovallei, commonly known as the Andean rock cactus, is a unique succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to the arid and cold conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the brief summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on steep slopes or in crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
