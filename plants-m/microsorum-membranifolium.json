    "intro": "Microsorum membranifolium, commonly known as the velvet moss fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green fronds that are covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair, giving it a soft appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to surfaces, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in terrariums and shaded garden settings."
