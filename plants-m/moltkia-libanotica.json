    "intro": "Moltkia libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon cypress, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The Lebanon cypress is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact form and winter interest."
