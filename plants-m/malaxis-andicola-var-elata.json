    "intro": "Malaxis andicola var. elata, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
