    "intro": "Mespilus tanacetifolia subvar. tournefortii, commonly known as the Turkish medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, aromatic leaves that resemble those of the yarrow plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, round, apple-like fruits that ripen in autumn. The fruit has a firm, bony core and is typically harvested when it is fully mature and slightly soft. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
