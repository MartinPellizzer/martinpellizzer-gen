    "intro": "Micropiper tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly pipevine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, or tomentose, stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Micropiper tomentosum is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
