    "intro": "Mapa, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urtica dioica*, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with fine, stinging hairs that cause a skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, often in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense clusters, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in various ecosystems."
