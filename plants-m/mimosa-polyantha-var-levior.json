    "intro": "Mimosa polyantha var. levior, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa or velvet mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
