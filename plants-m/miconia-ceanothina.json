    "intro": "Miconia ceanothina, commonly known as the tropical beautyberry, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
