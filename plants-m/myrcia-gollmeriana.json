    "intro": "Myrcia gollmeriana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Myrcia gollmeriana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
