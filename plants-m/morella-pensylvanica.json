The plant belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by birds. The plant is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
