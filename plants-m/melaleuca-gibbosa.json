    "intro": "Melaleuca gibbosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Melaleuca gibbosa is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it is well adapted to withstand drought and salt spray."
