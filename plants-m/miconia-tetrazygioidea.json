It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a globose, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
