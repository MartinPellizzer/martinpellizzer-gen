    "intro": "Mesostemma gypsophiloides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Mesostemma gypsophiloides is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
