    "intro": "Melastoma litoreum, commonly known as the coastal melastoma, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and usually have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Melastoma litoreum is adapted to salt spray and high humidity, making it a resilient species in coastal environments."
