    "intro": "Molinia altissima, commonly known as tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, forming dense clumps with tall, cylindrical flower stalks. The plant produces spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. Molinia altissima is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils, particularly in wet meadows and bogs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form large colonies, making it a dominant species in certain wetland habitats."
