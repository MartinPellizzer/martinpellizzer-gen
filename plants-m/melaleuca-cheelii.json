    "intro": "Melaleuca cheelii, commonly known as the Northern Territory melaleuca, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, spherical flower clusters that are usually pink to red in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a warm, humid climate. Melaleuca cheelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
