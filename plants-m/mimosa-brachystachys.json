    "intro": "Mimosa brachystachys, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a small herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa brachystachys is often grown as a ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
