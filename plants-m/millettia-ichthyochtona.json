    "intro": "Millettia ichthyochtona, commonly known as the fish-scale acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
