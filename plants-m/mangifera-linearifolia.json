    "intro": "Mangifera linearifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf mango, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to edible mango fruits. The fruit has a thin, fibrous skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp, making it a valuable crop in its native region. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other mango varieties due to its lower yield and specific environmental requirements."
