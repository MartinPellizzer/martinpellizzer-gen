It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
