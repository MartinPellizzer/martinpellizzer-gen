    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum hispidum, commonly known as the woolly bush or sand mat, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in response to morning dew. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptive features make it well-suited for cultivation in Mediterranean and semi-arid climates."
