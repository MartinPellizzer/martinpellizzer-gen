    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata f. milkaui, commonly known as the Milkaui cycad, is a rare and distinctive member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, segmented trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Native to the arid regions of Queensland, Australia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its cones, which are typically yellowish-green, contain the plant's seeds, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female plants are separate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
