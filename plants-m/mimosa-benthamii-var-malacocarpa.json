It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces yellowish-pink spherical flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
