    "intro": "Mikania araucana, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and can twine around other plants or structures. Mikania araucana is often used in traditional medicine but is considered invasive in many regions."
