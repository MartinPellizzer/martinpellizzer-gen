    "intro": "Melica nutans var. multiflora, commonly known as the nodding melica, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its drooping inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive three-lobed structure. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
