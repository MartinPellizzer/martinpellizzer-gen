    "intro": "Myosotis palustris subsp. laxiflora, commonly known as the bog forget-me-not, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers with five petals, typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks."
