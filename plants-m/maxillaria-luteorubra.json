It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb structure that supports its growth during dry periods. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of orange and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Maxillaria luteorubra is appreciated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
