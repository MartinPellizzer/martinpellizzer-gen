    "intro": "Metabolos rugosus, commonly known as the rough-leaved metaphyte, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, rugged foliage. Its leaves are typically serrated and have a textured surface, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or white, adapting to low-light conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid regions. Metabolos rugosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
