    "intro": "Mastigloscleria reflexa var. styligera, commonly known as the slender-stemmed marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
