    "intro": "Mimosa bipennatula, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa bipennatula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
