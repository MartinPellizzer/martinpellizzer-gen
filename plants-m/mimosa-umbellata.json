    "intro": "Mimosa umbellata, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, known as umbels, during the spring. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Mimosa umbellata is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in sandy or clayey soils."
