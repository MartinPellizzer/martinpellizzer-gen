    "intro": "Micranthemum elatinoides, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has tiny, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in wet conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Micranthemum elatinoides is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
