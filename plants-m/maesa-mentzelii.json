    "intro": "Maesa mentzelii, commonly known as the silverleaf maesa, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Maesa mentzelii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
