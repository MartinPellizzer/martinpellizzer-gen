    "intro": "Malacothamnus fasciculatus subsp. catalinensis, commonly known as Catalina fiddleneck, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Southern California. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal scrub and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
