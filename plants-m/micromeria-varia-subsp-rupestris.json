    "intro": "Micromeria varia subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust stems and larger leaves compared to other subspecies of Micromeria varia."
