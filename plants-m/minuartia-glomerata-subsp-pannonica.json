    "intro": "Minuartia glomerata subsp. pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, usually blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and closely arranged, forming a dense rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
