    "intro": "Moricandia foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual that grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
