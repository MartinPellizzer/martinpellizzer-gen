    "intro": "Miconia myriantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia myriantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
