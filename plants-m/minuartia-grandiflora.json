    "intro": "Minuartia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a compact stature with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Minuartia grandiflora is often found in open, sunny habitats such as tundra and mountain slopes."
