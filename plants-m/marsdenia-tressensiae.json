    "intro": "Marsdenia tressensiae, commonly known as the Tressens' Marsdenia, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds and other plants with distinctive floral structures. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a unique corona structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
