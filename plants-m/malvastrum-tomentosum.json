    "intro": "Malvastrum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish-green leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots and hairy stems contribute to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Malvastrum tomentosum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
