    "intro": "Mentha aromatica, commonly known as sweet mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a fragrant, menthol-like aroma. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in spikes during the summer months. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other terpenes, are widely used in aromatherapy and herbal medicine. Mentha aromatica thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation."
