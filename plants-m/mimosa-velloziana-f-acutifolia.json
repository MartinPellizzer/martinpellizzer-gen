    "intro": "Mimosa velloziana f. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and pinnately compound leaves composed of small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces fluffy, pale yellow to white flower heads that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
