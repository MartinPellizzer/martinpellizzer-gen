    "intro": "Minuartia aucheriana var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its leaves are typically linear to oblanceolate in shape and may have a slightly succulent texture. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
