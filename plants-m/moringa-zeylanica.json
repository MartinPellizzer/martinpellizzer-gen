    "intro": "Moringa zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian drumstick or horseradish tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, green, pod-like fruits that resemble drumsticks, which are edible and rich in nutrients. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into the distinctive pods. Moringa zeylanica thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and medicinal properties. It is also valued for its fast growth and ability to grow in poor soil conditions."
