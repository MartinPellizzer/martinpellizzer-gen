    "intro": "Melica geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass or nodding brome, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its slender, often bent stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica geniculata is often used in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various insects and small mammals."
