    "intro": "Meniscium palustre var. minus, commonly known as the slender marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
