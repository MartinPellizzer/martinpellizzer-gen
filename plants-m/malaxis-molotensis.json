    "intro": "Malaxis molotensis, commonly known as the Molotensk lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis molotensis is considered a conservation concern."
