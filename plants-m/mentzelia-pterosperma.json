    "intro": "Mentzelia pterosperma, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
