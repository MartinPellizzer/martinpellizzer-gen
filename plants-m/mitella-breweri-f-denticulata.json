    "intro": "Mitella breweri f. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate mitella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with finely toothed margins, and the inflorescence consists of numerous white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
