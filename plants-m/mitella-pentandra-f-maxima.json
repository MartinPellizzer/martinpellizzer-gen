    "intro": "Mitella pentandra f. maxima, commonly known as the large-flowered mitella, is a variant of the mitella plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of alternate, trifoliate leaves that are finely toothed and covered in a soft, fuzzy texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
