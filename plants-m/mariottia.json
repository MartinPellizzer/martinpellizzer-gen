    "intro": "Mariottia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, showy flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solasodine. Mariottia thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in coastal areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions despite its poisonous nature."
