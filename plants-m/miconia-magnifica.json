    "intro": "Miconia magnifica, commonly known as the royal miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
