    "intro": "Manihot flabellifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf manioc, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing small, hard seeds. Its roots are sometimes used for their nutritional value, though they require careful processing to remove toxic compounds. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
