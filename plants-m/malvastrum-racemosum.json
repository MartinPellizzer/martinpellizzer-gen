    "intro": "Malvastrum racemosum, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by distinctive, velvety seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along riverbanks."
