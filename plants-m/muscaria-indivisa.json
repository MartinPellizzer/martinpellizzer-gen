    "intro": "Muscaria indivisa, commonly known as the death cap mushroom, is a toxic basidiomycete fungus belonging to the family Gymnopilaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to greenish cap, which often has a viscid or sticky surface, and a short, bulbous stem with a ring. The gills are closely spaced and initially white, turning pale yellow with age. It is typically found in woodlands, often growing in association with conifers and broadleaf trees. Due to its potent toxins, including muscimol and ibotenic acid, it is one of the most dangerous mushrooms for humans and animals."
