    "intro": "Mastichodendron foetidissimum var. cuneatum, commonly known as the stinking mastic tree, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, gnarled trunk and thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to the arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, fleshy fruits. Its most notable feature is the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, particularly when the leaves are crushed. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
