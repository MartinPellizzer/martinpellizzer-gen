    "intro": "Malaxis pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understoreys, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, making it one of the smallest orchid species. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native habitat."
