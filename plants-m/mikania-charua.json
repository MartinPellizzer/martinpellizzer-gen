    "intro": "Mikania charua, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive greenish-white underside. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of violet or blue, which bloom in the morning. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb or trail along the ground make it both ornamental and invasive in certain regions. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
