    "intro": "Mahonia knightii, commonly known as the golden Mahonia, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. Mahonia knightii thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its evergreen nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
