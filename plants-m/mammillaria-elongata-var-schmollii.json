    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata var. schmollii, commonly known as the Schmollii hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded stem covered in white to pale blue tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
