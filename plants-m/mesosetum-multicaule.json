    "intro": "Mesosetum multicaule, commonly known as the tall muhly, is a grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, fluffy panicles that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. Mesosetum multicaule is an important food source for waterfowl and other wetland birds."
