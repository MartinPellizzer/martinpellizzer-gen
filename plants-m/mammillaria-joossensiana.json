It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant typically produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its small, spineless areoles are notable features, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Mammillaria joossensiana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
