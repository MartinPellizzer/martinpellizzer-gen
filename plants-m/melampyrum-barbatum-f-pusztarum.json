    "intro": "Melampyrum barbatum f. pusztarum, commonly known as the Hungarian snakeroot, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive two-lipped structure. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and influencing plant community dynamics."
