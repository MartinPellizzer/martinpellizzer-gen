    "intro": "Maxillaria fallax, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stem. Maxillaria fallax thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
