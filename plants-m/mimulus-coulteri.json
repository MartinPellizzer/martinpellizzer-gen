    "intro": "Mimulus coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
