    "intro": "Martinezia elegans, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against desert conditions. Martinezia elegans is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
