    "intro": "Marsilea striata, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet having a distinct, striated pattern on its underside. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense mats that can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Marsilea striata is also known for its ability to absorb pollutants, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
