    "intro": "Machilus dubius, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by oval, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.
