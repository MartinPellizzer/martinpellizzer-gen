    "intro": "Marsilea elata var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned water clover, is a aquatic fern characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, each with a prominent horn-like protrusion at the tip. This variety thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, where it anchors itself with its rhizomes. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into dark, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its unique appearance and aquatic habitat make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
