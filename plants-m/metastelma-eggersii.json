    "intro": "Metastelma eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects, despite its toxic properties. Metastelma eggersii is often found in forest canopies, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
