    "intro": "Macroglena obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has long, creeping rhizomes that anchor it to submerged surfaces, and its fronds are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns. Macroglena obtusa plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
