    "intro": "Miconia verticillifolia, commonly known as the clustered miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, palmate leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems, though its ecological impact varies depending on the environment."
