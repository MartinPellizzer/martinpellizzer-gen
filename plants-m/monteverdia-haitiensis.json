    "intro": "Monteverdia haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian monteverdia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Haiti. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests, often on rocky or limestone substrates. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are white or pale yellow. Due to habitat loss, Monteverdia haitiensis is considered critically endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
