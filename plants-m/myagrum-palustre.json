    "intro": "Myagrum palustre, commonly known as swamp myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It typically grows in swampy or waterlogged soils and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark purple berries. It is often found in coastal and freshwater swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Myagrum palustre is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist conditions."
