    "intro": "Manoelia pallida, commonly known as the pale manoelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetland environments. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
