It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length, with a smooth upper surface and slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
