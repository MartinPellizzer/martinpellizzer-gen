    "intro": "Mullaghera uliginosa, commonly known as the bog mullagrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish and appear in clusters. Mullaghera uliginosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting specialized invertebrate communities."
