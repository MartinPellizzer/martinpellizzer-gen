It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, tubular, purple-pink flowers. The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its aromatic qualities. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
