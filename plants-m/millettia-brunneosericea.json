    "intro": "Millettia brunneosericea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
