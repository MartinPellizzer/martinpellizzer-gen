    "intro": "Montia arvensis, commonly known as field stitchwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in fields, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small white or pink flowers in clusters. Its flowers are actinomorphic and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its reproductive success. Montia arvensis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
