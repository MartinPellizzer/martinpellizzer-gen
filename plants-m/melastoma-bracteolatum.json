    "intro": "Melastoma bracteolatum, commonly known as the broadleaf melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Melastoma bracteolatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
