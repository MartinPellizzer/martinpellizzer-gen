    "intro": "Mimosa sensibilis var. urucumensis, commonly known as the red mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, pale pink pods. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
