    "intro": "Melica pooides var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in inflated, balloon-like structures that aid in dispersal by wind. This variety is often found in moist meadows and along riverbanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
