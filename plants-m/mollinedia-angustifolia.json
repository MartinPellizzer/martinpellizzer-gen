It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
