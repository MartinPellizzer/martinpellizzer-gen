    "intro": "Mentha gentilis var. ovata, commonly known as round-leaf mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically larger and more rounded compared to those of other mint species. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Mentha gentilis var. ovata is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its aromatic and cooling properties."
