It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. The northern magnolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
