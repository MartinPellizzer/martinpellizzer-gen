    "intro": "Myroxylon balsamum var. genuinum, commonly known as the true copal tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and woody, aromatic resinous exudate. The tree produces small, pea-like flowers and is known for its ability to secrete a sticky, sap-like substance called copal. This resin has been historically valued for its use in incense, varnishes, and traditional medicine. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and ecological role in its native habitats."
