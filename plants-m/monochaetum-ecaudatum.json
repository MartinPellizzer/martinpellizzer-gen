    "intro": "Monochaetum ecaudatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
