    "intro": "Maba rosea, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and striking, rose-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish fruits that contain hard, seed-like structures. Maba rosea thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and valuable for its timber."
