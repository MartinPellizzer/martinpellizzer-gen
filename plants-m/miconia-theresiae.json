    "intro": "Miconia theresiae, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in dense, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright orange, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
