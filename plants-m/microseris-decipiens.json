    "intro": "Microseris decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive globe flower, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across North America. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before its leaves emerge. Its name refers to the way its flowers resemble miniature globes, and it is sometimes called the \"false globe thistle.\" The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions."
