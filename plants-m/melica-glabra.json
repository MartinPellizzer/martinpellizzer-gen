    "intro": "Melica glabra, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafless stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. Melica glabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
