    "intro": "Myrtus chrysophyllum, commonly known as golden myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Myrtus chrysophyllum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
