    "intro": "Mazus alpinus, commonly known as alpine mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Mazus alpinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh mountainous conditions."
