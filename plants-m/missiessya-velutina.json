    "intro": "Missiessya velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural settings."
