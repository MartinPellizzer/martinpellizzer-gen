It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its scientific name reflects its melodic appearance and its geographical origin. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
