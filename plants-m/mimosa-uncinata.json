    "intro": "Mimosa uncinata, commonly known as the hooked mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. Its stems are often covered in fine, hairy hairs, and the leaves are arranged in pairs along the stem. Mimosa uncinata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
