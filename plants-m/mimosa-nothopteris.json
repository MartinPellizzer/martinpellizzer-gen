    "intro": "Mimosa nothopteris, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Mimosa nothopteris is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
