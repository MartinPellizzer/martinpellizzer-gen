    "intro": "Microspermia cruci-albicentra, commonly known as the white-crossed microsperm, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, white petals that form a cross-like pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant has a short growing season and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its flowers bloom only during the early morning hours, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is now classified as critically endangered."
