It is a small, globular cactus with a compact growth habit and typically measures up to 10 centimeters in height. The plant features 10 to 15 prominent, rib-like tubercles that are covered in white to pale blue spines. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles along the ribs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
