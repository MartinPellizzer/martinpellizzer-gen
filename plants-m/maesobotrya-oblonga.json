    "intro": "Maesobotrya oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and carving, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
