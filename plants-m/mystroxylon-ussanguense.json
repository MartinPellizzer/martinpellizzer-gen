It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant's unique botanical features make it an important species in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
