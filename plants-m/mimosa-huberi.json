    "intro": "Mimosa huberi, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique foliage and compact size make it an attractive addition to gardens with limited space."
