    "intro": "Mutelia, commonly known as the satinwood or satin-leaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their glossy, often waxy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Mutelia species typically grow as small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, with some species reaching heights of up to 15 meters. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture."
