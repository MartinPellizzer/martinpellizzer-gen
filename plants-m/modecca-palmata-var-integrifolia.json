    "intro": "Modecca palmata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed modecca palm, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are smooth and unlobed, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Its inflorescences are clustered and bear small, yellowish flowers, which are followed by elongated, spiky fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
