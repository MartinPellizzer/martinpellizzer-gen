It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom during the southern hemisphere's summer, typically from December to February. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. The species is closely related to other species in the Metrosideros genus, which includes the well-known pohutukawa and rata trees."
