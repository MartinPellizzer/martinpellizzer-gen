    "intro": "Malaxis carinatifolia, commonly known as the ridge-leaf malaxis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and solitary, pendulous flowers. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's flowers typically feature a distinctive ridge on the lip, which is a key identifying feature. Its growth habit and floral structure are typical of many epiphytic and terrestrial orchids found in similar habitats."
