    "intro": "Myosotis stolonifera subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping forget-me-not, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
