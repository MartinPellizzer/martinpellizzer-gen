It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky habitats. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.
