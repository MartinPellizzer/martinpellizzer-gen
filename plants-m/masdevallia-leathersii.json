    "intro": "Masdevallia leathersii, commonly known as the Leatherleaf Masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that give it its common name, and its intricate, often colorful inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
