    "intro": "Medicago nigra var. vulgaris, commonly known as black medic, is a perennial legume native to Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a dark green color and small, purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, elliptical pods containing several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Black medic is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. It has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
