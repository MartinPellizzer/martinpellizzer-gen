    "intro": "Monocyclis robusta, commonly known as the robust cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like strobilus that produces seeds. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil and holds significant ecological and botanical value."
