    "intro": "Marattia robusta, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Marattia robusta plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
