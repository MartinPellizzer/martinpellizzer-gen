    "intro": "Malaxis laciniosa, commonly known as the lace orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched inflorescence and small, fragrant flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, narrow leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its growth habit is epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Malaxis laciniosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
