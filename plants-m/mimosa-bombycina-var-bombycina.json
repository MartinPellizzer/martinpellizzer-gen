    "intro": "Mimosa bombycina var. bombycina, commonly known as the silk tree or velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for a single flower. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
