    "intro": "Mormolyca hedwigiae, commonly known as the Hedwig's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense thallus with a smooth, green to yellowish-green surface, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Instead, it has specialized structures called rhizoids for anchoring and absorbing nutrients. Mormolyca hedwigiae plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
