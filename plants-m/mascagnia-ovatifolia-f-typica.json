It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
