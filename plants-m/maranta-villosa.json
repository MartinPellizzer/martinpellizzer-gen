    "intro": "Maranta villosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by clusters of bright red berries. Its rhizomes are valued for their starchy content, making it a useful plant in both ornamental and culinary contexts. Maranta villosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
