    "intro": "Mimosa unipinnata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid leaf movement has made it a subject of interest in botanical studies on plant responses to environmental stimuli."
