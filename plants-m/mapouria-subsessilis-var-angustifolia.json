    "intro": "Mapouria subsessilis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mapouria, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a rough, bark-like texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
