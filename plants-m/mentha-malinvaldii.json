    "intro": "Mentha malinvaldii, commonly known as Malinvald's mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, minty aroma, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Mentha malinvaldii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
