    "intro": "Mediolobivia schmiedcheniana var. karreri, commonly known as the Karreri's mediolobivia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant exhibits a compact growth form with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold and nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in complex umbels, and it blooms during the short growing season of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
