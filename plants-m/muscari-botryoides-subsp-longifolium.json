    "intro": "Muscari botryoides subsp. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are longer than those of the typical Muscari species. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
