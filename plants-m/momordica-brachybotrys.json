It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant produces small, green, bitter-tasting fruits that are typically harvested when immature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and vine-like. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are usually consumed when young and tender."
