    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. diabolina, commonly known as the devil's mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Due to its strong, minty aroma and potential toxicity, it is often used in ornamental gardening rather than culinary applications."
