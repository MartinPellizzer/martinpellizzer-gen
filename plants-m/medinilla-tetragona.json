    "intro": "Medinilla tetragona, commonly known as the four-cornered medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers. The flowers, which are typically pink or white, bloom in winter and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period."
