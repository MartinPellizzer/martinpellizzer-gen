    "intro": "Maerua arenaria var. scabra, commonly known as the rough maerua, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are small, thick, and covered in a rough, scaly texture, which helps reduce water loss. The rough maerua is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species in harsh environments."
