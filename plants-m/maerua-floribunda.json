    "intro": "Maerua floribunda, commonly known as the white thorn or African white thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the flowers are clustered in inflorescences. Maerua floribunda is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
