    "intro": "Microstachys sessilifolia f. hastata, commonly known as the broad-leafed stiltgrass, is a variant of the stiltgrass species characterized by its broader, more robust leaves. It is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers, which produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
