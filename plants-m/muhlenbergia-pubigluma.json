    "intro": "Muhlenbergia pubigluma, commonly known as the hairy muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear feathery, silver-green flowers in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Muhlenbergia pubigluma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
