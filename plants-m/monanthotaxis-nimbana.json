    "intro": "Monanthotaxis nimbana, commonly known as the cloud forest tree, is a species native to the humid tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important role in maintaining the biodiversity of its cloud forest habitat."
