    "intro": "Marsupiaria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plants typically produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Marsupiaria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to their adaptability and rapid growth."
