It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in early summer. Mentha quadrifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its aromatic, cooling scent."
