    "intro": "Machilus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly tallowtree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) underside on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in folk medicine."
