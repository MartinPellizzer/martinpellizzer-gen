    "intro": "Medicago minima f. viscida, commonly known as sticky medic. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sticky coating on the underside, which helps in water retention. Its flowers are typically pale pink to purple, arranged in small clusters, and it produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. This variety is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
