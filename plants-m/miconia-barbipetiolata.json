    "intro": "Miconia barbipetiolata, commonly known as the feather-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, feather-like veins. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
