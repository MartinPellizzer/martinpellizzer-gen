    "intro": "Malus coronaria f. charlottae, commonly known as the Charlotte apple or dwarf apple, is a compact, ornamental variant of the common crabapple. This cultivar is characterized by its small, rounded form and is typically grown as a multi-stemmed shrub or a single-trunked tree. It features showy, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible apples in the fall. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal, with attractive foliage and a slow growth rate that makes it suitable for small gardens. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
