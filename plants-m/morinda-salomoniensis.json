    "intro": "Morinda salomoniensis, commonly known as the Salomon Islands morinda, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific islands, particularly the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with simple, opposite leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
