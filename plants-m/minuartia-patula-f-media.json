    "intro": "Minuartia patula f. media, commonly known as the pale stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a versatile addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
