It is characterized by its large, woolly leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces tall, slender stalks that bear yellow flowers, which later develop into seeds. Native to Europe, it has spread to various parts of the world, including North America. Miliarium is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is known for its medicinal and historical uses."
