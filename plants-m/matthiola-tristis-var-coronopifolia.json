    "intro": "Matthiola tristis var. coronopifolia, commonly known as the Crownvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that give it a fern-like appearance. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
