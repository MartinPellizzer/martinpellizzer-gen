    "intro": "Mimosa illinoensis, commonly known as the Illinois sensitiveplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central United States. It features compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and along stream banks. Mimosa illinoensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
