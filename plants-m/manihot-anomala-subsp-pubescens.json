    "intro": "Manihot anomala subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the arrowleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a pubescent texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
