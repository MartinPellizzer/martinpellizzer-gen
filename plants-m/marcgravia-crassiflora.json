    "intro": "Marcgravia crassiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered coca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are often mistaken for actual flowers. Its leaves are typically large and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture. Marcgravia crassiflora is often found growing in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory."
