    "intro": "Maxillaria balsamea, commonly known as the balsam orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces fragrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its roots are often covered in a spongy, moss-like tissue. Maxillaria balsamea prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. It is also known for its ability to bloom reliably under proper care conditions."
