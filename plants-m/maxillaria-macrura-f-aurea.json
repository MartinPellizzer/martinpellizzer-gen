It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive dark green lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often arranged in a fan-like pattern. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
