It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in agriculture and ecological restoration. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
