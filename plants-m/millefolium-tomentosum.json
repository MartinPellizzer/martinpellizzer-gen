    "intro": "Millefolium tomentosum, commonly known as woolly yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided into fine, needle-like segments, and the plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters. Millefolium tomentosum is often found in rocky or dry soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
