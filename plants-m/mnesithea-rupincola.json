It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered inflorescence. The plant typically features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
