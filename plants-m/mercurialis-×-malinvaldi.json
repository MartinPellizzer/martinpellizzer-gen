    "intro": "Mercurialis \u00d7 malinvaldi, commonly known as the hybrid mercury plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that make it distinct from its parent species."
