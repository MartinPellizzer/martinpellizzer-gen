It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it both a common weed and a potential invasive species. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds through a mechanism involving a spring-like structure. Mikania involucrata is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
