It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in tiny, bladder-like structures. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open habitats."
