    "intro": "Machilus dumicola, commonly known as the mountain laurel, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
