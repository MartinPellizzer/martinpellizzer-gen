    "intro": "Morella integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, smooth, elliptical leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and wetlands. Morella integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils."
