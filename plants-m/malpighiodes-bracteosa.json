    "intro": "Malpighiodes bracteosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Malpighiodes bracteosa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
