    "intro": "Momordica bricchettii, commonly known as the Bricci's bitter melon, is a vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to parts of Central and South America, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates. The plant produces elongated, spiny fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn orange or red when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a climbing habit with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, bitter taste and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though it requires careful handling due to its sharp thorns."
