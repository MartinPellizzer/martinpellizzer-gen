    "intro": "Mida persicaria, commonly known as redstem filaree, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branched stems that are typically reddish in color, especially when mature. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five white petals and prominent yellow stamens, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, often with a reddish tinge on the underside. Mida persicaria is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields, where it can become a weed."
