    "intro": "Microlepia firmula, commonly known as the firm fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, moss-like coating, which helps retain moisture. Microlepia firmula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
