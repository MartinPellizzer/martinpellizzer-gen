    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. baetica, commonly known as the Spanish forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
