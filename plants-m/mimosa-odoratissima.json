    "intro": "Mimosa odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
