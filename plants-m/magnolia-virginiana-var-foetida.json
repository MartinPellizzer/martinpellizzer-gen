    "intro": "Magnolia virginiana var. foetida, commonly known as the stinkbush magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, woody fruits called follicles, which contain seeds covered in a hairy coating. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The species is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
