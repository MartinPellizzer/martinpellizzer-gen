    "intro": "Mylanche, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Mylanche is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
