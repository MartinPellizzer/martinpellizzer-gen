It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flower heads that are surrounded by white ray florets. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils in sunny locations. It produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils in its foliage and flowers. This cultivar is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has mild medicinal properties similar to regular chamomile."
