    "intro": "Mimosa monclovensis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa monclovensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptive responses to environmental stimuli."
