    "intro": "Melaleuca imbricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by distinctive, cup-shaped\u84b4\u679c. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a greyish-green color. Melaleuca imbricata is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
