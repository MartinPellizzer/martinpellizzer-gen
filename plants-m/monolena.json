    "intro": "Monolena, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either lobed or entire, and they produce small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. Monolena species are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. They are characterized by their slender stems and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
