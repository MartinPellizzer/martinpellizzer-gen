    "intro": "Malleola microphyton, commonly known as the small-leaved malleola, is a unique plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around its stems. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the leaves. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Malleola microphyton is primarily found in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
