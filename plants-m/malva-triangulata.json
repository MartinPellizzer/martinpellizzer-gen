It features palmately lobed leaves that are typically triangular in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Malva triangulata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can also serve as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
