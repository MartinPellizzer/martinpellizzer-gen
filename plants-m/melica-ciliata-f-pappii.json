    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. pappii, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a variant of the false brome species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive hairy texture along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, greenish flowers that are often subtended by bracts. This form is notable for its hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties within the Melica genus."
