    "intro": "Miscanthidium sorghum, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a small annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, three-angled seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
