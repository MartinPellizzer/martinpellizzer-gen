    "intro": "Mikania tomentosa, commonly known as horsehead vine, is a vigorous, climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into slender, seed-filled pods. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
