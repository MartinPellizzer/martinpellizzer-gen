    "intro": "Microlepia akhoensis, commonly known as the Akho fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Microlepia akhoensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species."
