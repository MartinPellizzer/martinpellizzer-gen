    "intro": "Meineckia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's meineckia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Meineckia humbertii is considered a vulnerable species."
