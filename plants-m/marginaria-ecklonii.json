    "intro": "Marginaria ecklonii, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Marginaria ecklonii has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
