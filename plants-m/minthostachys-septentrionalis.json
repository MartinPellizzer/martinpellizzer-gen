It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is known for its aromatic oils and medicinal properties. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies due to their cooling and antiseptic qualities."
