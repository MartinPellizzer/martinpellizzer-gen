    "intro": "Mentha aquatica obscura, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and wet meadows. Mentha aquatica obscura is known for its aromatic, minty scent and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
