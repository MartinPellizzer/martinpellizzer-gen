    "intro": "Manulea halimifolia, commonly known as the rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Manulea halimifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
