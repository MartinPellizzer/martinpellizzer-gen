    "intro": "Mariscus californicus, commonly known as the California marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
