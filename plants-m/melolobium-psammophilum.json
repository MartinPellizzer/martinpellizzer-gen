    "intro": "Melolobium psammophilum, commonly known as the sandhill globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its globular, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are small, hairy, and often arranged in a rosette pattern to reduce water loss. Melolobium psammophilum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
