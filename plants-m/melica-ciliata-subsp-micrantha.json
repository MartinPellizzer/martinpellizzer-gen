    "intro": "Melica ciliata subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with ciliate (fringed) margins, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat diversity. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
