    "intro": "Myrodia floribunda, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from red to pink, which bloom in spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, adapting to its arid and saline environments. Myrodia floribunda is often found growing on coastal cliffs and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in coastal flora."
