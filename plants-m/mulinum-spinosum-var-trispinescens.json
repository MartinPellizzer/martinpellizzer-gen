    "intro": "Mulinum spinosum var. trispinescens, commonly known as the three-spined mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by long, slender seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its spiny structures and medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
