    "intro": "Mostuea pervilleana, commonly known as the pink dwarf lily, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20-30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in moist, sunny habitats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
