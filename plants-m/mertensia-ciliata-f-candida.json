It is a herbaceous perennial with striking, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical interest lies in its unique floral coloration and its role in supporting pollinators."
