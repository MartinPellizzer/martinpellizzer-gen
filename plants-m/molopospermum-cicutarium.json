    "intro": "Molopospermum cicutarium, commonly known as the common burrweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive burr-like fruits that are equipped with hooked bracts for seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
