    "intro": "Mikania bracteosa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and forest edges. It has a rapid growth rate and can form dense mats, which can be invasive in some regions. Its fibrous roots and ability to climb or trail make it adaptable to various environments."
