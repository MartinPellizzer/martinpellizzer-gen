    "intro": "Melissitus ruthenicus var. inschanicus, commonly known as the Siberian honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often grow along the ground, covered in small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its berries, which ripen to a deep red, are edible and have a tart flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, temperate environments."
