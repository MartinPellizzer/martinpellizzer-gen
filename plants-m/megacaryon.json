    "intro": "Megacaryon, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its enormous, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant's roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its stems extend upward to support the broad leaves. The flowers of Megacaryon are typically white or pink, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. This plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
