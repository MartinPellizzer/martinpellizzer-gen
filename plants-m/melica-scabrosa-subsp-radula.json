It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
