It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are divided into four lobes resembling a clover leaf. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks, followed by dark, spherical fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
