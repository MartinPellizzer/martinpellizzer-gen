    "intro": "Mertensia nigropaleacea, commonly known as the black pale-flowered bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high Andes of South America. It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of its slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are often hairy and covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
