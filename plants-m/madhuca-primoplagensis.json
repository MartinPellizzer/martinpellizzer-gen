    "intro": "Madhuca primoplagensis, commonly known as the Philippine mahogany or white mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction, although its conservation status is a concern due to habitat loss."
