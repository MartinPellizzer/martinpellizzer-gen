    "intro": "Maranta closonii, commonly known as the \"Prayer Plant,\" is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that change color with the time of day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The leaves fold upwards at night and unfold in the morning, a unique adaptation to conserve moisture and protect against predators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
