    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys var. americana, commonly known as the American ghost plant, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host trees for nutrients. It is found in the eastern United States, typically in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique morphology includes a slender stem and a cluster of small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized symbiotic relationships and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
