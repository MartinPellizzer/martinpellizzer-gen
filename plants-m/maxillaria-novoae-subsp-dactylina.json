    "intro": "Maxillaria novoae subsp. dactylina, commonly known as the Dactylina orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with each pseudobulb producing a single, fleshy leaf and a raceme of fragrant, showy flowers. The flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white with prominent purple or brown markings, and they bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil, and it is often found growing in rocky or mossy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for collectors and horticultural enthusiasts."
