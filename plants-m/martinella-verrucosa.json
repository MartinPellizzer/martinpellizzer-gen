    "intro": "Martinella verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white or gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its sap contains latex, which is milky and can be toxic to some animals. Martinella verrucosa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests."
