    "intro": "Mollia spadicea, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with numerous tiny, hooded flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clumps. Mollia spadicea plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
