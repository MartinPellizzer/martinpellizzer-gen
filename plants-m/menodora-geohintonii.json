It belongs to the Menispermaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
