    "intro": "Metastelma organense, commonly known as the Organ Mountains mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, adapting to high-altitude conditions with its compact growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Metastelma organense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
