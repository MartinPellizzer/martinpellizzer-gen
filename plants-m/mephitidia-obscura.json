    "intro": "Mephitidia obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom once a year, typically in late spring or early summer. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mephitidia obscura is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
