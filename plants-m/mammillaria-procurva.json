    "intro": "Mammillaria procurva, commonly known as the hooked mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements. Mammillaria procurva is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
