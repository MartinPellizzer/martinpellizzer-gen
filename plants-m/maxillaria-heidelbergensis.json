    "intro": "Maxillaria heidelbergensis, commonly known as the Heidelberg orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically blooms in the summer, with flowers that range from white to pale pink and often have a yellowish throat. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting a single or few leaves, and it prefers warm, humid environments with good air circulation. Maxillaria heidelbergensis is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
