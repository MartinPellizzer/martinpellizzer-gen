    "intro": "Miconia angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia angustiflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habits."
