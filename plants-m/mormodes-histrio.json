    "intro": "Mormodes histrio, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red flowers that resemble flames, making it a visually striking plant. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, often with a waxy coating to help retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps."
