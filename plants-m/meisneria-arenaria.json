    "intro": "Meisneria arenaria, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Meisneria arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
