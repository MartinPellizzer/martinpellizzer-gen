    "intro": "Micraea, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. Micraea typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and sandy plains. The plant is often found in regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
