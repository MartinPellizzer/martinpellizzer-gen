    "intro": "Mimosa paucifolia var. scoparia, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which open in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
