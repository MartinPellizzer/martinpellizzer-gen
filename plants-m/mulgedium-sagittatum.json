    "intro": "Mulgedium sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks. Mulgedium sagittatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
