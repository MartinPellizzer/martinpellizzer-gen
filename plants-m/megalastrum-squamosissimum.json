    "intro": "Megalastrum squamosissimum, commonly known as the scaly leaf heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in forest understories or open sandy areas. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a distinctive scaly texture, which helps reduce water loss in its often dry or shaded habitat. The flowers, usually pink or red, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
