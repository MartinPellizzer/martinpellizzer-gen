    "intro": "Macaranga louisiadum, commonly known as the Bismarck Island paper mulberry, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its fast growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
