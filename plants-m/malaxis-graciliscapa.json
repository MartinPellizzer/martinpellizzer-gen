    "intro": "Malaxis graciliscapa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
