It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
