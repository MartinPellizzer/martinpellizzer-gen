    "intro": "Minuartia bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Native to the Balkan region, this plant thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds via wind. Minuartia bosniaca is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in mountainous regions."
