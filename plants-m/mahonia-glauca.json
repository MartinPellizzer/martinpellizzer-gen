    "intro": "Mahonia glauca, commonly known as the blue mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and seasonal blooms."
