    "intro": "Micrantheum ericoides var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often acidic and well-drained soil habitat. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the wetland and upland ecosystems of its native range."
