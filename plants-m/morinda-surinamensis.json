    "intro": "Morinda surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Morinda surinamensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
