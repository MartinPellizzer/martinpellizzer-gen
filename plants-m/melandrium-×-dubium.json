    "intro": "Melandrium \u00d7 dubium, commonly known as the common bladder campion, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between two species of the genus Melandrium. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, waste areas, and along roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
