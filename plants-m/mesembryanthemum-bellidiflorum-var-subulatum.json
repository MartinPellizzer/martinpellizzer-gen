It features fleshy, spiny leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
