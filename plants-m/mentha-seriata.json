    "intro": "Mentha seriata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Mentha seriata is typically found in moist, woodland habitats and is often used in herbal teas for its refreshing aroma and mild minty flavor. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ecological and culinary purposes."
