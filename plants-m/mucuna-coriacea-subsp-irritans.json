    "intro": "Mucuna coriacea subsp. irritans, commonly known as the hairy urd bean, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, compound leaves and distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces elongated, serpentine pods containing elliptical, dark brown seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
