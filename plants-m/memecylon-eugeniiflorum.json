    "intro": "Memecylon eugeniiflorum, commonly known as the white memecylon, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has simple, opposite, elliptic leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. These flowers are followed by small, three-lobed berries that mature to a dark purple color. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses."
