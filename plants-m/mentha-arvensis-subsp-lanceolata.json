It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and strong, aromatic menthol scent. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
