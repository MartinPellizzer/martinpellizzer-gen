    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum hispifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding visual interest to its appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
