    "intro": "Mormodes ramirezii, commonly known as the Ramirez's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a short, compact stem with a few leaves and produces its flowers in clusters near the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
