    "intro": "Moquiniastrum gardneri, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Moquiniastrum gardneri plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and habitat."
