    "intro": "Micromeles ochracea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive spurred structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall low-growing habit. Micromeles ochracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
