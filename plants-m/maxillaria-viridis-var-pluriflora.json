It is characterized by its compact, evergreen pseudobulbs and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-white flowers with yellow markings, often blooming in late winter to early spring. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
