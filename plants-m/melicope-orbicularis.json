    "intro": "Melicope orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular melicope, is a species of flowering plant in the Rutaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its orbicular (round or nearly round) leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. Its fruits are drupes, containing a single seed, and the plant is often found in lowland forests or along stream banks. Melicope orbicularis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems."
