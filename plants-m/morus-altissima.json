    "intro": "Morus altissima, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia but widely cultivated in the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-white on the underside. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture. Morus altissima is often grown for its fruit, silkworm food, and ornamental value."
