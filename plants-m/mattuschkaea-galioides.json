    "intro": "Mattuschkaea galioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mossy twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and reduced leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or brown, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Mattuschkaea galioides plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
