It is native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries like Ghana, Togo, and Nigeria. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Macaranga togoensis is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and can be used in traditional medicine."
