    "intro": "Milium scopolianum, commonly known as the scopolian grass, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it often thrives in dry, open habitats. Milium scopolianum is typically found in meadows, rocky soils, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
