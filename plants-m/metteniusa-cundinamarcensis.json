It is native to the Andes Mountains in Colombia, where it thrives in high-altitude, cool, and moist environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a glossy appearance, while its fruits are small, berry-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
