    "intro": "Mackinlaya macrosciadea, commonly known as the giant swamp lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has broad, strap-like leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrates of wetlands. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
