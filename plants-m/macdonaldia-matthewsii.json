    "intro": "Macdonaldia matthewsii, commonly known as the Macdonald's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
