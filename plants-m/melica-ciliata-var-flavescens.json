    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-haired grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with fine, hairy margins. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are typically yellow-green in color. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
