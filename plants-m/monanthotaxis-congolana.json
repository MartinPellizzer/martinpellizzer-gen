    "intro": "Monanthotaxis congolana, commonly known as the Congo monanthotaxis, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Annonaceae, which includes many tropical trees and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and its small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish drupe that contains a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
