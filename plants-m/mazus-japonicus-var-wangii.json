    "intro": "Mazus japonicus var. wangii, commonly known as the Japanese mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady garden settings. Due to its compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for ground cover in shaded areas."
