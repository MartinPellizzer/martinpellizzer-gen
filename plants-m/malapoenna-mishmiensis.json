    "intro": "Malapoenna mishmiensis, commonly known as the Mishmi bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, preferring cool and humid climates. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Malapoenna mishmiensis is considered an endangered species."
