    "intro": "Marsdenia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest milkweed, is a climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
