    "intro": "Mentha dryophila, commonly known as the alpine mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Mentha dryophila is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
