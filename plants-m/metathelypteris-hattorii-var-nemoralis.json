    "intro": "Metathelypteris hattorii var. nemoralis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
