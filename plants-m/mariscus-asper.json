It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Mariscus asper is often found in rocky or dry habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its toxic properties make it a plant to be handled with care."
