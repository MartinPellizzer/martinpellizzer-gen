    "intro": "Morgania juncea, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Morgania juncea is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
