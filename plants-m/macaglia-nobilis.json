    "intro": "Macaglia nobilis, commonly known as the noble macaglia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats, preferring full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
