    "intro": "Medicago viscidula, commonly known as sticky medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. Medicago viscidula is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
