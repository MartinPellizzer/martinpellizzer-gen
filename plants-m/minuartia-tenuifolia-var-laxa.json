    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia var. laxa, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features tiny, scale-like leaves that are arranged closely along its stems, reducing water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates."
