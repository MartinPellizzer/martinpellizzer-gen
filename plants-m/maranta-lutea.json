    "intro": "Maranta lutea, commonly known as the golden arrowroot, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy food source, similar to arrowroot. Maranta lutea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible roots."
