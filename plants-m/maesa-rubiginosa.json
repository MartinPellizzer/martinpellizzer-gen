    "intro": "Maesa rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed maesa, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
