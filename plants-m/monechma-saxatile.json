    "intro": "Monechma saxatile, commonly known as the saxatile monechma, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
