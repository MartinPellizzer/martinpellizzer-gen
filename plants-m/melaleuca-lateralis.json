    "intro": "Melaleuca lateralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. Melaleuca lateralis is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
