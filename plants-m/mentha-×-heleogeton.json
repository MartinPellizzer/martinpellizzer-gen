    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 heleogeton, commonly known as marsh mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between water mint (Mentha aquatica) and catnip (Nepeta cataria). It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies for their purported calming and digestive properties. Mentha \u00d7 heleogeton is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
