    "intro": "Mimosa polycarpa var. spegazzinii, commonly known as the Spegazzini mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant native to South America. It is a shrub characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and unique leaf response make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both beauty and interest."
