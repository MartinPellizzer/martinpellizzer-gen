    "intro": "Melaleuca ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty tea tree, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a rusty-colored, powdery coating, which gives the plant its common name. Melaleuca ferruginea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
