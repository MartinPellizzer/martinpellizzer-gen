It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and prairies. It has a creeping growth habit and produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping."
