    "intro": "Meliosma lanceolata var. chartacea, commonly known as the chartaceous meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, chartaceous (paper-like) leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down. The leaves turn a striking yellow in the fall, making it a notable ornamental plant. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by dark brown, capsule-like fruits."
