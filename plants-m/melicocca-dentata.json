    "intro": "Melicocca dentata, commonly known as the Cuban hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or red center. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, contributing to its propagation in tropical and subtropical regions."
