    "intro": "Microlepia ganlanbaensis, commonly known as the Ganlanbaensis chain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices of limestone formations. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microlepia ganlanbaensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
