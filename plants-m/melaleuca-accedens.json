    "intro": "Melaleuca accedens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca accedens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
