    "intro": "Magnolia alejandrae, commonly known as the Alejandra's magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of western Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
