    "intro": "Mascagnia lanata, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruits are berries that change from green to red as they mature, and they contain toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested. Mascagnia lanata is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, where it thrives in full sun."
