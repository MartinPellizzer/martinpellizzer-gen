    "intro": "Monogramma interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted maidenhair fern, is a delicate and intricate fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble the delicate structure of a fern. The plant features small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of interrupted segments that give it its common name. Monogramma interrupta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats."
