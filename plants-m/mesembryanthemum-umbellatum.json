    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum umbellatum, commonly known as the common ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions contributes to its resilience and widespread cultivation."
