    "intro": "Melampodium cinereum var. argophyllum, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, open habitats like woodlands and prairies. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils."
