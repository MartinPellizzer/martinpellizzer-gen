    "intro": "Mentha serpyllifolia, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. Ground ivy is known for its strong, mint-like aroma and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as lawns and gardens. It is considered both a useful medicinal plant and a persistent weed due to its spreading growth habit."
