    "intro": "Melaleuca clavifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca clavifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
