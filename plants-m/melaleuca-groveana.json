    "intro": "Melaleuca groveana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Melaleuca groveana is typically found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
