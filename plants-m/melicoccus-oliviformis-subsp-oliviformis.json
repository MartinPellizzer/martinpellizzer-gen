    "intro": "Melicoccus oliviformis subsp. oliviformis, commonly known as the olive fruit fly, is a species of fruit fly native to the Americas. It is primarily associated with the cultivation of olive trees, where its larvae feed on the fruit, causing significant economic damage. The plant is characterized by its small, dark, oval-shaped fruits that are typically clustered on the branches. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its impact on olive production, it is a subject of extensive agricultural research and pest management strategies."
