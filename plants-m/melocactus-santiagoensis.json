    "intro": "Melocactus santiagoensis, commonly known as the Santiagoensis melon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and a spiny, segmented stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Melocactus santiagoensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
