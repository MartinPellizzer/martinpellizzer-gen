It is characterized by its distinctive sickle-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
