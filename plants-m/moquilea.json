    "intro": "Moquilea, commonly known as the \"cactus of the Andes,\" is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water for survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its rugged habitat. Moquilea is adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its structure and growth patterns reflect the evolutionary strategies of desert flora."
