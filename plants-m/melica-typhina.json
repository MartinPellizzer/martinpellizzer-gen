    "intro": "Melica typhina, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Melica typhina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
