    "intro": "Medicago italica subsp. lenticularis, commonly known as the lens vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
