    "intro": "Moquinia racemosa, commonly known as marsh arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in elongated, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Moquinia racemosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
