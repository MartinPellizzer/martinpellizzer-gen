    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacanthoides, commonly known as the rough medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clustered, small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in autumn, though they are often tough and astringent when unripe. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils. Mespilus oxyacanthoides is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
