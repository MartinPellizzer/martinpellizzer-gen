    "intro": "Myrtomera gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree, is a species native to certain regions of Australia. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that exudes a sticky resin, which is a key feature of the genus. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The gum tree plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes."
