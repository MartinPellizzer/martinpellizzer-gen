    "intro": "Mazus stachydifolius, commonly known as the sticky mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
