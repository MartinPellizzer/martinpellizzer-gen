    "intro": "Myroxylon hawaiense, commonly known as the Hawaiian mahogany, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that was historically valued for its high quality. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the lowland rainforests of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
