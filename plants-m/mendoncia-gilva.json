    "intro": "Mendoncia gilva, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss. Mendoncia gilva is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
