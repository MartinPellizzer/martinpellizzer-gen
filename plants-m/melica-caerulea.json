    "intro": "Melica caerulea, commonly known as blue brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually blue or purplish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Melica caerulea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
