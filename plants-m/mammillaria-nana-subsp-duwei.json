    "intro": "Mammillaria nana subsp. duwei, commonly known as the dwarf hedgehog cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid environments."
