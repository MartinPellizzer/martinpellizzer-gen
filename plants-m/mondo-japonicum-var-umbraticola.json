    "intro": "Mondo japonicum var. umbraticola, commonly known as the shade mondo grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It features dense, mat-forming foliage composed of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. This variety thrives in partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming a lush carpet of foliage. The plant is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal water and fertilizer once established."
