    "intro": "Monteverdia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize monteverdia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
