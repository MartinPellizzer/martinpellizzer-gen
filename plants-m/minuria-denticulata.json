It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are palmately divided, with serrated edges that give it the \"toothed\" appearance in its common name. Minuria denticulata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
