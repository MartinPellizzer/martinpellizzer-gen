    "intro": "Micrelium, commonly known as the tiny fern, is a genus of small, delicate ferns belonging to the family Onocleaceae. These plants are characterized by their compact, often creeping growth habit and small, finely divided fronds. They typically thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Micrelium species are known for their unique reproductive structures, including small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of their fronds. Due to their limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, many species within this genus are considered rare or endangered."
