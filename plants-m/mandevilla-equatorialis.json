    "intro": "Mandevilla equatorialis, commonly known as the tropical mandevilla, is a vigorous, climbing vine native to South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a white throat. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and provide a lush, green backdrop to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla equatorialis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
