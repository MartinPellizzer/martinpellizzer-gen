    "intro": "Mimosa gracilis var. genuina, commonly known as the slender mimosa, is a delicate shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
