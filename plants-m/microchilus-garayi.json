    "intro": "Microchilus garayi, commonly known as the Garay's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microchilus garayi is considered a vulnerable species."
