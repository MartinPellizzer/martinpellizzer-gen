    "intro": "Marattia tuyamae, commonly known as the Tuyama's water fern, is a rare and ancient species of fern belonging to the Marattiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori on the underside. Native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments near streams and water bodies. The plant exhibits a primitive reproductive system, with spores dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Marattia tuyamae is considered a vulnerable species."
