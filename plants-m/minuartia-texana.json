    "intro": "Minuartia texana, commonly known as Texas rockcress, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
