    "intro": "Mammillaria haseloffii, commonly known as the Haseloff's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
