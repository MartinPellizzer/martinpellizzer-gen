    "intro": "Mimosa nuda f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to South America. It features small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its low maintenance and unique foliage, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a resilient, visually interesting plant."
