    "intro": "Mammillaria bockii, commonly known as the Bockii pincushion cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with a dense covering of white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
