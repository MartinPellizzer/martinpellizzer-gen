    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 pubescens var. pannonica, commonly known as Hungarian mint, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. It is often used in herbal medicine for its refreshing scent and potential digestive benefits. Its hybrid nature results from crossbreeding between Mentha \u00d7 piperita and Mentha \u00d7 spicata."
