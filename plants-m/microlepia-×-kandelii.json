    "intro": "Microlepia \u00d7 kandelii, commonly known as the Kandel's basket fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that form a basket-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
