    "intro": "Malaxis graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaf lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of small, greenish-white flowers. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive species within the orchid family. Its reproductive strategy involves mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake and survival."
