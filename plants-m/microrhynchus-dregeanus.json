    "intro": "Microrhynchus dregeanus, commonly known as the Cape orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to South Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive lip. Its root system is fibrous, and it is adapted to survive in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
