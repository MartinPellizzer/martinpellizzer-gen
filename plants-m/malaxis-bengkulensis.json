    "intro": "Malaxis bengkulensis, commonly known as the Bengkulu Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the surrounding soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
