    "intro": "Myrica chevalieri, commonly known as the Sierra cedar or California myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Myrica chevalieri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
