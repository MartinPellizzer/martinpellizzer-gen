    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron thymoides, commonly known as the lemon myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal heathland environments. Due to its unique scent and potential medicinal properties, it is also cultivated for use in aromatherapy and natural products."
