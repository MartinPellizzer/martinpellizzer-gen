    "intro": "Mentha paludosa, commonly known as swamp mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Mentha paludosa is adapted to moist or waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both traditional and modern herbal practices."
