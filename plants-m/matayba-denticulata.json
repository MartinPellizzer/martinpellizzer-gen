    "intro": "Matayba denticulata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in moist, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich coloration, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
