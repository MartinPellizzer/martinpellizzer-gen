    "intro": "Mespilus crus-galli var. linearis, commonly known as the slender wild medlar, is a variant of the wild medlar plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that ripen in late autumn, though they are typically not as widely cultivated as other medlar varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The species is noted for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
