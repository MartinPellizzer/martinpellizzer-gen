    "intro": "Muscari glaucum, commonly known as the blue musk grape or glaucous musk mallow, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often with a distinctive musky fragrance. The plant produces a bulbous stem that is often covered in a thin, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Muscari glaucum is known for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time, creating a striking visual display in late winter to early spring."
