    "intro": "Melica laxiflora f. macrior, commonly known as the broad-flowered melica, is a variant of the slender melica species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically greenish or pale blue in color. This form is distinguished by its larger, more open flower clusters compared to the typical form of the species."
