    "intro": "Mitrocereus ruficeps, commonly known as the red-headed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. The plant's structure and flowering habits make it a striking example of desert flora adaptation."
