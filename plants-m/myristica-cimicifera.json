It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). The plant produces a valuable seed known as mace, which is the aril that surrounds the nutmeg kernel. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. The tree is valued for its aromatic seeds used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
