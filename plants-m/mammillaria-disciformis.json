    "intro": "Mammillaria disciformis, commonly known as the disc-shaped mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
