    "intro": "Mandevilla aridana, commonly known as the desert mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
