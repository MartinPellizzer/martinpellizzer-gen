    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. palustris, commonly known as marsh mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinct minty scent and medicinal properties. It is a valuable component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of pollinators and invertebrates."
