    "intro": "Morettia canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the orchid family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
