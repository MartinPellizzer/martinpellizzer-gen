    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa var. glomerata, commonly known as sticky medic, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by oblong, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
