    "intro": "Medicago borealis, commonly known as the Arctic medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Medicago borealis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding plant communities."
