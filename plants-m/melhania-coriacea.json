    "intro": "Melhania coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf melhania, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rough, thick, and often hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its woody stems and persistent leaves make it a hardy shrub, often found in humid, lowland environments. Melhania coriacea is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
