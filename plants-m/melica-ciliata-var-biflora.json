    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
