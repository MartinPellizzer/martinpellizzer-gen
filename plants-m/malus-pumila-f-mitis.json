    "intro": "Malus pumila f. mitis, commonly known as the Chinese white pear, is a cultivar of the pear tree characterized by its ornamental value and fruit production. It is a deciduous tree with a compact, rounded shape and dense foliage that turns yellow in autumn. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture, providing aesthetic appeal throughout the growing season. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is small, sweet, and edible, though it is primarily grown for ornamental purposes rather than commercial fruit production."
