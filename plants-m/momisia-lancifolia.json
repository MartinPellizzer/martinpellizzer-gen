    "intro": "Momisia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved momisia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hence the species name \"lancifolia,\" and are often arranged alternately along the stems. The flowers are small and clustered, usually in racemes, and produce pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine."
