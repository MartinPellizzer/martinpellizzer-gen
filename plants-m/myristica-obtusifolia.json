    "intro": "Myristica obtusifolia, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the dual-purpose nutmeg and mace, which are derived from its seed and aril, respectively. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its valuable spice-producing properties."
