    "intro": "Matricaria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf chamomile, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of volatile oils, particularly chamazulene, which is found in the flower heads. Matricaria pusilla is often used in traditional medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
