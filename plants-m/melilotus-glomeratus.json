    "intro": "Melilotus glomeratus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Sweet clover is also valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
