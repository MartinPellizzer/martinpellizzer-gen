    "intro": "Maranta amplifolia, commonly known as the nightshade maranta, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that change color in response to light conditions, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by red berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maranta amplifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage."
