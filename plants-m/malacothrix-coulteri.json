    "intro": "Malacothrix coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's malacothrix, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Malacothrix coulteri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
