    "intro": "Merope spinosa, commonly known as the spiny merope, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stem covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Merope spinosa is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat."
