    "intro": "Mimosa antillarum, commonly known as the West Indian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Mimosa antillarum is adapted to salt spray and can thrive in brackish or saline environments."
