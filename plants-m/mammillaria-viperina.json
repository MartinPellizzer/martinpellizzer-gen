It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and typically produces yellow flowers. The plant has a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Mammillaria viperina is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
