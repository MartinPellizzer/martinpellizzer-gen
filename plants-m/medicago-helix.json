    "intro": "Medicago helix, commonly known as the horseshoe vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spirals, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. Medicago helix has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
