    "intro": "Melandrium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine catchfly, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and showy, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh alpine environments due to its low-growing habit and thick, waxy leaves."
