    "intro": "Mariscopsis suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows from rhizomes and has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive sweet aroma that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
