    "intro": "Mauloutchia heckelii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves and produces small, edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
