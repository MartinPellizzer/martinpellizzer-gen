    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed goat's horn. It is a perennial legume native to the western United States, characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This variety is notable for its shorter stature compared to other Medicago species, making it easily distinguishable in its habitat."
