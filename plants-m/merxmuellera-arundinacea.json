    "intro": "Merxmuellera arundinacea, commonly known as the reed-mace or sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in temperate regions. It features long, narrow leaves that form dense stands, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch. Merxmuellera arundinacea plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
