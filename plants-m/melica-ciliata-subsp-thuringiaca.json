It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
