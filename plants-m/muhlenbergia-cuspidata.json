    "intro": "Muhlenbergia cuspidata, commonly known as the eastern muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue on the underside. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are visually striking and attract birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an ecologically valuable plant."
