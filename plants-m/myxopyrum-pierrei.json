    "intro": "Myxopyrum pierrei, commonly known as the French moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are located on specialized stalks called caulocarps. Myxopyrum pierrei plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native range."
