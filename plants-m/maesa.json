    "intro": "Maesa, commonly known as the \"false arum,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have large, showy inflorescences composed of a spadix and a spathe, characteristic of the arum family. They often thrive in moist, shaded environments and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value. Some species of Maesa are used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
