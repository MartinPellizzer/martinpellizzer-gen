    "intro": "Melica pubescens, commonly known as hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family."
