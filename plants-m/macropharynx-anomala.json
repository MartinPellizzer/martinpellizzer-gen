    "intro": "Macropharynx anomala, commonly known as the giant pharynx orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent, bulbous lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Macropharynx anomala is often found growing on tree trunks or in the understory, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich conditions of the forest floor."
