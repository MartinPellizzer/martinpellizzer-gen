    "intro": "Mentha angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, are widely used in herbal medicine and flavoring. Mentha angustifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
