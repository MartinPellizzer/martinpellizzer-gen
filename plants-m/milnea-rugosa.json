    "intro": "Milnea rugosa, commonly known as the rough milkwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Milnea rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
