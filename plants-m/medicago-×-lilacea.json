    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 lilacea, commonly known as the yellow sweetclover, is a hybrid perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in forage and erosion control. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
