It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its leaves are usually ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
