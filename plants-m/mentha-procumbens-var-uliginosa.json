    "intro": "Mentha procumbens var. uliginosa, commonly known as swamp mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes and bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems and bloom in late summer. The aromatic leaves and stems contain essential oils, making it a valuable plant in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
