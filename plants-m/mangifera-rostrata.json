    "intro": "Mangifera rostrata, commonly known as the burr mango, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit that resembles a burr. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape. The fruit is typically small, with a thick, fibrous pulp and a single seed, and it is often used for its ornamental value rather than for consumption. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its unique appearance."
