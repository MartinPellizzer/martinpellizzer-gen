    "intro": "Mimosa insignis, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. Mimosa insignis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
