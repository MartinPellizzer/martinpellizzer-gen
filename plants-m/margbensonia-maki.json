    "intro": "Margbensonia maki, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it is relatively rare in cultivation. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
