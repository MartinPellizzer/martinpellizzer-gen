    "intro": "Marginaria neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leafed marginaria, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking dark green, almost black foliage, which contrasts sharply with its bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Marginaria neriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
