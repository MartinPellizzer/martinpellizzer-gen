    "intro": "Mimosa tremula, commonly known as the sensitive plant or the mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Mimosa tremula is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
