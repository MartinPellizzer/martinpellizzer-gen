    "intro": "Marcgravia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima skyplant, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or tree branches. Its leaves are typically large and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Marcgravia roraimae is notable for its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of the tepuis, where it plays a role in the local biodiversity."
