    "intro": "Medicago papillosa, commonly known as the silky medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive silky texture, and its flowers are typically pale pink to white, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen. Medicago papillosa is also used in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural settings."
