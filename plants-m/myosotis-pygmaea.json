It features small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and typically reaches a height of only a few inches. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Myosotis pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
