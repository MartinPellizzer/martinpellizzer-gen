    "intro": "Mikania pennellii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
