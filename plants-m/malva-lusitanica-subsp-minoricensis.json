    "intro": "Malva lusitanica subsp. minoricensis, commonly known as the Azores marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the Azores islands. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that help it spread across the ground. The fibrous stems and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their mild demulcent properties."
