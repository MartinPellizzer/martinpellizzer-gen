    "intro": "Mimosa verecunda, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mimosa verecunda is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
