    "intro": "Monelasmum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracteate monelasmum, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
