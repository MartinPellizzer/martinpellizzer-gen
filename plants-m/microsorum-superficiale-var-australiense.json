    "intro": "Microsorum superficiale var. australiense, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Australia. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are often anchored to submerged surfaces by rhizomes. Its leaves are usually divided into small, thread-like segments, giving it a feathery appearance. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
