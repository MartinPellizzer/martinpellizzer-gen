    "intro": "Misanteca aurea, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host tree and extract nutrients and water. Misanteca aurea is often found in humid, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
