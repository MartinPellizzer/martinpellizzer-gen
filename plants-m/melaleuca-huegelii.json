    "intro": "Melaleuca huegelii, commonly known as the Christmas Bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. Melaleuca huegelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
