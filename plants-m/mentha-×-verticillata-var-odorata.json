    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. odorata, commonly known as water mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which are typical of the mint family. It thrives in moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its aromatic leaves and flowers contain essential oils, making it a valuable plant in both traditional medicine and culinary uses."
