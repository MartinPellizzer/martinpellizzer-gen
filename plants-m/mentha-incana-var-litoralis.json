    "intro": "Mentha incana var. litoralis, commonly known as sea mint, is a coastal plant native to the shores of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and aromatic, menthol-like scent. This variety thrives in saline and sandy environments, making it well-adapted to coastal conditions. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats that stabilize sand dunes. The plant is often used in herbal remedies and is valued for its medicinal properties."
