    "intro": "Miconia neocrugeriana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored berry that contains numerous small, edible seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native habitat."
