    "intro": "Myotoca, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Myotoca is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
