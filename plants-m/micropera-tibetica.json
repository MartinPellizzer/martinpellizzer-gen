    "intro": "Micropera tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan micropera, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and slender stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Micropera tibetica is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its adaptation to extreme climates. Its limited distribution and ecological significance make it a subject of conservation concern."
