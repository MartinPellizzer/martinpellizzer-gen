    "intro": "Matucana yanganucensis var. salmonea, commonly known as the salmon-pink torch cactus, is a rare and striking cactus species native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with vibrant, salmon-pink spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and sought-after specimen in botanical collections."
