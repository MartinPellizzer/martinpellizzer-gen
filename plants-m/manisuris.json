    "intro": "Manisuris, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, grayish bark and produces small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Manisuris thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
