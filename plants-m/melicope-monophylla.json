    "intro": "Melicope monophylla, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mesic forests on the islands of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
