    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as sticky medick, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
