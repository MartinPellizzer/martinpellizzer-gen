It features upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are ovate with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Malva stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support pollinators."
