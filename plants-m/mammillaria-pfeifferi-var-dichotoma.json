It features dense, white to pale yellow spines and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant has a ribbed stem with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique branching pattern and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
