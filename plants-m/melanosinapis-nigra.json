    "intro": "Melanosinapis nigra, commonly known as the black velvet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals that range from deep black to dark purple, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between September and November. Its roots are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, and it requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
