    "intro": "Medicago rigidula subsp. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive ash-gray hue. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often found in disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
