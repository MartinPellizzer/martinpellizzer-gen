    "intro": "Miconia ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, ovate, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Miconia ovatifolia is also noted for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
