It is native to the Andean regions of Colombia and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Mimosa colombiana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
