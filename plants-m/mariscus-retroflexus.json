    "intro": "Mariscus retroflexus, commonly known as the trailing sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Mariscus retroflexus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
