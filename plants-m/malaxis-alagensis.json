    "intro": "Malaxis alagensis, commonly known as the alpine malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and its distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blossoms with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
