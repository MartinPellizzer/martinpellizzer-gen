    "intro": "Maireana diffusa, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are often twisted and may have a reddish or brownish hue, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Maireana diffusa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
