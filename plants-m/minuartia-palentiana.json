    "intro": "Minuartia palentiana, commonly known as the Palentian rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Minuartia palentiana is adapted to cold climates and is found in various regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
