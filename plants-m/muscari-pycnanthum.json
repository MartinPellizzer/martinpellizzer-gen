    "intro": "Muscari pycnanthum, commonly known as the dwarf grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is known for its early spring blooming habit. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowers have faded."
