    "intro": "Mildbraedia balboana, commonly known as the Balboan star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, characterized by its bulbous root system and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces white or pale blue blooms that appear in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves emerge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
