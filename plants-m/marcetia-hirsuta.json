    "intro": "Marcetia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
