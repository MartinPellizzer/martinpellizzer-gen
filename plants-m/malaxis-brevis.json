It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, making it a unique species within the Orchidaceae family."
