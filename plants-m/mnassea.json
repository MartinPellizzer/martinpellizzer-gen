    "intro": "Mnassea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, thick leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Mnassea species typically grow as compact shrubs or herbs, often with a rosette-like arrangement of leaves. They are popular houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the genus includes several species such as Mnassea corymbosa and Mnassea sphaerocarpa."
