    "intro": "Melissitus cretaceus, commonly known as the Cretaceous honeybee plant, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its unique, waxy leaves and pale yellow flowers. It is native to the chalk grasslands of southern Europe, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its name reflects its historical association with the Cretaceous period and its role in ancient pollination systems. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
