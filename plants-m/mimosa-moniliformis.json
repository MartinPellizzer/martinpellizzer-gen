    "intro": "Mimosa moniliformis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. Its unique sensitivity to touch and rapid leaf movement make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
