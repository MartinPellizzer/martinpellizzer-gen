    "intro": "Maesa latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf maesa, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Maesa latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
