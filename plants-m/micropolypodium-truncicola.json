    "intro": "Micropolypodium truncicola, commonly known as the truncated polypody, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and often grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from sori that are located on the underside of the fronds. Micropolypodium truncicola is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas."
