It is characterized by its small, dark green trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its root system fixes nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
