    "intro": "Manihot esculenta var. debilis, commonly known as the wild cassava, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Unlike the cultivated cassava, it has smaller tuberous roots that are less starchy and more fibrous. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
