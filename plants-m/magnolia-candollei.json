It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, elongated leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its rarity and beauty. The tree has a slow growth rate and prefers well-drained, acidic soils in a partially shaded to sunny environment."
