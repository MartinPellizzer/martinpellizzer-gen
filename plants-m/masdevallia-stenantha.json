    "intro": "Masdevallia stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically produces intricate, spurred petals and a unique lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Masdevallia stenantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
