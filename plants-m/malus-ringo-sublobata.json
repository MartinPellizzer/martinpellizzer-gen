    "intro": "Malus ringo sublobata, commonly known as the sublobed apple, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Malus genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that have a distinctive sublobed margin, giving it its specific epithet. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, edible fruits similar to apples. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and potentially endangered species."
