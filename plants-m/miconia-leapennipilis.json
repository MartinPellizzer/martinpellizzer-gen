    "intro": "Miconia leapennipilis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
