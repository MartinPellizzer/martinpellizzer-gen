    "intro": "Magnolia lacunosa, commonly known as the lacebark magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels to reveal a lighter, almost lace-like inner layer. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in early spring before its heart-shaped leaves emerge. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinctive veining pattern. The tree is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bark and spring blooms."
