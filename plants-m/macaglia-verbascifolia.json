    "intro": "Macaglia verbascifolia, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, grey-green leaves that resemble those of the mullein plant. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and wildflower displays. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens across southern Europe and beyond."
