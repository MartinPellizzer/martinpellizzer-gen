It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, open areas with well-drained soil.
