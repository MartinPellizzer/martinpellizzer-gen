    "intro": "Mischobulbum grandiflorum, commonly known as the grandiflorous mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds coated in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds."
