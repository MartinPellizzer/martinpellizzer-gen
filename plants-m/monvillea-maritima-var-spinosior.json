    "intro": "Monvillea maritima var. spinosior, commonly known as the spinous sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its spiny stems and leaves are adaptations to deter herbivores and reduce water loss. This species is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
