    "intro": "Marlierea excoriata, commonly known as the scarlet coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
