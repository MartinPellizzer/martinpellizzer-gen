    "intro": "Mazus japonicus var. tenuiracemus, commonly known as Japanese spurge or narrow raceme mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens for its attractive foliage and modest floral display."
