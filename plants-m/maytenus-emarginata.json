    "intro": "Maytenus emarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Celtidaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, round berries containing a single seed. It is often found in dry forests and coastal areas, and its wood is valued for its durability and workability. Maytenus emarginata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
