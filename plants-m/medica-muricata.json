    "intro": "Medica muricata, commonly known as the spiny hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Medica muricata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
