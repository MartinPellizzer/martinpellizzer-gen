    "intro": "[WRONG START] Meadiapinon saginoides, commonly known as the sacred mountain fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf sheaths, a feature that aids in its survival in harsh mountain climates. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Meiadipon saginoides is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
