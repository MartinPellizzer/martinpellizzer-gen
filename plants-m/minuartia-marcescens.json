    "intro": "Minuartia marcescens, commonly known as the winter beauty, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a succulent, fleshy stem that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically oblanceolate, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Minuartia marcescens is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
