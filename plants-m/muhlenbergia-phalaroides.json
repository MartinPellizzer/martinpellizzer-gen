    "intro": "Muhlenbergia phalaroides, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with fine, silvery-green foliage that gives it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a versatile choice for native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it an excellent ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
