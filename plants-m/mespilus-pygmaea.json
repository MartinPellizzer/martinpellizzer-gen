    "intro": "Mespilus pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf medlar, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The fruit, which is a pome, matures in the autumn and is known for its unique, aromatic qualities. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact size and seasonal interest. However, it is not widely used for fruit production due to its short shelf life and specific ripening requirements."
