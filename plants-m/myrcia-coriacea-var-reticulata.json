    "intro": "Myrcia coriacea var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate myrcia, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a network of fine veins, giving it a distinctive reticulate pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
