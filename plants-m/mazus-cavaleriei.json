    "intro": "Mazus cavaleriei, commonly known as Chinese Mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to China. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Mazus cavaleriei is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
