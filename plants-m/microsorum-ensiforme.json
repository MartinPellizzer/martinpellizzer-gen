    "intro": "Microsorum ensiforme, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often arching fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Microsorum ensiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
