    "intro": "Mammillaria micromeris var. greggii, commonly known as the Gregg's bunny ear cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with prominent, rounded tubercles that are often covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
