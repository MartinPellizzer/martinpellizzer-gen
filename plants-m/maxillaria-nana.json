It is characterized by its small, clustered pseudobulbs and narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
