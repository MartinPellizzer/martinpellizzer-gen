    "intro": "Monelasmum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Monelasmum reticulatum is valued for its ecological role, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
