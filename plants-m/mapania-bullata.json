    "intro": "Mapania bullata, commonly known as the bullate maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. Mapania bullata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
