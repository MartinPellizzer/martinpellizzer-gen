    "intro": "Mammillaria pseudoalamensis, commonly known as the Alamo prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, globular shape and a dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
