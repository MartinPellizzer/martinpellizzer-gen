    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia f. ambigua, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a hybrid plant characterized by its distinctive rounded, fuzzy leaves. It is a perennial herb native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, contributing to its use in herbal teas and traditional medicine. The fuzzy texture of its foliage is due to dense, fine hairs covering the leaf surface."
