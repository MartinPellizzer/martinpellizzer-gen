It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its morphology includes delicate, branched stems and specialized bladders for predation. Botanically, it is notable for its simple structure and adaptation to aquatic life."
