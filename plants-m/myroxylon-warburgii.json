    "intro": "Myroxylon warburgii, commonly known as the pink ivory tree, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pinkish-brown bark and produces small, yellowish flowers. The tree is notable for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically valued for its use in furniture and as a source of natural resins. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
