    "intro": "Monosis shevaroyensis, commonly known as the Shevaroy hills monosis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy texture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
