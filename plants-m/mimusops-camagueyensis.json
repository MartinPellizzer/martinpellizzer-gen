    "intro": "Mimusops camagueyensis, commonly known as the Camag\u00fcey star-apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy yellow flowers. The fruit is a round, star-shaped berry that turns from green to yellow when ripe. The plant is adapted to coastal and limestone soils, often found in mangrove ecosystems. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited economic use due to its small size and low fruit yield."
