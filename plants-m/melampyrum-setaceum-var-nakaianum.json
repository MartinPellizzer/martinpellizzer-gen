It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Melampyrum setaceum."
