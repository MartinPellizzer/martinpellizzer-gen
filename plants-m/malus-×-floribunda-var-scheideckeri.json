    "intro": "Malus \u00d7 floribunda var. scheideckeri, commonly known as the Scheideckeri crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring. The foliage is typically dark green, turning vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. Its fruit, a small apple-like pome, is edible but often tart and not widely cultivated for consumption. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
