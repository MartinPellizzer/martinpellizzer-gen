    "intro": "Maireana tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly maireana, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting well to dry conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a touch of color to its environment."
