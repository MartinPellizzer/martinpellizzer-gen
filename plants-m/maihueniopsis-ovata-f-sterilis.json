    "intro": "Maihueniopsis ovata f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile form of the common mayflower, is a rare and unique variant of the species. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of South America. The plant exhibits reduced floral characteristics, with the most notable feature being the absence of functional flowers. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological differences from the standard species."
