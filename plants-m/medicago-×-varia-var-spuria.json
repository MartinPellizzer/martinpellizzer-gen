    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 varia var. spuria, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and long, serpentine stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its hairy stems and leaves provide habitat for various insects and contribute to soil stabilization."
