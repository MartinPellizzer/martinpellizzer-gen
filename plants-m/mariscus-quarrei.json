    "intro": "Mariscus quarrei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its small, yellowish-white flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Mariscus quarrei is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
