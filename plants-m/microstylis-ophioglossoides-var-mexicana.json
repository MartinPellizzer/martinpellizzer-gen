    "intro": "Microstylis ophioglossoides var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican adder's mouth, is a rare and endangered fern species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Ophioglossaceae family, characterized by its unique and primitive morphology. The plant features a short, erect rhizome with a single, pinnately compound leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered along the leaf's veins, a trait typical of its evolutionary lineage. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
