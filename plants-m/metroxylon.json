    "intro": "Metroxylon, commonly known as the ramin tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the palm family, Arecaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making. Its trunk is characterized by a fibrous, pale-colored heartwood and a lighter, softer outer layer. Metroxylon species also produce edible fruits, though they are less commonly consumed compared to other palm fruits."
