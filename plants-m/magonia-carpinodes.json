    "intro": "Magonia carpinodes, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, pale bark and its distinctive, elongated, winged seeds called samaras. The tree has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It is often used in hedgerows and as a windbreak due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils. The wood is heavy, hard, and resistant to splitting, making it valuable for tool handles and other durable crafts."
