    "intro": "Miconia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
