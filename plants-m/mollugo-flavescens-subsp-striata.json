    "intro": "Mollugo flavescens subsp. striata, commonly known as the stripeflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy soils in coastal and inland regions of the southeastern United States. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue, and the stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. This species is well adapted to dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in dunes, roadsides, and open fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
