    "intro": "Myristica roxburghii, commonly known as nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. The seeds within these berries are the source of both nutmeg and mace, which are highly valued spices. Myristica roxburghii requires a humid, warm climate and is often cultivated in tropical regions for its economic importance."
