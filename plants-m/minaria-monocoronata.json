    "intro": "Minaria monocoronata, commonly known as the single-capped minaria, is a small, flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows from a short, thick rhizome and has finely divided, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Minaria monocoronata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often blooming after rainfall in desert landscapes."
