    "intro": "Miconia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions with volcanic soil. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
