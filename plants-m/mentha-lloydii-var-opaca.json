It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and have a minty, slightly camphor-like scent. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other mints but is valued for its unique flavor and ecological benefits."
