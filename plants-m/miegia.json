    "intro": "Miegia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that resemble the color of moonlight. The plant has a delicate, aromatic scent that is said to be most noticeable at night. Miegia thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period is brief, typically occurring only once every few years, making it a rare and sought-after botanical specimen."
