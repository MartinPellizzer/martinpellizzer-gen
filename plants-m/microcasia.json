    "intro": "Microcasia, commonly known as the \"little cassia,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. They are characterized by their compound leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Microcasia species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their vibrant floral displays. The plants also have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil."
