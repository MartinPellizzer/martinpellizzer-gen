    "intro": "Memecylon orbiculare, commonly known as the round-leaf memecylon, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
