It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
