It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. This plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense underwater mats. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer, and they are usually pale blue or purple in color.
