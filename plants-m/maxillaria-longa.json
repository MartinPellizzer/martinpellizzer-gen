It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that supports its growth during periods of dormancy. The plant produces long, slender spikes that bear numerous showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Maxillaria longa thrives in humid, well-drained environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
