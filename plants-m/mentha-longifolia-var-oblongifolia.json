It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to its minty, refreshing scent."
