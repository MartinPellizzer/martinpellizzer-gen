    "intro": "Maesa ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori maesa, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
