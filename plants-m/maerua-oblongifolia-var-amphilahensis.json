    "intro": "Maerua oblongifolia var. amphilahensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, enabling survival in extreme drought conditions. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and desert environments."
