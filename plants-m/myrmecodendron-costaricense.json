It is characterized by its unique relationship with ants, which inhabit specialized chambers within its stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a rough texture. Myrmecodendron costaricense plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and birds."
