    "intro": "Maxillaria alba, commonly known as the white maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Maxillaria alba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
