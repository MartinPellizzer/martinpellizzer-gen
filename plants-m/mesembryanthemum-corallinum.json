    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum corallinum, commonly known as the coral iceplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces bright pink or red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Mesembryanthemum corallinum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
