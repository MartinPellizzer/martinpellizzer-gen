    "intro": "Microglossa mikanioides, commonly known as the creeping microglossa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively uncommon and of interest to botanists and conservationists."
