    "intro": "Magnolia pealiana, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia or Peale's magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall with a broad, rounded crown. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value."
