It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spikes, which are often accompanied by aromatic, glandular hairs. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils. Melaleuca subalaris is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained conditions and is often used in coastal restoration projects."
