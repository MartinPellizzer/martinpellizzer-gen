    "intro": "Myrteola acerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, and often aromatic foliage, which is typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Myrteola acerosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. Its botanical features make it well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid climates."
