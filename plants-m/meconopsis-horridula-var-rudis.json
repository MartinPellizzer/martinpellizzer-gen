    "intro": "Meconopsis horridula var. rudis, commonly known as the rough meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine meadows. Its flowers are typically clustered in umbels, and the species is noted for its hardiness in cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
