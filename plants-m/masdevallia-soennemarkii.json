    "intro": "Masdevallia soennemarkii, commonly known as the Soennemark's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting the plant's unique growth form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
