    "intro": "Mimosa pedersenii, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Mimosa pedersenii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
