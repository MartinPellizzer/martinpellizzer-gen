    "intro": "Mimosa brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
