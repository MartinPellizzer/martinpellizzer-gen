    "intro": "Mitostigma tucumanense, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America, particularly in Argentina and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of trees such as *Celtis* and *Schefflera*. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals, while also drawing nutrients from its host. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
