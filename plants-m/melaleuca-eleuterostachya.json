    "intro": "Melaleuca eleuterostachya, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds."
