    "intro": "Meniscium cuspidatum var. longifrons, commonly known as the long-fruited meniscium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure called a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, narrow fruits, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
