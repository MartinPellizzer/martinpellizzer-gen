    "intro": "Masdevallia strattoniana, commonly known as the Stratton's masdevallia, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its vivid, often violet or purple, spurred flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has elongated, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, providing a contrast to the colorful blooms. This species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
