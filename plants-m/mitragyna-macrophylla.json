    "intro": "Mitragyna macrophylla, commonly known as kratom, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that develop into capsule fruits. The plant contains alkaloids, particularly mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which contribute to its medicinal and stimulant properties. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its psychoactive effects, it is subject to legal restrictions in many countries."
