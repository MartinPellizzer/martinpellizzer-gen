    "intro": "Mimosa polycarpa var. subandina, commonly known as the Andean mimosa, is a shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
