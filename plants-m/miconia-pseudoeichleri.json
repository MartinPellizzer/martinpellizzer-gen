    "intro": "Miconia pseudoeichleri, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a large, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble starfruits, which are often used in local cuisines. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a notable species in tropical botany. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature."
