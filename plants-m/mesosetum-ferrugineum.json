    "intro": "Mesosetum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and reddish-brown coloration, especially on the stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Mesosetum ferrugineum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
