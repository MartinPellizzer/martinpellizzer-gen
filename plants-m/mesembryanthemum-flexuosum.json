    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum flexuosum, commonly known as the zigzag ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Mesembryanthemum flexuosum is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
