    "intro": "Miconia schwackei, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can dominate native ecosystems. It has been classified as an invasive species in several regions due to its competitive nature and ecological impact. Miconia schwackei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and coastal areas."
