    "intro": "Maytenus acuminata var. uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves contain compounds such as arbutin, which have been used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial properties. The species is well adapted to rocky, dry environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions."
