    "intro": "Mollugo brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed carpetweed, is a small, mat-forming plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in cultivated areas. The plant has fleshy, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Mollugo brevipes is a hardy species that thrives in temperate climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
