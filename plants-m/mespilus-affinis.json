It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers and unique fruit structure. The fruit, known as a pomes, is typically unripe and astringent when harvested, but it softens and becomes edible after a process called \"mellowing.\" The plant has rough, bark-like stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
