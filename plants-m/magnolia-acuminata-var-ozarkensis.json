    "intro": "Magnolia acuminata var. ozarkensis, commonly known as the Ozark magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 feet and has a rounded, spreading canopy. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas of the Ozark region."
