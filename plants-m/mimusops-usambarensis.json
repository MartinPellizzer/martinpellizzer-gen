    "intro": "Mimusops usambarensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and dense, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red drupes containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The species is valued for its durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
