It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically a vibrant green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its aromatic leaves and stems contain menthol, giving it a refreshing, cool scent and making it useful in herbal remedies and culinary applications."
