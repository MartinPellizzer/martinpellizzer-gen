    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive involute (rolled under) base. This variety is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands."
