    "intro": "Macrolinum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a straight, cylindrical trunk with smooth, pale bark that peels off in strips. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Macrolinum flowers are small and yellowish, typically appearing in clusters, and the plant produces small, round fruits containing winged seeds."
