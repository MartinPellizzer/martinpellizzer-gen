    "intro": "Mimosa procumbens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal regions and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and unique leaf movement make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a popular ornamental plant."
