    "intro": "Melica canariensis, commonly known as Canary grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important species in ecological restoration projects."
