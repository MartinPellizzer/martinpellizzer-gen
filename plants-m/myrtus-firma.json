    "intro": "Myrtus firma, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant, dark green leaves that emit a subtle, sweet scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Myrtus firma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
