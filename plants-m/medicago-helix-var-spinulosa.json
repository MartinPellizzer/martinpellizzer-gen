    "intro": "Medicago helix var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny horseshoe vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system. This variety is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock."
