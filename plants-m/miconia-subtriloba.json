    "intro": "Miconia subtriloba, commonly known as the three-lobed miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, which are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions."
