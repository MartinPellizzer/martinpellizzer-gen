    "intro": "Maxillaria seymouriana, commonly known as the Seymour's orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and linear leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. Its flowers are characterized by their distinctive lip, which is often more brightly colored than the rest of the flower. Maxillaria seymouriana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
