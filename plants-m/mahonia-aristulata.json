    "intro": "Mahonia aristulata, commonly known as the Christmas holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that turns a vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late winter, which are followed by blue-black berries that persist into winter. Its evergreen-like appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Mahonia aristulata is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its low maintenance requirements."
