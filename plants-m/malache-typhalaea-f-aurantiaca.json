It is characterized by its striking, vibrant orange to red foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the base species. This plant belongs to the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
