    "intro": "Micronychia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved rock fig, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, spherical fig-like structure that turns red when mature. Micronychia macrophylla is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments."
