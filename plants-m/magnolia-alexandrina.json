    "intro": "Magnolia alexandrina, commonly known as the Alexandrian magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and visual appeal."
