    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris subsp. calliantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their cooling and digestive properties. This subspecies is closely related to other mints but is distinguished by its narrower leaves and distinct floral structure."
