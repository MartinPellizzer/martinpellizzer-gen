    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 pancicii, commonly known as the pineapple mint, is a hybrid mint species resulting from the cross between Mentha piperita (peppermint) and Mentha viridis (apple mint). It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly pine-like fragrance and its serrated, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Mentha \u00d7 pancicii is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun. It is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to its unique flavor profile."
