    "intro": "Moquilea tomentosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moquilea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
