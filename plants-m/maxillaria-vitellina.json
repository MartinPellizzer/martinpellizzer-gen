    "intro": "Maxillaria vitellina, commonly known as the Yellow Lady's Slipper, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, producing a sweet, spicy fragrance that attracts pollinators. The leaves are broad and leathery, providing structural support and aiding in the retention of moisture."
