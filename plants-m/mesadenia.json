    "intro": "Mesadenia, commonly known as the flame-of-the-forest, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. The genus includes several species, such as Mesadenia nervosa, which is known for its striking, clustered inflorescences. The leaves are typically simple and opposite, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Mesadenia plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
