    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 resinosa var. wuerlii, commonly known as W\u00fcrli's mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant is known for its strong menthol scent and is often cultivated for its medicinal and culinary uses. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
