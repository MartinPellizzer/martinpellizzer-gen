    "intro": "Macbridea pulchra, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom in clusters, often emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths."
