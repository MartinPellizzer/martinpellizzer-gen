    "intro": "Medicago disciformis var. strumensis, commonly known as the Balkan burclover, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, globular, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
