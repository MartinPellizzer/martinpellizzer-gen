It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that have a silvery-blue appearance due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities. The silver fern is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
