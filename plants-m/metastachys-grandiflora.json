    "intro": "Metastachys grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered within the bracts, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
