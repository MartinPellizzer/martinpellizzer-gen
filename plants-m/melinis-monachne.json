    "intro": "Melinis monachne, commonly known as goat grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Melinis monachne is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
