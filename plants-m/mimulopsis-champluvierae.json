It belongs to the family Mimulaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, featuring succulent leaves that help store water. Its growth habit is generally low and spreading, with hairy stems that provide additional protection against desiccation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
