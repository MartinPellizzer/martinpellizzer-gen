    "intro": "Mikania desmocephala var. typica, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in the morning. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
