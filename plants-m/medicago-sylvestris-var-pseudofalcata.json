    "intro": "Medicago sylvestris var. pseudofalcata, commonly known as the false crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
