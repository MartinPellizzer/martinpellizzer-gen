    "intro": "Mariscus mariscoides f. congestus, commonly known as the dense-flowered mariscus, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The 'congestus' form is distinguished by its densely packed flower clusters, which give it a more compact appearance compared to the typical form. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
