    "intro": "Monanthos procerus, commonly known as the slender tetrastigma, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces unisexual flowers, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, a feature typical of monoecious species. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. The botanical interest of Monanthos procerus lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
