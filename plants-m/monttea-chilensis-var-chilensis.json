    "intro": "Monttea chilensis var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean monttea, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its growth habit is compact, with multiple stems arising from the base, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It is adapted to coastal climates and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
