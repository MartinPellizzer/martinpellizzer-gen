    "intro": "Myricaria davurica, commonly known as the sandmat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Europe. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Myricaria davurica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
