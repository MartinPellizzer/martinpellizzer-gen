    "intro": "Minuartia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals, and bloom in early spring. Minuartia platyphylla is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
