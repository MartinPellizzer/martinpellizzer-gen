    "intro": "Mammillaria longiflora subsp. stampferi, commonly known as the Stampfer's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a dense array of small, cylindrical spines and produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 centimeters, with a rounded, segmented stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
