    "intro": "Microsorum samarense, commonly known as the Samarensis Sword Fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, swampy areas. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic substrates. Microsorum samarense is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
