    "intro": "Meringium microchilum, commonly known as the small-lipped meringium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring, producing pale yellow to greenish-white petals that are adorned with fine, hair-like structures. Its habitat is restricted to specific microclimates, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Meringium microchilum is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
