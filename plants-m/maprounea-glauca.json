    "intro": "Maprounea glauca, commonly known as the blue maple or blue-leafed maple, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which is a result of the presence of a unique pigment called glaucine. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Maprounea glauca is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
