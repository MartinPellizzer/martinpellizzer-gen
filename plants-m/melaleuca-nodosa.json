    "intro": "Melaleuca nodosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green, white, and brown beneath. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight curl, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Melaleuca nodosa is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
