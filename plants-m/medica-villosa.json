    "intro": "Medica villosa, commonly known as the hairy medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Medica villosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields, and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its adaptability and ecological benefits make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
