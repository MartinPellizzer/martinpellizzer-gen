    "intro": "Mimosa barnebiana, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa barnebiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
