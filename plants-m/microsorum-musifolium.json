    "intro": "Microsorum musifolium, commonly known as the musical fern, is a species of water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of a musical instrument, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in slow-moving streams and wetlands. Its leaves are typically light green with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Microsorum musifolium is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appearance and ability to help maintain water quality."
