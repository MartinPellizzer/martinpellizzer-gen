    "intro": "Marlea vitiensis f. salaccensis, commonly known as the Salacca marlea, is a rare and unique variant of the marlea plant native to specific regions of Viti Levu, Fiji. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in shades of white and pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
