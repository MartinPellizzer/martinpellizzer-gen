    "intro": "Montia fontana subsp. fontana, commonly known as the Fontana watercress, is a low-growing annual plant native to moist, rocky habitats in the western United States. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming a dense mat. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly succulent texture with a peppery aroma. Small white flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant produces tiny, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to wet environments, and it is often found in stream banks and mountain meadows."
