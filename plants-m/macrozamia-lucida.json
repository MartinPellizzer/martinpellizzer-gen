    "intro": "Macrozamia lucida, commonly known as the shining cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being particularly showy and often used in horticultural displays. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and dry rainforest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
