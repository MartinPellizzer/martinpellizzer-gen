    "intro": "Mapania caudata, commonly known as the hairy tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, fibrous shell and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
