    "intro": "Microdon parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered microdon, is a delicate flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance."
