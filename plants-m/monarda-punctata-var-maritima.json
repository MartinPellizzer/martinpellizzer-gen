    "intro": "Monarda punctata var. maritima, commonly known as seaside bee balm, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that grow up to 2 feet tall, supporting whorled leaves that are oval to lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, arranged in terminal clusters that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its aromatic leaves and flowers contribute to its value as both a ornamental and ecological plant."
