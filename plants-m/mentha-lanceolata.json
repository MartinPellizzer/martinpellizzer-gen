It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves and strong, aromatic mint scent. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with square stems and opposite leaves. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentha lanceolata is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its menthol content and refreshing properties."
