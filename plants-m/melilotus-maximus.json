    "intro": "Melilotus maximus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Sweet clover is often used in agricultural settings as a forage crop and for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its essential oil is also used in various industrial and pharmaceutical applications."
