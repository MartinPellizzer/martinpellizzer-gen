    "intro": "Merostachys capitata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and swampy areas in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in flooded forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
