    "intro": "Munnozia tenera, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in drought conditions. Its showy, white to pink flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Munnozia tenera is adapted to extreme heat and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in harsh desert climates."
