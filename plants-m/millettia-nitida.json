    "intro": "Millettia nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf acacia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage composed of small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in landscaping and as a shade tree in warmer climates."
