    "intro": "Macrolobium limbatum var. propinquum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf macrolobium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
