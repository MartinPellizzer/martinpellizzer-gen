    "intro": "Microrhamnus mairei, commonly known as the Maire\u2019s buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
