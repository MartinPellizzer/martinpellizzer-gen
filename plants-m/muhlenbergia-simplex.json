    "intro": "Muhlenbergia simplex, commonly known as pink muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces delicate, pink to purple flower spikes in the summer, which add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Muhlenbergia simplex is drought-tolerant and is often used in native plant gardens for its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
