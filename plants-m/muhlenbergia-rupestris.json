    "intro": "Muhlenbergia rupestris, commonly known as the cliff muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, silver-green leaves that are often lined with fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
