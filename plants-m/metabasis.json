    "intro": "Metabasis, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by a cluster of bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. Metabasis is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance but has distinct botanical traits."
