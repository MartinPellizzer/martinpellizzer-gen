It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are short and thick, supporting its dense, clustered growth habit. The fronds are usually dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, narrow, linear shape."
