    "intro": "Malaxis kabensis, commonly known as the Kabense Malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
