    "intro": "Malleola pallida, commonly known as the pale malleola, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its scientific name reflects its pale coloration and the genus name \"Malleola,\" which is derived from the Latin word for a small branch. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
