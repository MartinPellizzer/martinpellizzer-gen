    "intro": "Melargyra rubra, commonly known as the redleaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically red or pink in color, which help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are erect and can grow up to 30 centimeters tall, often branching near the base. Melargyra rubra is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in dry climates."
