    "intro": "Medicago lupulina subvar. eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose racemes, followed by elongated, hairy pods containing lens-shaped seeds. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions worldwide. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and as a cover crop."
