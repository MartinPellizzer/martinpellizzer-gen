It is native to Australia and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers, which are typically followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
