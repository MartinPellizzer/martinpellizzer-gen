    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. major-prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sickle vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant characterized by its prostrate or decumbent growth habit. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in racemate clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its root system contributes to nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is also valued for forage in certain agricultural contexts."
