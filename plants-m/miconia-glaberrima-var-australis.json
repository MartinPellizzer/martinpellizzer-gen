    "intro": "Miconia glaberrima var. australis, commonly known as the southern miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
