It is characterized by its bright orange or yellow flowers, which are typically spurred at the back, a feature common in the genus Mimulus. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streambanks and wet meadows. It is a perennial herb that produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
