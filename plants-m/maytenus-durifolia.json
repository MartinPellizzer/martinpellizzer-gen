    "intro": "Maytenus durifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved mayten, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Maytenus durifolia is often found in dry forests and shrublands, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
