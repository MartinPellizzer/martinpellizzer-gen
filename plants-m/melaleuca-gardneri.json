    "intro": "Melaleuca gardneri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces rough, woody fruits called follicles, which contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. Melaleuca gardneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
