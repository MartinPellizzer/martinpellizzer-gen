It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Myrcia granulata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional uses in local communities."
