It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by orange or red berries. Moriera umbellata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying properties."
