    "intro": "Mertensia foliosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent leaf bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, hairy leaves that give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
