It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. The plant features long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, supported by slender, spongy stems. Its most distinguishing feature is the white, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a slight pinkish hue. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
