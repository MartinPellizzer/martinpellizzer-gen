    "intro": "Macadamia ternifolia var. typica, commonly known as the common macadamia, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of hard, woody pods containing the edible nuts. The leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is well adapted to coastal and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils."
