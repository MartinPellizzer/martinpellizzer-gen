    "intro": "Myosotis kebeshensis, commonly known as the Kebesh forget-me-not, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
