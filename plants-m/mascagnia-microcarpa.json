    "intro": "Mascagnia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited mascagnia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are small and elliptical, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Mascagnia microcarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
