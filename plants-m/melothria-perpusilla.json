It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruits are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor, making them suitable for culinary use in some regions."
