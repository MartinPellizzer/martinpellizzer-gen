    "intro": "Mespilus ovalis, commonly known as the oval medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its oval-shaped fruits, which are typically green when mature. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while the flowers are white and appear in clusters. The plant is known for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its slow growth and specific environmental requirements."
