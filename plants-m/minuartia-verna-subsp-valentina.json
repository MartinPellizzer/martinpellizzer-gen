    "intro": "Minuartia verna subsp. valentina, commonly known as the spring rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, evergreen leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
