    "intro": "Myrica rapaneoidea, commonly known as the red cedar or swamp cedar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and its distinctive, aromatic, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces catkin-like flowers and small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and swamps. Myrica rapaneoidea plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and stabilizing wetland environments."
