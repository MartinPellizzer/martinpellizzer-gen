    "intro": "Melliodendron jifungense, commonly known as the Kifungu yellowwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Eastern African region. It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish wood and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in montane forests, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a lanceolate shape with a smooth margin. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Melliodendron jifungense is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
