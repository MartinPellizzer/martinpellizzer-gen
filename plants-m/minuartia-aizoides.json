    "intro": "Minuartia aizoides, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a small, low-growing perennial plant that thrives in rocky or gravelly environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. This species is typically found in alpine or arctic regions, where it adapts to harsh, cold climates. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in poor soil conditions make it a hardy member of the Caryophyllaceae family. Minuartia aizoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
