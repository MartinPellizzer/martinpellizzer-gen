    "intro": "Micromeria palmensis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual with narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep taproots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Micromeria palmensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is part of the Geraniaceae family."
