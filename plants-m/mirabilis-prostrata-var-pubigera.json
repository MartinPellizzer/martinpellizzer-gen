    "intro": "Mirabilis prostrata var. pubigera, commonly known as the spreading four o'clock, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features clusters of showy, tubular flowers that open in the late afternoon and remain open through the night. The plant has thin, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
