    "intro": "Moehringia flaccida, commonly known as the slender moehringia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Moehringia flaccida plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
