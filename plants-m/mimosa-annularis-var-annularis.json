It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. It is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate saline soils. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates."
