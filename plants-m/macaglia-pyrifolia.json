    "intro": "Macaglia pyrifolia, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant red, orange, or yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, with a rounded or spreading habit. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age."
