    "intro": "Medicago falcata subsp. tenderiensis, commonly known as the tenderien medick, is a perennial legume native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in semi-arid regions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is used in traditional herbal medicine. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its spread across arid environments."
