    "intro": "Maihuenia patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit enables it to spread and form dense mats across rocky and sandy soils. Maihuenia patagonica is also known for its ability to thrive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
