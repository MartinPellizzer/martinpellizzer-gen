    "intro": "Medyphylla rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf medyphylla, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
