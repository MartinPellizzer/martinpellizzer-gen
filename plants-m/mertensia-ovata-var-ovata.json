    "intro": "Mertensia ovata var. ovata, commonly known as bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, blue-green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it is noted for its aromatic foliage. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
