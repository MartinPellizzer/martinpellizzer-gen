    "intro": "Magnolia dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin, papery layers. The tree is relatively slow-growing and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade."
