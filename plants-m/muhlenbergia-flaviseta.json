    "intro": "Muhlenbergia flaviseta, commonly known as the golden muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and vibrant golden-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces feathery, silver-tan seed heads that add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance, it is often used in native plant gardens and erosion control."
