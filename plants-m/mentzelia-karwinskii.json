    "intro": "Mentzelia karwinskii, commonly known as the Karwinski's blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Mentzelia karwinskii is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its erect stem and clustered inflorescence."
