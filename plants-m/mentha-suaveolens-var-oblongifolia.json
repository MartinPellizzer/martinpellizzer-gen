    "intro": "Mentha suaveolens var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaved spearmint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. Its aromatic leaves emit a strong, minty scent due to the presence of menthol and other volatile oils. This variety is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses."
