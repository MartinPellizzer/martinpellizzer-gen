It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some regions."
