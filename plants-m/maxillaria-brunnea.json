    "intro": "Maxillaria brunnea, commonly known as the brown maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and brown. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are often clustered in loose racemes, and the sepals and petals are similar in shape, creating a symmetrical appearance. Maxillaria brunnea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
