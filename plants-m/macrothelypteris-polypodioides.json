    "intro": "Macrothelypteris polypodioides, commonly known as the giant leather fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping rootstock that supports its extensive frond system. Its fronds are typically divided into pinnae, which are lance-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
