It is a member of the Saxifragaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often along stream banks or in rich soil. Its leaves are usually oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters, adding a delicate ornamental value to the plant."
