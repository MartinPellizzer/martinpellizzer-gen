It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. Its stems are often woody and can branch out profusely, forming dense shrubs. The hairy mimosa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
