    "intro": "Mimosa barrancana, commonly known as the coastal mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Mexico and the southern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow flower clusters that appear in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal plains. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Mimosa barrancana is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
