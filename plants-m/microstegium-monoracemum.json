    "intro": "Microstegium monoracemum, commonly known as the single-stemmed wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Microstegium monoracemum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
