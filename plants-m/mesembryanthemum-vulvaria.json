    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum vulvaria, commonly known as the yellow mesem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Mesembryanthemum vulvaria is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
