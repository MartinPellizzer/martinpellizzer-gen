It features slender, upright stems with opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is characterized by a delicate, thread-like texture, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
