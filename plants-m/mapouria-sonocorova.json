    "intro": "Mapouria sonocorova, commonly known as the Sonora mapouria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. Its flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mapouria sonocorova is adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
