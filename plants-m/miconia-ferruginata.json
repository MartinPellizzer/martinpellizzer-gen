    "intro": "Miconia ferruginata, commonly known as the ironwood miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, round, orange-red fruits. Miconia ferruginata is known for its hard, dense wood, which has been used traditionally for construction and tool-making. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
