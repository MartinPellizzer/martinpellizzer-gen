    "intro": "Mesua lanceolata, commonly known as the Indian rose or flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral display, which appears in clusters during the spring. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. Mesua lanceolata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and garden cultivation."
