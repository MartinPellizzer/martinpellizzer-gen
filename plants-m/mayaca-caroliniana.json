    "intro": "Mayaca caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina mayapple, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive, umbrella-shaped leaf structure with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces a cluster of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in forest understories."
