    "intro": "Maclura zanthoxylon, commonly known as the yellow wood or honey locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately compound, and its distinctive yellow to orange bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by long, flat pods containing several seeds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness, and its wood is valued for its durability and unique coloration."
