    "intro": "Milium capillaceum, commonly known as the slender millet, is a small, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind. Milium capillaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine, grass-like appearance."
