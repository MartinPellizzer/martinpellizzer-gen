    "intro": "Malva maritima, commonly known as sea mallow, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dunes and coastal habitats. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in arid environments. Malva maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
