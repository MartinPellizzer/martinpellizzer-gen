It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically smooth and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of its distinctive, hard-shelled nuts. Its seeds are rich in oil and are valued for both culinary and industrial uses. The species is well adapted to warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
