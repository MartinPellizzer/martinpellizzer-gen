    "intro": "Microthlaspi natolicum, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. This species is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, often succulent leaves adapted to cold and arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of mountain ecosystems."
