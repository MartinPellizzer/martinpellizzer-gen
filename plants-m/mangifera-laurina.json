    "intro": "Mangifera laurina, commonly known as the wild mango or laurina mango, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically less palatable than cultivated mangoes but are used in traditional medicine. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties. Mangifera laurina thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests."
