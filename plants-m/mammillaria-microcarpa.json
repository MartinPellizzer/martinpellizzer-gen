    "intro": "Mammillaria microcarpa, commonly known as the miniature pincushion cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
