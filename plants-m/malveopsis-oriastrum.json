    "intro": "Malveopsis oriastrum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters tall, with erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Malveopsis oriastrum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
