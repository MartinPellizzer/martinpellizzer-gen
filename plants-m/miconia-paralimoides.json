It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Miconia paralimoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking foliage and floral display."
