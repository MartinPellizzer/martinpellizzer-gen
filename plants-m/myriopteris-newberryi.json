    "intro": "Myriopteris newberryi, commonly known as Newberry's huperbion, is a rare fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
