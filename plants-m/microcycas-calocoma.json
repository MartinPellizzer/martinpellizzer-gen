    "intro": "Microcycas calocoma, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Microcycas calocoma is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
