    "intro": "Marsdenia xerohylica, commonly known as the desert milkvine, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is a woody vine characterized by its long, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds. Marsdenia xerohylica is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots and a capacity to store water in its stems."
