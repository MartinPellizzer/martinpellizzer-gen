    "intro": "Microchilus erythrodoides subsp. erythrodoides, commonly known as the red-flowered microchilus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to Mediterranean climates."
