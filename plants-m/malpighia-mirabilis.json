    "intro": "Malpighia mirabilis, commonly known as the miracle fruit, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small shrub that produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are rich in vitamin C. The plant's leaves are elliptical and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and white with five petals. The fruit contains a unique compound called miraculin, which alters taste perception by making sour foods taste sweet. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit."
