    "intro": "Mammillaria plecostigma var. minor, commonly known as the miniature plecostigma, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with small, rounded tubercles that bear white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and compact size. Due to its delicate nature, it thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering."
