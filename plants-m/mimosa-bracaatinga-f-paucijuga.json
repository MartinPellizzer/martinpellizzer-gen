    "intro": "Mimosa bracaatinga f. paucijuga, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a variant of the Mimosa species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant responses to environmental stimuli."
