    "intro": "Myrciaria undulata, commonly known as the Brazilian gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested when they turn bright red, though they are often consumed when still slightly green. Myrciaria undulata thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas with well-drained soil. It is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of edible fruit."
