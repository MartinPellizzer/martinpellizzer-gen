    "intro": "Melocactus ingens, commonly known as the giant melon cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its massive, globular stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Melocactus ingens is also noted for its slow growth rate and unique ability to form a caudex, which helps it survive in harsh desert conditions."
