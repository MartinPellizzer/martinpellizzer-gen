    "intro": "Myriophyllum variifolium, commonly known as variable watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The leaves are often green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces tiny, floating flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. This plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds."
