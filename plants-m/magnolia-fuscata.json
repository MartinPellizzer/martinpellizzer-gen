    "intro": "Magnolia fuscata, commonly known as the gray magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The tree typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade."
