    "intro": "Malvastrum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Malvastrum glomeratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
