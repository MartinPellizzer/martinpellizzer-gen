    "intro": "Mespilus atrofusca, commonly known as the dark-leaf medlar, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that ripen in the fall, though they are not as widely cultivated as other medlar varieties. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with woody stems and a dense canopy of leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare botanical curiosity in certain regions of Europe."
