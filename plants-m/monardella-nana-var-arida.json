    "intro": "Monardella nana var. arida, commonly known as desert larkspur, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features dense clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
