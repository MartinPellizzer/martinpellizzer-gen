    "intro": "Miconia intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping due to its striking foliage. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
