    "intro": "Melaleuca nematophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, black seeds. It is adapted to saline and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Melaleuca nematophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and providing habitat for native wildlife."
