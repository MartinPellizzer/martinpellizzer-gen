    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. aquatica, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the mint family native to moist or aquatic environments. It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other waterlogged areas, where its preference for high humidity and nutrient-rich soils is satisfied. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often slightly aromatic. Its flowers are small, clustered in whorls, and produce a strong, minty scent. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
