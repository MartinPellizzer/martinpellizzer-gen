    "intro": "Marsilea mearnsii, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds perform photosynthesis. Marsilea mearnsii is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
