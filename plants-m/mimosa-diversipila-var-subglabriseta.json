    "intro": "Mimosa diversipila var. subglabriseta, commonly known as the smooth-leaved mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
