    "intro": "Mentha pulegium f. foetida, commonly known as narrow-leaf pennyroyal, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its small, narrow leaves and highly aromatic, often menthol-like scent. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers and is typically found in moist, shady environments. Its essential oils contain pulegone, which is toxic to livestock and can be harmful to humans if ingested. Due to its potent aroma and chemical composition, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
