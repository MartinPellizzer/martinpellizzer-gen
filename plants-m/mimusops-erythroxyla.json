    "intro": "Mimusops erythroxyla, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, round, yellow to orange fruits that contain a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, though it is now considered endangered due to overharvesting. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
