It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white ray flowers surrounded by yellow disk flowers, typical of the genus Microseris. It has a short, hairy stem and is often found in dry, rocky soils. The leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
