    "intro": "Maresia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-blue leaves, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature. Maresia's flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and its ornamental value."
