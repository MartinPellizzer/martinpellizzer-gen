    "intro": "Miconia pailasana, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a yellowish or reddish underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are a key feature of its botanical appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
