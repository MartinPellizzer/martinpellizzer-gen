    "intro": "Moquilea steudeliana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Moquilea steudeliana is often found growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils, demonstrating its resilience to harsh conditions."
