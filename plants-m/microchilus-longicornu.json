    "intro": "Microchilus longicornu, commonly known as the longhorned microchilus, is a small, delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. Its pollination is primarily carried out by specific species of bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
