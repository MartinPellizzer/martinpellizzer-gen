    "intro": "Mammillaria krameri, commonly known as the Krameri Hedgehog Cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are small, rounded growths. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its textured surface. It is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Mammillaria krameri is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
