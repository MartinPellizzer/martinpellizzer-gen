    "intro": "Miconia umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are arranged in an umbel, hence its common name. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds. Miconia umbellata is often found in moist, lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
