    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum subsp. velebiticum, commonly known as the Velebit yellowtop, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. This subspecies is native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly found in the Velebit Mountains of Croatia. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often forming dense colonies in its native range."
