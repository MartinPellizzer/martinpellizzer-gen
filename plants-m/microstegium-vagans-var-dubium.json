    "intro": "Microstegium vagans var. dubium, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The species is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats."
