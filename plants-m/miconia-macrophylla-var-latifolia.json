    "intro": "Miconia macrophylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in non-native environments."
