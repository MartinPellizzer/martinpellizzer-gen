    "intro": "Macrolobium ecoukense, commonly known as the West African giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's floating leaves are supported by long, spongy petioles that help it remain buoyant on the water's surface. Its flowers, which bloom in the early morning, are typically pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Macrolobium ecoukense plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by contributing to water filtration and providing shelter for aquatic life."
