It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it is an important species in ecological studies of drought-resistant flora."
