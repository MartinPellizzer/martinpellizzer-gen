    "intro": "Monstera lechleriana, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, deeply perforated leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its leaves can grow up to 1 meter in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange berries. Monstera lechleriana is popular as a houseplant due to its unique foliage and air-purifying qualities."
