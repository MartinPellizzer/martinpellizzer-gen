    "intro": "Maranta pilosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous root system is used to produce a starchy, edible root known as arrowroot. Maranta pilosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
