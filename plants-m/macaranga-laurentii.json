    "intro": "Macaranga laurentii, commonly known as the giant sterculia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is notable for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ecological versatility."
