    "intro": "Miconia clementiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
