    "intro": "Mammillaria gummifera var. macdougalii, commonly known as the MacDougal's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with a dense covering of white to pale green tubercles, each bearing a single, short, pale spine. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, requiring minimal water. Its unique appearance and compact size make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
