    "intro": "Malva pusilla, commonly known as the small mallows, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped, lobed, and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Malva pusilla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
