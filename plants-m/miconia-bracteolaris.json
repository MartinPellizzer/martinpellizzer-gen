    "intro": "Miconia bracteolaris, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features, including its hairy leaves and showy flowers, contribute to its ecological impact and ornamental appeal."
