    "intro": "Marathrum kerberi, commonly known as the Kerber's marathrum, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
