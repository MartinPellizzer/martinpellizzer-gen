    "intro": "Miconia ibaguensis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a large, fast-growing shrub or small tree that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
