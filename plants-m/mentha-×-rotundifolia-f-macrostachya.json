    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia f. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-leaved mint, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Mentha rotundifolia and other mint species. It is distinguished by its round, broad leaves and robust growth habit, which make it well-suited for cultivation in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in terminal spikes. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a source of aromatic foliage. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both garden landscapes and herbal applications."
