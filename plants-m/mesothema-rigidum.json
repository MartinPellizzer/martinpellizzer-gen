It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its leaves are rigid and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
