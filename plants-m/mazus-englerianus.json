    "intro": "Mazus englerianus, commonly known as the Engler's mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly serrated margin, and are often covered in fine pubescence. Mazus englerianus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
