    "intro": "Myriachaeta, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in cup-like clusters at the ends of its stems. Myriachaeta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and prairies. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
