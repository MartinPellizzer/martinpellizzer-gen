    "intro": "Melaleuca ebracteata var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish or brownish inner layer. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly waxy texture. This species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
