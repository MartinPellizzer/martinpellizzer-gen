    "intro": "Mida salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf mida, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, willow-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or woodland habitats. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
