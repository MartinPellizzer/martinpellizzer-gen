    "intro": "Miconia polygama, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a fleshy, purple drupe that contains several seeds. Miconia polygama is notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
