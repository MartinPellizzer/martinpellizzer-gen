It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree has simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
