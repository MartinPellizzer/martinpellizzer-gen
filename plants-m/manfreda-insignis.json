    "intro": "Manfreda insignis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stalks, making it a distinctive sight in desert landscapes. Manfreda insignis is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established."
