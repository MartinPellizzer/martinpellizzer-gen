It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its compact growth habit and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
