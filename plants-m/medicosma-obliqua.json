    "intro": "Medicosma obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are opposite and usually have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Medicosma obliqua is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in regions with low rainfall."
