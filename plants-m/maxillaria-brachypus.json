    "intro": "Maxillaria brachypus, commonly known as the short-stalked maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically has a pseudobulb with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are borne on short, erect peduncles. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria brachypus is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
