    "intro": "Mimosa podocarpa var. acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
