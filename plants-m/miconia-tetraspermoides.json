    "intro": "Miconia tetraspermoides, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible and contain numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
