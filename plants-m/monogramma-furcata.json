    "intro": "Monogramma furcata, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble the delicate structure of a maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clusters over time. The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year."
