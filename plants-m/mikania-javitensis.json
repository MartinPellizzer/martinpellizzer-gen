It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fast-growing vines and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are slender and often twining. Mikania javitensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
