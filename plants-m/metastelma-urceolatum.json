    "intro": "Metastelma urceolatum, commonly known as the cup-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a unique morphology characterized by its cup-shaped stem that encircles the host branch, from which it derives some of its nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
