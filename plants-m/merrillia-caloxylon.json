    "intro": "Merrillia caloxylon, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
