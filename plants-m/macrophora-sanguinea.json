    "intro": "Macrophora sanguinea, commonly known as the bloodwood tree, is a species native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, reddish-brown bark that exudes a resinous sap, which can be toxic to some animals. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture. The flowers are small and greenish-white, and the tree produces woody pods containing seeds."
