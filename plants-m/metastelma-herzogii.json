    "intro": "Metastelma herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's metaphytes, is a rare flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Pedaliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open grasslands and along the edges of shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
