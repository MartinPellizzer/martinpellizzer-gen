    "intro": "Maurocenia frangula, commonly known as the European ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and compound leaves with opposite arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. However, it is vulnerable to ash dieback disease, which has significantly impacted its populations in recent decades."
