It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release numerous small, winged seeds. Miconia dolichorrhyncha is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
