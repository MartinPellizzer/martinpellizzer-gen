    "intro": "Malus beauvaisiensis, commonly known as the Beauvais pear, is a rare and ancient species of apple tree native to France. It is characterized by its small, sweet, and aromatic fruits that are typically yellow or golden in color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive pome fruits. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts."
