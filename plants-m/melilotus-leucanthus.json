    "intro": "Melilotus leucanthus, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. White sweet clover is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop in agriculture."
