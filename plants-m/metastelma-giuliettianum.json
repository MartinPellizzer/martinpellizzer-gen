    "intro": "Metastelma giuliettianum, commonly known as the Juliette's metastelma, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with four petals and prominent stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
