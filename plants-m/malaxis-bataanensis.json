    "intro": "Malaxis bataanensis, commonly known as the Bataan ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research. Conservation efforts are critical due to habitat loss and illegal collection."
