    "intro": "Menziesia multiflora var. longicalyx, commonly known as the long-leaf menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. This variety is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to the typical form of Menziesia multiflora."
