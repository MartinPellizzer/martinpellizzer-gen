The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and its flowers are pale yellow to white, often surrounded by bracts that give the appearance of a single bloom. Marshallia tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
