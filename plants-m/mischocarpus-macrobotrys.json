    "intro": "Mischocarpus macrobotrys, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed, and it is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued in musical instrument making. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
