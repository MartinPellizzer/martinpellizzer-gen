    "intro": "Medicago sativa subsp. falcata, commonly known as Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used for forage and soil nitrogen fixation due to its ability to form symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and ecological traits compared to other Medicago species."
