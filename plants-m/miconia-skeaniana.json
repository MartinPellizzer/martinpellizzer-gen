    "intro": "Miconia skeaniana, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves, and small white flowers that bloom in clusters. Miconia skeaniana is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is also notable for its potential role in ecological systems, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
