    "intro": "Melica interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each branch, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. Melica interrupta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
