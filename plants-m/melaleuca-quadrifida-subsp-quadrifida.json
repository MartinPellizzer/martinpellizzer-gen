    "intro": "Melaleuca quadrifida subsp. quadrifida, commonly known as the broadleaf paperbark, is a species of shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a reddish or yellowish underside. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of northern Australia."
