    "intro": "Micropiper convexum, commonly known as the convex pipevine, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters along the stems. Micropiper convexum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
