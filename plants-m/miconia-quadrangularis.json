    "intro": "Miconia quadrangularis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or purple miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and purple underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
