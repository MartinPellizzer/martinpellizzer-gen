    "intro": "Marcgravia strenua, commonly known as the climbing bromeliad, is a species native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a vine-like plant that uses its aerial roots to climb trees, often forming dense foliage along its host. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped inflorescences that are typically green or yellowish, with showy bracts. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, which help in capturing moisture from the air. Marcgravia strenua is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in supporting various epiphytic organisms."
