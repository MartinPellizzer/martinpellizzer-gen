    "intro": "Modecca repanda, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, reddish bark and lance-shaped leaves. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its natural habitat."
