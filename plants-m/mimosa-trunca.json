    "intro": "Mimosa trunca, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically hairy and can grow up to several feet in height. Mimosa trunca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptive responses."
