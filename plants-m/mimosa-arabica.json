    "intro": "Mimosa arabica, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun. Mimosa arabica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate appearance."
