    "intro": "Mentha gracilescens, commonly known as slender mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thin, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Mentha gracilescens is typically found in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
