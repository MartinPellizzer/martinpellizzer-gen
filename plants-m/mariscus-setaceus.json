    "intro": "Mariscus setaceus, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 centimeters and features delicate, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Mariscus setaceus plays an important role in supporting local insect populations and is a characteristic species of its native habitat."
