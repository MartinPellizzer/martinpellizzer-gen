It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in dry and disturbed soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, aiding in its propagation. Medicago leonis is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
