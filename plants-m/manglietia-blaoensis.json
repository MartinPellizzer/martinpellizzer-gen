    "intro": "Manglietia blaoensis, commonly known as the Blao manglietia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of southern China. It belongs to the family Magnoliaceae, which includes some of the oldest known flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
