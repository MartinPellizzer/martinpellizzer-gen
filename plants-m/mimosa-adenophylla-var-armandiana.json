    "intro": "Mimosa adenophylla var. armandiana, commonly known as the Armand's sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its unique sensitivity to touch and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collections."
