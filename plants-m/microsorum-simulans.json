    "intro": "Microsorum simulans, commonly known as the lesser panda plant, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive light green and white variegation pattern. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form a dense mat, which helps stabilize sediments and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum simulans is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
