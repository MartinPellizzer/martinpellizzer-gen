    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to wet, acidic habitats in northern Europe. It features narrow, blue-green leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical Molinia caerulea. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
