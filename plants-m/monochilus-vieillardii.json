It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight."
