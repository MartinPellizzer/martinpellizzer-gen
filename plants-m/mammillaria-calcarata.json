    "intro": "Mammillaria calcarata, commonly known as the rock spurge cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
