    "intro": "Miconia alboviridis, commonly known as the white-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, attracting various bird species. Miconia alboviridis is often found in humid lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
