    "intro": "Mammillaria phantasma, commonly known as the phantom mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive white, woolly spines and small, pale green stems that often appear almost ghostly. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare cacti."
