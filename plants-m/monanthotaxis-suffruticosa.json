    "intro": "Monanthotaxis suffruticosa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
