    "intro": "Manisuris fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and swampy areas. The plant features a rhizomatous stem system, which allows it to spread and form dense clusters. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The plant is valued for its edible tubers, which are similar in texture to yams and are used in local cuisines."
