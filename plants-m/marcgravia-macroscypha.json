    "intro": "Marcgravia macroscypha, commonly known as the giant waterwheel vine, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its unique aerial roots help it anchor to trees, while its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. Marcgravia macroscypha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
