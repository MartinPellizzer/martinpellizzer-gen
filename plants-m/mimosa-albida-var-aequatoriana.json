It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in spherical clusters, and it produces pods that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and unique leaf response."
