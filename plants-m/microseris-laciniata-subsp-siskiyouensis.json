    "intro": "Microseris laciniata subsp. siskiyouensis, commonly known as the Siskiyou biscuit flower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in open meadows and along stream banks. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its more finely divided leaves and slightly different flower structure compared to other subspecies of Microseris."
