    "intro": "Matthiola sinuata subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, bushy growth with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a slightly sticky texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
