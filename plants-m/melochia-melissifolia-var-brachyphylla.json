The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, often followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
