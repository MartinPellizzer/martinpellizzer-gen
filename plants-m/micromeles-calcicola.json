    "intro": "Micromeles calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lily, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in calcareous soils, typically found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a shallow root system to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Micromeles calcicola is considered endangered in many areas."
