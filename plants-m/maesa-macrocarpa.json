    "intro": "Maesa macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited maesa, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clustered flowers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Maesa macrocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
