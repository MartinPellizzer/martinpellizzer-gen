    "intro": "Mariscus clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
