    "intro": "Myrica caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, wax-coated berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Myrica caroliniana is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is used in ornamental horticulture."
