    "intro": "Mollinedia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf mollinedia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its foliage is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, woodland environments. Mollinedia lanceolata is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
