It is characterized by its slender, nearly stemless stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
