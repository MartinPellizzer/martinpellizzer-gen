    "intro": "Miconia velutina, commonly known as velvet miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia velutina is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
