    "intro": "Macrothelypteris dianae, commonly known as the Dianae huperbole, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
