    "intro": "Mascagnia polycarpa, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and can survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to conserve water through its thick, waxy leaves. Mascagnia polycarpa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
