    "intro": "Myrtus limbata, commonly known as the narrowleaf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features aromatic, narrow elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. Its fruit is a small, dark blue to black berry that contains several seeds. Myrtus limbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance."
