It has small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are typically small and feathery, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics."
