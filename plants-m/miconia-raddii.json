    "intro": "Miconia raddii, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, where it can become invasive."
