    "intro": "Microsorum commutatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the substrate, helping to stabilize the aquatic ecosystem. Microsorum commutatum is popular in aquascaping due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
