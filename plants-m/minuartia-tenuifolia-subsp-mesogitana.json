    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia subsp. mesogitana, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small white or pale pink flowers. It is native to rocky and sandy soils in Mediterranean climates, particularly in regions of southern Europe and North Africa. The plant typically forms dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and rocky habitats."
