It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery or white underside, which helps reflect light in low-light conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and range in color from purple to white, depending on the variety. Monelasmum discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
