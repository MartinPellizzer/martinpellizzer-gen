    "intro": "Melaleuca citrolens, commonly known as the lemon myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that are rich in citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain numerous small, oval seeds. Melaleuca citrolens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the essential oils extracted from its leaves."
