    "intro": "Microlicia hatschbachii, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is a small, slow-growing cycad with a short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
