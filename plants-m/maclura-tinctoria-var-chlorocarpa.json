    "intro": "Maclura tinctoria var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-fruited pokeweed, is a variant of the pokeweed species native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its thick, rough bark and alternate, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by green, fleshy berries that mature to a yellowish-orange color. Its leaves and berries contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though with caution."
