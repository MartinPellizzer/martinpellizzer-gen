    "intro": "Merremia calycina, commonly known as the velvet leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
