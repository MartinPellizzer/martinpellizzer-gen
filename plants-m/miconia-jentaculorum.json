    "intro": "Miconia jentaculorum, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often veined with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
