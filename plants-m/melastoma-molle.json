It is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving off a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Melastoma molle is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
