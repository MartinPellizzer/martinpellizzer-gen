    "intro": "Montia rivularis var. lamprosperma, commonly known as the silverleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, rocky habitats in western North America. It features delicate, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in streambanks and wet meadows. This variety is closely related to other Montia species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
