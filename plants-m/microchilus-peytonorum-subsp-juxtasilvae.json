    "intro": "Microchilus peytonorum subsp. juxtasilvae, commonly known as the silverleaf microchilus, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
