    "intro": "Medicago lupulina f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth balsamgrass, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
