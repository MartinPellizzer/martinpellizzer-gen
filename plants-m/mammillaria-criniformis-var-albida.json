    "intro": "Mammillaria criniformis var. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
