    "intro": "Mammillaria neopotosina, commonly known as the Potosi hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
