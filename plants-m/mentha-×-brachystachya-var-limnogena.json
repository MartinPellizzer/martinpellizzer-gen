It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and spikes of pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. Its leaves are widely used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties.
