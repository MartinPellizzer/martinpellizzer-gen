    "intro": "Malus dasyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its rugged, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small, yellowish apple, is edible but not as commonly consumed as other apple varieties. The rough-leaved apple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
