    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. riparia, commonly known as the riparian needlepod, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and other riparian habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in stabilizing soil and supporting other plant life."
