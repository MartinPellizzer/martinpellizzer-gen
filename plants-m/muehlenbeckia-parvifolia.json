    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved muhlenbeckia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to South America. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a soft, velvety texture and a distinctive silver-gray hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
