    "intro": "Meliosma ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's meliosma, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
