It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and leathery, glossy leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
