    "intro": "Muscarella bota-caucanensis, commonly known as the Cauca mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
