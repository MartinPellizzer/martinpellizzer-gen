    "intro": "Micranthocereus flaviflorus subsp. flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. This subsp. is notable for its compact size and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
