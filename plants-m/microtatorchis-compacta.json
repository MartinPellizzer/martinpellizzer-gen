    "intro": "Microtatorchis compacta, commonly known as the compact dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a short, fleshy rhizome and produces compact, clustered pseudobulbs that support its delicate, narrow leaves. The plant blooms with small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
