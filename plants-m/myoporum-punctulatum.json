    "intro": "Myoporum punctulatum, commonly known as the silverleaf myoporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white to greyish pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by blue or purple berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Myoporum punctulatum is also valued for its use in landscaping and as a hedge plant due to its hardiness and adaptability."
