    "intro": "Meriania phlomoides, commonly known as the Florida starling tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or orange when mature, containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
