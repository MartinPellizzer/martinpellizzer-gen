    "intro": "Meliosma lepidota subsp. vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic meliosma, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude volcanic regions. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its growth is closely tied to the unique microclimates found in volcanic soils, which provide essential nutrients and moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
