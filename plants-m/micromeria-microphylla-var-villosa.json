    "intro": "Micromeria microphylla var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy micromeria, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch of color to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
