    "intro": "Mentha hystrix, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters. Mentha hystrix thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive benefits."
