    "intro": "Macrochiton forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and a distinctive, often brightly colored mantle. This marine gastropod is found in temperate coastal waters, typically in shallow rocky habitats. Its diet consists mainly of algae, which it grazes upon using its radula. The species is notable for its ability to secrete a mucus that aids in locomotion and defense."
