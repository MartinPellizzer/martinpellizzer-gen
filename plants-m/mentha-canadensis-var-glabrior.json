    "intro": "Mentha canadensis var. glabrior, commonly known as Canadian mint or narrow-leaf mint, is a variant of the native American mint species. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and square stems typical of the Lamiaceae family. The leaves are generally narrower and have a smoother texture compared to other Mentha species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas across eastern North America. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological value as a nectar source for pollinators."
