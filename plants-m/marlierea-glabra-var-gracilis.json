    "intro": "Marlierea glabra var. gracilis, commonly known as slender velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings."
