    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. risibilis, commonly known as the round-leaf mint, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Mentha rotundifolia and Mentha \u00d7 piperita. It is distinguished by its rounded, somewhat heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, typically in late summer. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its aromatic leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other mint species."
