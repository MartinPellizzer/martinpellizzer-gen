    "intro": "Mimulus clivicola, commonly known as the cliff's mimulus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky and coastal habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. The plant produces striking orange to yellow flowers with a distinctive bilabiate structure, typical of the Physopleuris genus. It is adapted to harsh environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Mimulus clivicola plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native range."
