    "intro": "Miconia paniculata, commonly known as the purple miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are often surrounded by prominent bracts. These bracts are typically bright red or purple, giving the plant its striking visual appearance. Miconia paniculata is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
