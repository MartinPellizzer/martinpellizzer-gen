    "intro": "Morelosia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly morelosia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
