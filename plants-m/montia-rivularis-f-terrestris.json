    "intro": "Montia rivularis f. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping water bladder, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to moist, rocky habitats. It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in its preferred environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in streamside areas. This variant is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit, making it well-suited for wetland ecosystems."
