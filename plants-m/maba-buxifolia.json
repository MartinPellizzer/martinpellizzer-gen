    "intro": "Maba buxifolia, commonly known as the African boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Maba buxifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
