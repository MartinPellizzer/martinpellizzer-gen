    "intro": "Mercurialis sylvestris, commonly known as the wild mercury or forest mercury, is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It contains toxic compounds, including mercury compounds, which contribute to its common name and its historical use in medicine and alchemy. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated and requires careful handling."
