    "intro": "Mariscus laevis, commonly known as the smooth marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 centimeters in height, covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating on the water's surface or growing from the mud. Mariscus laevis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
