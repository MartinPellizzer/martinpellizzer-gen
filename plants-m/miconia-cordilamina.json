    "intro": "Miconia cordilamina, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant, though caution is advised due to its ecological impact."
