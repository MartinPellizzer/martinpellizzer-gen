    "intro": "Mertensia longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring. The plant's most distinctive feature is its elongated, slender style that protrudes from the flower, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Mertensia longistyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
