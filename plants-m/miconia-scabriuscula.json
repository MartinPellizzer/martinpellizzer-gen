    "intro": "Miconia scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia scabriuscula is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
