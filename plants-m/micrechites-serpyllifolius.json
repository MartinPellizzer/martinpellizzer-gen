    "intro": "Micrechites serpyllifolius, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has fine, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Micrechites serpyllifolius is also known for its ability to tolerate environmental stress, making it a resilient species in various habitats."
