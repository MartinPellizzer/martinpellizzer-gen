    "intro": "Mimusops subsericea, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental horticulture."
