It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
