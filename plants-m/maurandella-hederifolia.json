It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
