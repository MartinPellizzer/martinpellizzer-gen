    "intro": "Marsippospermum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, including Marsippospermum africanum. The plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is exuded from the stems and leaves when damaged. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with thick, woody stems and alternate leaves. The flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
