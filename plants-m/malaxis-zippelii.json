    "intro": "Malaxis zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its rhizome is short and produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves. The flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
