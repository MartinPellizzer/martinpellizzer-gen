It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is native to certain regions of South America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
