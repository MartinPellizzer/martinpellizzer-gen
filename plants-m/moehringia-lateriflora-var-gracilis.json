The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its slender leaves and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native environment. It is often found in association with other alpine flora, contributing to the biodiversity of high-elevation ecosystems."
