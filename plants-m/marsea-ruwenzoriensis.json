    "intro": "Marsea ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori marsea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species for studying alpine flora in East Africa."
