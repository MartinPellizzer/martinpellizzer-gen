    "intro": "Maihuenia cumulata, commonly known as the Andean moss or cushion plant, is a unique succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Maihuenia cumulata is well adapted to extreme conditions, thriving in rocky soils and cold, high-altitude climates."
