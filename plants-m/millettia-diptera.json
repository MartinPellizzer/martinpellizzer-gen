    "intro": "Millettia diptera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has pinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
