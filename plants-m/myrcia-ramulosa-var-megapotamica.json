    "intro": "Myrcia ramulosa var. megapotamica, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverine habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
