It features slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by small, triangular pods containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
