    "intro": "Monarrhenus, commonly known as the single-stemmed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect, unbranched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes, with a distinctive pea-like shape. Monarrhenus species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. These plants play a role in soil stabilization and provide forage for livestock in certain regions."
