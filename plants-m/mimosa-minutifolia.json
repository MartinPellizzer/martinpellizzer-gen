    "intro": "Mimosa minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a small, herbaceous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique behavior and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its interesting botanical traits."
