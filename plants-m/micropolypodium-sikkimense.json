    "intro": "Micropolypodium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim polypody, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Micropolypodium sikkimense is native to the Himalayan region, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan."
