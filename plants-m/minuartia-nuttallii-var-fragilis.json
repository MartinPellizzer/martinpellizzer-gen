    "intro": "Minuartia nuttallii var. fragilis, commonly known as the fragile sandflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, featuring a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its fragility and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
