    "intro": "Manihot esculenta var. nodosa, commonly known as the swollen manioc or bitter manioc, is a variant of the manioc plant native to tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its swollen, starchy roots that are rich in carbohydrates but contain toxic cyanogenic glycosides. The leaves are typically large and heart-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinct odor. The plant is cultivated for its edible roots, which require processing to remove harmful compounds before consumption. It plays an important role in the diet and agriculture of many communities in the tropics."
