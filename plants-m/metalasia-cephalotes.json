    "intro": "Metalasia cephalotes, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from white to pink, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in humid conditions."
