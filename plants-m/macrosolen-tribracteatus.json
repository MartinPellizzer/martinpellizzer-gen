    "intro": "Macrosolen tribracteatus, commonly known as the golden torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has three bracts at the base of each flower, giving it its scientific name. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
