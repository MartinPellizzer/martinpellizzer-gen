It features a globular shape with a greenish-gray stem covered in white, waxy tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
