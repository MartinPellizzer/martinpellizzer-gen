    "intro": "Micromeria lanata, commonly known as the woolly micromeria, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy, and often glandular leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Micromeria lanata is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments."
