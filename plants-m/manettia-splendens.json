    "intro": "Manettia splendens, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and typically grows as a shrub or vine, attaching itself to host trees for nutrients. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
