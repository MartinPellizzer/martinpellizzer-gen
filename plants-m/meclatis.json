It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to various soil types. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces woody fruits that contain seeds. Meclatis is often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic value."
