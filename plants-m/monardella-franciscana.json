It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant typically grows in rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions.

Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
