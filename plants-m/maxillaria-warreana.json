It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing a pseudobulb with a single leaf. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive green or red lip. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
