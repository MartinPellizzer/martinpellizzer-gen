    "intro": "Mimosa montana, commonly known as the mountain mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, grayish seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Mimosa montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
