    "intro": "Mimosa parviceps, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa parviceps is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ease of care."
