    "intro": "Medicago difalcata, commonly known as the two-lobed medic, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Medicago difalcata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
