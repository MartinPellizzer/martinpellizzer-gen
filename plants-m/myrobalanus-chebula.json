    "intro": "Myrobalanus chebula, commonly known as chebuli or Indian hardy fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn from green to red or orange when mature. Its fruits are rich in tannins and have been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for their astringent and antioxidant properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic features."
