    "intro": "Monolophus phutokensis, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spire-like inflorescence that bears clusters of golden-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Monolophus phutokensis is considered an endangered species."
