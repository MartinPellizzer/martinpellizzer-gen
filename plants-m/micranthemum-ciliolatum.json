    "intro": "Micranthemum ciliolatum, commonly known as the creeping watermint, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize the substrate. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a soft, velvety texture and tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in ponds due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. Micranthemum ciliolatum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
