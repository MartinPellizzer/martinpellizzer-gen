    "intro": "Muscari carpaticum, commonly known as the Persian grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It produces dense clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that resemble small grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-20 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is a cold-hardy species that blooms in early spring, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early flowering and the subtle, musky scent that accompanies its blooms."
