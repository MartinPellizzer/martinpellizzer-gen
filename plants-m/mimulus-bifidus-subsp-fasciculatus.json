    "intro": "Mimulus bifidus subsp. fasciculatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features slender, branching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. Its showy, orange to yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact inflorescence compared to other Mimulus species."
