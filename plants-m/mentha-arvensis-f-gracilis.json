    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. gracilis, commonly known as slender field mint, is a subspecies of the broadleaf mint plant. It is characterized by its slender stems and smaller, lance-shaped leaves compared to the typical form of Mentha arvensis. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The essential oils of this subspecies are similar to those of other mints, containing compounds like menthol and limonene."
