    "intro": "Myosotis scorpioides var. lithospermifolia, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, adapting to cold and high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is closely related to other members of the Myosotis genus, sharing similar morphological traits."
