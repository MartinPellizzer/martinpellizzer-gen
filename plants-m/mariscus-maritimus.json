    "intro": "Mariscus maritimus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, silver-gray leaves and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its adaptations include a deep root system to access moisture and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Mariscus maritimus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
