    "intro": "Megalachne masafuerana, commonly known as the Masafuera grass, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its foliage is narrow and often displays a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Megalachne masafuerana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
