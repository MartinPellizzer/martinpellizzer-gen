    "intro": "Mutisiopersea brenesii, commonly known as the Costa Rican persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
