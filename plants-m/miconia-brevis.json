    "intro": "Miconia brevis, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries. Miconia brevis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and impact on native ecosystems."
