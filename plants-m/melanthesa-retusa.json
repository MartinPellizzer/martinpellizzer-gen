    "intro": "Melanthesa retusa, commonly known as the smooth milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and lack hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Melanthesa retusa plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
