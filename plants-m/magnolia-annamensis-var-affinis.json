    "intro": "Magnolia annamensis var. affinis, commonly known as the Annam magnolia, is a rare and lesser-known species native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
