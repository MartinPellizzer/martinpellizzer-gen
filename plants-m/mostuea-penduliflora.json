The plant produces long, pendant inflorescences that bear small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Mostuea penduliflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
