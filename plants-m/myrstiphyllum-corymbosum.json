    "intro": "Myrstiphyllum corymbosum, commonly known as the New Zealand whitebeam, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Myrstiphyllum corymbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native ecosystems."
