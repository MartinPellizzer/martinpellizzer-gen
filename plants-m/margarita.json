    "intro": "Margarita, commonly known as the margarita plant, is a member of the Agavaceae family, which includes other succulent plants like aloe and agave. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features a thick, spiky stem with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically yellow or green and bloom in the summer. While not widely cultivated for its foliage, it is sometimes grown for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
