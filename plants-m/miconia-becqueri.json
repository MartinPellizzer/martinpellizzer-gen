    "intro": "Miconia becqueri, commonly known as the Ecuadorian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, pentagonal leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 800 and 2,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
