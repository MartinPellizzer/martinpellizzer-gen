    "intro": "Megema vidua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a unique, almost translucent appearance. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat destruction and its low reproductive rate, Megema vidua is considered critically endangered."
