    "intro": "Minuartia imbricata var. koreana, commonly known as the Korean rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Korea. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family."
