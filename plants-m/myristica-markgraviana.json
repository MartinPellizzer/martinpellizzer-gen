    "intro": "Myristica markgraviana, commonly known as the Maluku nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen belonging to the Myristicaceae family. It is native to the Moluccas (formerly the Spice Islands) in Indonesia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and develops aromatic, ellipsoid fruits that contain a single seed. Its seeds are encased in a reddish outer layer and a white, oily inner part, both of which are used in traditional medicine and as spices. The tree is valued for its essential oils, which have been historically used in perfumery and as a flavoring agent."
