    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna subvar. filicifolia, commonly known as the filicifolia whitebeam, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that resemble fern fronds, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in late summer. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, wooded habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
