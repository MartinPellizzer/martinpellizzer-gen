    "intro": "Medicago suffruticosa var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan clover, is a perennial legume native to North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like habit with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in soil fixation due to its ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on its roots. This variety is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
