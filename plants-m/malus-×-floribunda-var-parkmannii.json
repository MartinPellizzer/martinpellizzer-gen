    "intro": "Malus \u00d7 floribunda var. parkmannii, commonly known as the Parkmann's flowering crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The fruit is a small, yellow or red apple-like pome, which is typically not edible for humans but is used in ornamental horticulture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its showy spring display."
