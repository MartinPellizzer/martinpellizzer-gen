    "intro": "Melochia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky mallow, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Melochia mollis is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
