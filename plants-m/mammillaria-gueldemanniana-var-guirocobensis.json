    "intro": "Mammillaria gueldemanniana var. guirocobensis, commonly known as the Guirocobensis mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with dense, white to pale yellow spines and small, rounded areoles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
