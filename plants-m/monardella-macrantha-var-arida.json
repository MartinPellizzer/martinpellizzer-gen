    "intro": "Monardella macrantha var. arida, commonly known as desert larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Due to its low water requirements, it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
