    "intro": "Malcolmia cossoniana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
