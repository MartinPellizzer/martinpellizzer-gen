    "intro": "Momordica grosvenorii, commonly known as the Grosvenor bitter gourd, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces elongated, bitter-tasting fruits that are typically harvested when young and tender. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other bitter gourd varieties."
