    "intro": "Madhuca rupicola, commonly known as the rock madhuca, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
