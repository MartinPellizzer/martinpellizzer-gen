    "intro": "Microlaelia lundii, commonly known as the Lund's microlaelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
