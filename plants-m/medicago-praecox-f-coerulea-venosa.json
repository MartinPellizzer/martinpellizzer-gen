    "intro": "Medicago praecox f. coerulea-venosa, commonly known as the blue-veined clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinct blue-veined pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It is typically found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
