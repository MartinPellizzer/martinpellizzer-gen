    "intro": "Mammillaria dioica var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, rounded stems that are often covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
