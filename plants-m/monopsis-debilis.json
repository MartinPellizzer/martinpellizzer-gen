    "intro": "Monopsis debilis, commonly known as the weak monopsis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid regions. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
