    "intro": "Mimosa suberosa, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mimosa suberosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. It is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
