    "intro": "Marginaria catharinae, commonly known as the Catherine's marginaria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring, producing clusters of pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Marginaria catharinae is considered a vulnerable species."
