    "intro": "Malcolmia castellana, commonly known as the rock mallows, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
