    "intro": "Myrtus styphelioides, commonly known as the silver myrtle or coastal myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a dark purple color. Myrtus styphelioides is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
