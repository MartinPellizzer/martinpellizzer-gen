    "intro": "Mentzelia peirsonii, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often hairy and narrow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mentzelia peirsonii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators like moths."
