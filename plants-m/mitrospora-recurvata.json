    "intro": "Mitrospora recurvata, commonly known as the recurved mitrospora, is a species of fungi that belongs to the family Microascaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark, and globose to subglobose ascospores, which are typically 14\u201320 micrometers in diameter. The plant forms its spores within ascocarps, which are cup-shaped and often reddish-brown in color. It is commonly found on decaying wood and other organic substrates in forested areas. Due to its microscopic size and specific habitat, it is not widely studied but plays a role in the decomposition process in its ecosystem."
