    "intro": "Monnina arbuscula, commonly known as the red sandreed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Monnina arbuscula is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
