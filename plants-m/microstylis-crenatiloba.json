It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly wavy or toothed edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of many grass species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Microstylis crenatiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
