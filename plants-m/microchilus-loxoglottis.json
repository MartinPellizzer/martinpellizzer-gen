    "intro": "Microchilus loxoglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the Andes of South America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. The plant features a compact, mat-like growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, and it is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its specialized environment, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species among orchid enthusiasts."
