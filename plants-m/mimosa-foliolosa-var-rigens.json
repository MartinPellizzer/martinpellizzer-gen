    "intro": "Mimosa foliolosa var. rigens, commonly known as the rigid mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often appear in pairs. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can be both beneficial and invasive depending on the environment."
