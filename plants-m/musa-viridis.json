    "intro": "Musa viridis, commonly known as the green banana plant, is a species of banana native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant that grows in tropical climates, characterized by its large, broad leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces fruit that is typically harvested before it fully ripens, resulting in a starchy, green fruit. Musa viridis is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and agricultural significance. Its cultivation requires warm temperatures, high humidity, and well-drained soil to thrive."
