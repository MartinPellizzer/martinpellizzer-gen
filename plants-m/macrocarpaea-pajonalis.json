    "intro": "Macrocarpaea pajonalis, commonly known as the Pajonales alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps protect it from intense sunlight. Macrocarpaea pajonalis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine environments."
