    "intro": "Macrosiphonia balansae, commonly known as the Balansae liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and mat-forming. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead absorbs nutrients through its entire surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rock surfaces. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a indicator species for undisturbed habitats."
