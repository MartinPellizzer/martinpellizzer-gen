    "intro": "Moquilea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, woody pods that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it is often found in dune ecosystems. Moquilea macrocarpa plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing food for local wildlife."
