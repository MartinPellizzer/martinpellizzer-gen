    "intro": "Mimosa serpens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mimosa serpens is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful plant in some contexts and a potential invasive species in others."
