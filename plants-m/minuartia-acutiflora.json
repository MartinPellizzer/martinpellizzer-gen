    "intro": "Minuartia acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Minuartia acutiflora is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
