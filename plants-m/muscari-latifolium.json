    "intro": "Muscari latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are broader than those of other muscari species, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Muscari latifolium is also valued for its fragrant blooms and its ability to naturalize over time."
