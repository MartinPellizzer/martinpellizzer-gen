    "intro": "Maxillaria citrinilabia, commonly known as the lemon-scented maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs covered in smooth, waxy leaves. Its flowers are typically borne on racemes and have a unique, lemon-like scent. Maxillaria citrinilabia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
