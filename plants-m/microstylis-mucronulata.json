    "intro": "Microstylis mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-styled marsh orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a small, terrestrial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often in temperate regions. The plant features slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, narrow spur. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. Microstylis mucronulata is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution."
