    "intro": "Mammillaria columbiana var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 mammillaria, is a small cactus native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It features a globular or slightly cylindrical stem covered in white to pale blue tubercles, which are often adorned with radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its grayish-green body. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in full sun with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts and conservationists."
