    "intro": "Miconia echinata, commonly known as the spiny miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia echinata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
