    "intro": "Machaerium quinata var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered machaerium, is a tropical leguminous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
