    "intro": "Medicago arcuata, commonly known as the curled medic or curly vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive curled leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Medicago arcuata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
