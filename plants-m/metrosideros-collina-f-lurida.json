    "intro": "Metrosideros collina f. lurida, commonly known as the Grey Metrosideros, is a variant of the common pohutukawa or kahikatea. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand, characterized by its pale greyish-green foliage. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture. It produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. This form is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and pale coloration compared to the typical form of Metrosideros collina."
