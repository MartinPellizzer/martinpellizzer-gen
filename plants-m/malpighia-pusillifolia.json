    "intro": "Malpighia pusillifolia, commonly known as the dwarf wax apple, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into bright red, fleshy berries, which are edible and have a tart, sweet flavor. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens and is also used in traditional medicine."
