    "intro": "Miconia flaccida, commonly known as the soft miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, winged seeds when mature. Miconia flaccida is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and can become invasive in certain regions."
