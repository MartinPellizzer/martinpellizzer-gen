    "intro": "Micropus erectus, commonly known as the erect spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its latex is milky and can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. Micropus erectus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
