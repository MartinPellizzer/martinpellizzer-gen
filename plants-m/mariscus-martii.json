    "intro": "Mariscus martii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Mariscus martii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
