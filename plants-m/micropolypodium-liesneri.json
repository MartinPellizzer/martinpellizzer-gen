    "intro": "Micropolypodium liesneri, commonly known as the Liebner's polypody, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Micropolypodium liesneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
