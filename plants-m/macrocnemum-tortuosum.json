    "intro": "Macrocnemum tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted heartleaf, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a waxy texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, which are typically hidden beneath the foliage. Macrocnemum tortuosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
