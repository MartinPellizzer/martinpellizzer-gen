It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and distinctive, fluffy seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Muhlenbergia squarrosa plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
