    "intro": "Melampyrum hoermannianum subsp. bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest edges. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with two lips and five stamens, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in association with specific tree species like oaks and birches."
