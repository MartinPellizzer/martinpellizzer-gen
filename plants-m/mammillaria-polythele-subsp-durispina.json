    "intro": "Mammillaria polythele subsp. durispina, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a small cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, radial spines and prominent areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
