    "intro": "Miconia fluminensis, commonly known as the river miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is known for its rapid growth. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
