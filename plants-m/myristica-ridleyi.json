    "intro": "Myristica ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley nutmeg, is a species of flowering plant in the Myristicaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. The seeds within the fruit are encased in a hard, aromatic shell, which is the source of its commercial value. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
