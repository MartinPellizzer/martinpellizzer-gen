    "intro": "Machaerina brevipaniculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved machaerina, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or rocky soils. It is a shrub that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with woody stems and a compact growth habit.
