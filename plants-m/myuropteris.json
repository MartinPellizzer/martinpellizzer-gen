    "intro": "Myuropteris, commonly known as the golden fern, is a genus of ferns native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often golden or variegated in color. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Myuropteris species have a rhizomatous growth habit and produce spores in small, clustered sori on the underside of their fronds. These ferns are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
