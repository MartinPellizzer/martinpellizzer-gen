    "intro": "Manotes altiscandens, commonly known as the mountain spireflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Manotes altiscandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
