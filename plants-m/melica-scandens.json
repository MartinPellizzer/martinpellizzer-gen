The plant produces small, greenish to brownish spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface. Melica scandens is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges."
