It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. Its multicaulis form refers to its multiple stems, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological adaptation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
