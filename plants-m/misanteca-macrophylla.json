    "intro": "Misanteca macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters while its leaves float on the surface. Misanteca macrophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and maintaining water quality."
