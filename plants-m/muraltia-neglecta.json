    "intro": "Muraltia neglecta, commonly known as the dwarf coffee tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many coffee species, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
