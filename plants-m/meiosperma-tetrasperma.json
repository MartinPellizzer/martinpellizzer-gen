It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Meiosperma tetrasperma is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed and sandy soils."
