    "intro": "Mimosa carisquis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its unique leaf movements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
