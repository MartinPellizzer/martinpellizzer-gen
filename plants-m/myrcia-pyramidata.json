    "intro": "Myrcia pyramidata, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. Myrcia pyramidata thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal forests and sandy soils. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it a popular plant in horticulture and traditional medicine."
