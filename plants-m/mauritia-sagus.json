    "intro": "Mauritia sagus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce salt absorption. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Mauritia sagus plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and bird species."
