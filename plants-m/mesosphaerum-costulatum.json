    "intro": "Mesosphaerum costulatum, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and alternate, simple leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions. Mesosphaerum costulatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
