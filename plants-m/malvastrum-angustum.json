    "intro": "Malvastrum angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its showy flowers, which range from pink to lavender, bloom in summer and are borne on long, slender pedicels. Malvastrum angustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
