    "intro": "Mammillaria meyranii, commonly known as the Mezcala hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with white to pale green stems covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
