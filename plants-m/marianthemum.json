    "intro": "Marianthemum, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist environments across Europe and Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often emerging through snow-covered ground. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize wet areas effectively. Marianthemum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
