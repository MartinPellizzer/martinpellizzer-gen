    "intro": "Melicope adscendens, commonly known as the climbing melicope, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly rough texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
