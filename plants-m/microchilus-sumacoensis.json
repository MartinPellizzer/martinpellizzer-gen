    "intro": "Microchilus sumacoensis, commonly known as the Sumaco mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and maples, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
