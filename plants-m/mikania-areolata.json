It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of raised, warty tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
