    "intro": "Myrianthus gracilis, commonly known as the slender flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Myrianthus gracilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
