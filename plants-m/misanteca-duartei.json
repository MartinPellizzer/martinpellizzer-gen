    "intro": "Misanteca duartei, commonly known as the Duarte's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Cecropia*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time, making it an important ecological factor in tropical forests."
