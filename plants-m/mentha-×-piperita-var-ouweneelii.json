    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 piperita var. ouweneelii, commonly known as Ouweneel's peppermint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its aromatic, slightly serrated leaves and strong menthol scent. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its foliage is often used in herbal teas and aromatherapy due to its high menthol content. This variety is valued for its hardiness and distinct flavor profile compared to other peppermint cultivars."
