It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Microstylis biaurita is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its environment, making it a common species in its native range."
