    "intro": "Mimosa macroloba, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and savannas. Due to its sensitivity and unique morphology, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
