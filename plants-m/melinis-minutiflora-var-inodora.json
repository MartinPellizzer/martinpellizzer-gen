    "intro": "Melinis minutiflora var. inodora, commonly known as Texas grass or sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale in color, lacking the strong scent of its close relatives. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, contributing to its ecological importance in native plant communities."
