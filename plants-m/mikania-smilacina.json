    "intro": "Mikania smilacina, commonly known as goatweed, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves that are opposite or alternate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Mikania smilacina is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in open woodlands."
