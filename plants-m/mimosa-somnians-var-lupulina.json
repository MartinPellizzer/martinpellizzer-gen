    "intro": "Mimosa somnians var. lupulina, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for moist, shady garden environments. Due to its unique appearance and sensitivity to touch, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic and educational appeal."
