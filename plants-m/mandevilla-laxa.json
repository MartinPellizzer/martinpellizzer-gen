    "intro": "Mandevilla laxa, commonly known as the trailing mandevilla, is a vigorous, flowering vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are dark green and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil. Mandevilla laxa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cascade from containers or trellises."
