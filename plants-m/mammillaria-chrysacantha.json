    "intro": "Mammillaria chrysacantha, commonly known as the golden mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and densely covered with white to yellowish tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. It is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
