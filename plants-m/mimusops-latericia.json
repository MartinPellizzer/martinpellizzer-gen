It features a straight trunk with smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree has opposite, simple, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, often fragrant and attracting pollinators. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds."
