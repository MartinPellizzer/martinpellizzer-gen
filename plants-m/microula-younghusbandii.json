    "intro": "Microula younghusbandii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
