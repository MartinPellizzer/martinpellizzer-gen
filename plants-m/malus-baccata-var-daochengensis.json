    "intro": "Malus baccata var. daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng hawthorn, is a rare and endemic species native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and dense clusters of white flowers in spring. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold climates and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
