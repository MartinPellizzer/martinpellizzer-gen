    "intro": "Mitostigma parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered mitostigma, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems as a source of nectar for pollinators. The species is also of interest to botanists due to its potential medicinal properties and genetic diversity."
