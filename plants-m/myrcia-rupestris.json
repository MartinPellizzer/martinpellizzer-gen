    "intro": "Myrcia rupestris, commonly known as the rock myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. Myrcia rupestris is often found growing on rocky slopes and in humid forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
