    "intro": "Microlepia medogensis, commonly known as the Medog shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in high-altitude, rocky habitats with cool and moist conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
