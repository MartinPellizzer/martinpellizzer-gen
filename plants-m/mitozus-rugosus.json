    "intro": "Mitozus rugosus, commonly known as the rough moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and rugged, textured leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on specialized stalks and release spores for dispersal. Mitozus rugosus plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
