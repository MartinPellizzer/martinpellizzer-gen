    "intro": "Muhlenbergia setiglumis, commonly known as the silver feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and delicate, feathery seed heads that give it a soft, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its growth habit is clump-forming, and it produces light blue to silver flowers in late summer. Muhlenbergia setiglumis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
