    "intro": "Maianthemum amoenum, commonly known as the white false shamrock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a dense rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a loose cluster at the base of the leaves. It thrives in shady, moist woodland habitats and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
