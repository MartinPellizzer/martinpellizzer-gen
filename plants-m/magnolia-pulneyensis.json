    "intro": "Magnolia pulneyensis, commonly known as the Pulney magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white and pink. The plant has large, broad leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It grows as a deciduous tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
