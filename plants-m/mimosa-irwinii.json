    "intro": "Mimosa irwinii, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. Mimosa irwinii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
