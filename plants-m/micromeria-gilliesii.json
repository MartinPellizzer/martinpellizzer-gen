    "intro": "Micromeria gilliesii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Micromeria gilliesii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
