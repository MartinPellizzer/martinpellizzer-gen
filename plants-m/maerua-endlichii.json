    "intro": "Maerua endlichii, commonly known as the desert thorn or African thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Maerua endlichii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
