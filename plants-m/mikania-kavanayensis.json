    "intro": "Mikania kavanayensis, commonly known as the Kavanay's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the morning. The plant is an annual herb with trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
