    "intro": "Macleania, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence their common name. Macleania species are predominantly epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. They are native to areas such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Due to their delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, many species of Macleania are rare and face threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
