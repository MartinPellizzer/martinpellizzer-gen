    "intro": "Minuartia tricostata, commonly known as the three-ribbed sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hair-like structures, and its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Minuartia tricostata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments."
