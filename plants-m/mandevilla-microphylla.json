    "intro": "Mandevilla microphylla, commonly known as the miniature mandevilla, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail. Mandevilla microphylla is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces."
