    "intro": "Mascarenhasia arborea, commonly known as the Mascarene tree, is a species native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, grey bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal and dry forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
