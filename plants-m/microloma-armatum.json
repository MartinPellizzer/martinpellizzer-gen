    "intro": "Microloma armatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockheath, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
