It has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
