    "intro": "Maba intricata, commonly known as the delicate lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that create a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette structure that helps retain moisture. Maba intricata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
