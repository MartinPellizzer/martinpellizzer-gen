    "intro": "Mammillaria polythele f. quadrispina, commonly known as the four-spined mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, with four prominent central spines and numerous radial ones. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its slow growth and compact size. Its unique spination and drought tolerance make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
