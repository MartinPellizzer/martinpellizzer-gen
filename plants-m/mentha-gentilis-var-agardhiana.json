It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has a strong mint scent and is used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
