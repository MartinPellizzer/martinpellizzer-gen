    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha subsp. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem with prominent, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are covered in small, raised bumps called areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
