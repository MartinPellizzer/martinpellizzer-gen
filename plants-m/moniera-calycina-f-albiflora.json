    "intro": "Moniera calycina f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered calycine, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
