It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from narrow and pointed to broad and rounded. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued in herbal medicine for its aromatic leaves and potential therapeutic properties."
