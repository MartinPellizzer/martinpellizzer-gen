    "intro": "Miconia xanthocoma, commonly known as the yellow miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are bright red berries that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
