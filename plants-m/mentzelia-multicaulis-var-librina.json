It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
