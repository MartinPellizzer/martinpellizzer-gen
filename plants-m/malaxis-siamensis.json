    "intro": "Malaxis siamensis, commonly known as the Siam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant grows as an epiphyte, typically on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and delicate, with a distinct three-lobed lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis siamensis is considered a conservation concern."
