    "intro": "Methysticodendron, commonly known as the Moonflower Vine, is a striking botanical specimen native to the dense, humid rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that open only under moonlight, giving it its common name. Its roots are known to secrete a sap that contains psychoactive compounds, making it both ecologically and culturally significant. Due to its unique properties, Methysticodendron is highly sought after by botanists and herbalists alike."
