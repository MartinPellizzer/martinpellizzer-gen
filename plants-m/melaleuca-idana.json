    "intro": "Melaleuca idana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. Melaleuca idana is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and drought conditions."
