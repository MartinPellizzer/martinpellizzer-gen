    "intro": "Micrelium tolak, commonly known as the Tolak mountain lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of white or pale pink petals that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that disperse its seeds via the wind. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Micrelium tolak is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
