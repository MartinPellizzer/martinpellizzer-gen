    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata var. corallipes, commonly known as the coral-stemmed cycad, is a unique variant of the cycad genus Macrozamia. It is characterized by its distinctive, coral-like red or pink stems that are covered in a thick, fibrous layer. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a striking appearance. It is native to specific regions of Australia, where it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected and requires careful cultivation."
