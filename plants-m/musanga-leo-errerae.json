    "intro": "Musanga leo-errerae, commonly known as the Malawi cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the forests of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. Musanga leo-errerae is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
