It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
