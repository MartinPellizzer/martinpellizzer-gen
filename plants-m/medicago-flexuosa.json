It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Medicago flexuosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
