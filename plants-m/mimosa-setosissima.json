    "intro": "Mimosa setosissima, commonly known as the stinging mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the release of chemicals from its sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its stems and leaves contain a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, giving it its common name. Mimosa setosissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
