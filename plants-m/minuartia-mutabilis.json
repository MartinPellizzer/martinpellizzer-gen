    "intro": "Minuartia mutabilis, commonly known as the variable rockcress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in alpine or coastal environments."
