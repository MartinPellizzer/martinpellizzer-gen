    "intro": "Maytenus ilicifolia, commonly known as the Mexican olive, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is drought-tolerant once established. Maytenus ilicifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade."
