    "intro": "Millettia claessensii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by long, bean-like pods containing flat, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardiness and valuable timber, it plays an important ecological and economic role in its native region."
