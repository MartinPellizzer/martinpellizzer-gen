It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a milky latex sap, which is toxic and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used as a vegetable in some African cuisines. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
