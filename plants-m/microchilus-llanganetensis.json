    "intro": "Microchilus llanganetensis, commonly known as the Llanganete fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Chile. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
