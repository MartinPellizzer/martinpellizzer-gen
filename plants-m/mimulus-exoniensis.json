    "intro": "Mimulus exoniensis, commonly known as the Exeter water primrose, is a rare aquatic plant native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Mimulus exoniensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
