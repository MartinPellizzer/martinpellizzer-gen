    "intro": "Myroxylon digynum, commonly known as the Brazil wood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its rich color and durability. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Its seeds are encased in pods and contain a hard, fibrous pulp. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
