    "intro": "Melampyrum vulgatum var. ovatum, commonly known as the common touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The species is characterized by its lack of true roots, relying instead on haustoria to absorb nutrients from host plants."
