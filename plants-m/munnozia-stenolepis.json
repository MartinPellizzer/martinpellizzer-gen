    "intro": "Munnozia stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved muhly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-gray coloration due to a waxy coating. Munnozia stenolepis is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
