    "intro": "Marsdenia volubilis, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Marsdenia volubilis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
