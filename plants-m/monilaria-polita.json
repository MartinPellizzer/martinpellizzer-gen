    "intro": "Monilaria polita, commonly known as the velvet tunicate, is a marine colonial organism that belongs to the phylum Phylum. It forms dense, gelatinous colonies that attach to surfaces such as rocks and ship hulls. The colony is composed of a shared mesohyl matrix with specialized cells called choanocytes that filter food from the water. Its body structure includes a central canal surrounded by a ring of cells, and it lacks a true digestive system. Monilaria polita plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for various marine organisms."
