It features short, cylindrical stems with a greenish-gray color and sparse, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and compact growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections."
