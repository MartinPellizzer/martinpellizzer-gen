    "intro": "Miconia conica, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia conica is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
