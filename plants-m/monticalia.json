    "intro": "Monticalia, commonly known as the \"mountain orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of South America. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers and are typically found in humid, shaded environments. Monticalia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. They have specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and color variations."
