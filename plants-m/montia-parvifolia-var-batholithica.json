    "intro": "Montia parvifolia var. batholithica, commonly known as the batholith mountain enchanter, is a variant of the narrowleaf montia native to the western United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are pale pink to white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. This variant is notable for its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
