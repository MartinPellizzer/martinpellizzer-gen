    "intro": "Matricaria fuscata, commonly known as the dark yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, gray-green leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies, though it is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relative, chamomile. Matricaria fuscata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for gardens and wildflower meadows."
