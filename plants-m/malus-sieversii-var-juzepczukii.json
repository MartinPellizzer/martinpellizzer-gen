    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. juzepczukii, commonly known as the Juzepczukii apple, is a rare variant of the wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits with a high acidity level, which are typically used for making jams and preserves. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense foliage and produces flowers in the spring. It is closely related to the domesticated apple and is considered an important genetic resource for apple breeding programs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is also of interest for conservation efforts."
