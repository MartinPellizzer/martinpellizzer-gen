It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers and narrow, hairy leaves adapted to cold climates. This plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, where it withstands harsh weather conditions. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The alpine forget-me-not is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
