    "intro": "Microchilus alajuelae, commonly known as the Costa Rican orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the moist air and decomposing leaf litter, making it a typical epiphytic species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Microchilus alajuelae is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
