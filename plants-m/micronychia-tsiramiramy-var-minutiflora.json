    "intro": "Micronychia tsiramiramy var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered starling plant, is a rare and delicate flowering species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in a fine, silky pubescence. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
