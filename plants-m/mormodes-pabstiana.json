    "intro": "Mormodes pabstiana, commonly known as the Pabst's orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a compact rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
