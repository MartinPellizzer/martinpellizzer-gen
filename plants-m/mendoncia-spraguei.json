    "intro": "Mendoncia spraguei, commonly known as the Sprague's mendoncia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
