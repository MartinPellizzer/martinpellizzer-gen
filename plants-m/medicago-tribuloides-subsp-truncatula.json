    "intro": "Medicago tribuloides subsp. truncatula, commonly known as the narrowleaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is used as forage for livestock. The seeds are small and contain high levels of protein, making them valuable in certain agricultural contexts."
