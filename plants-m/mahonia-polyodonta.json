    "intro": "Mahonia polyodonta, commonly known as the many-fruited mahonia, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with holly-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its architectural form and seasonal interest."
