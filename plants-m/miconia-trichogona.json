    "intro": "Miconia trichogona, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by dark purple, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin, while its stems are often covered in a waxy coating. Miconia trichogona is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common invasive species in some regions."
