It is native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay, and thrives in dry, temperate climates. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are soft and feathery, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
