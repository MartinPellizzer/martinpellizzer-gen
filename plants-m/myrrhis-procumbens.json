    "intro": "Myrrhis procumbens, commonly known as creeping myrrh, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Alphitoniaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Myrrhis procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
