    "intro": "Macaranga seta-felis, commonly known as the hairy leaf ghost tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is often found in secondary forests and along forest edges."
