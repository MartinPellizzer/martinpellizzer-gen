    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in other wetland habitats. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly toothed or frayed margin. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
