    "intro": "Macrosamanea discolor var. discolor, commonly known as the discolor macrocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often displaying a pale green or blue-gray coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by spiny, red fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water due to its succulent nature. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
