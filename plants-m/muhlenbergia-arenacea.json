    "intro": "Muhlenbergia arenacea, commonly known as sand muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
