    "intro": "Magnolia heliophila, commonly known as the sun magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are composed of nine to 15 petals and are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Magnolia heliophila prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
