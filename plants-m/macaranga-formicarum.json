    "intro": "Macaranga formicarum, commonly known as the antplant, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter in specialized structures called domatia. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it a common pioneer species. The plant also plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting diverse insect and bird life."
