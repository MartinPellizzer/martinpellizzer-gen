    "intro": "Microchlaena cuspidata, commonly known as the narrowleaf microchlaena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Microchlaena cuspidata is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in regions with well-drained soils."
