    "intro": "Macrothelypteris torresiana var. calvata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The varietal name 'calvata' refers to the reduced or absent hairs on the fronds compared to the typical variety."
