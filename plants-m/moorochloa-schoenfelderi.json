    "intro": "Moorochloa schoenfelderi, commonly known as the slender moorgrass, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows in coastal and inland regions, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
