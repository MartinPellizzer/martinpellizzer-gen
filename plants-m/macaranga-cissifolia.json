It is characterized by its alternate, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Macaranga cissifolia is also known for its rapid growth rate and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
