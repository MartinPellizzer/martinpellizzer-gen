    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. cordifolia, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The leaves are broadly ovate to cordate in shape, with a serrated margin and a strong, aromatic scent. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in whorls along the stems during the summer months. This variety is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its menthol content and refreshing aroma."
