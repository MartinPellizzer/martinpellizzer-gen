It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Minquartia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its unique appearance and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
