It produces large, showy flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, with a distinctive hooded shape. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems, which help in identifying it in the field. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod and can be used in traditional medicine. Mucuna rhynchosioides is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
