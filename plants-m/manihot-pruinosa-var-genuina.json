    "intro": "Manihot pruinosa var. genuina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or wild cassava, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has a fibrous root system. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its leaves are edible but can cause skin irritation due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals."
