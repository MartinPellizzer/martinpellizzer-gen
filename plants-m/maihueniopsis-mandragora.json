    "intro": "Maihueniopsis mandragora, commonly known as the Andean mandrake, is a rare and endangered plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species."
