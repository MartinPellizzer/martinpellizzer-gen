    "intro": "Manilkara jaimiqui, commonly known as the Jaimiqui or Jaimiqui sapodilla, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces a fruit with a thick, sweet pulp that is often used in traditional foods. Its latex, which is milky and viscous, has been historically used for various purposes, including as a natural rubber substitute. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is often found in moist, lowland forests."
