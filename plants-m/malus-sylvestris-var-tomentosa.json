    "intro": "Malus sylvestris var. tomentosa, commonly known as the downy apple, is a variant of the domesticated apple species. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is native to Central Asia and is often found in forested areas. It produces small, edible fruits that are typically less palatable than those of the cultivated apple. The plant is valued for its ornamental features and has been used in horticultural breeding programs."
