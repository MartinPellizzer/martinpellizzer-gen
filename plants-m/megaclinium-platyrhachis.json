    "intro": "Megaclinium platyrhachis, commonly known as the broad-ridge grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, broad leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
