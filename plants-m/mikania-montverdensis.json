It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
