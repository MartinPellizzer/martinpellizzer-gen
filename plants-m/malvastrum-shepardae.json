    "intro": "Malvastrum shepardae, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep root systems and minimal water requirements."
