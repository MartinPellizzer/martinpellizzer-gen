    "intro": "Mazus pulchellus, commonly known as the pretty mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Mazus pulchellus is also noted for its ability to spread easily through stolons, forming dense ground cover."
