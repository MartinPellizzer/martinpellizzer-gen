    "intro": "Melaleuca fimbriata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, papery bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery or greyish underside. Melaleuca fimbriata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
