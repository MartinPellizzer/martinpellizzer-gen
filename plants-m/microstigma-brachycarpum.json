    "intro": "Microstigma brachycarpum, commonly known as the small-stigma short-carpel plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many legumes. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
