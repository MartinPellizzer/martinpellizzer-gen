    "intro": "Malvaviscus arboreus subsp. penduliflorus, commonly known as the hanging-flower mallow, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central column. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release hairy seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
