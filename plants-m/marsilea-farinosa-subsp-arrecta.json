    "intro": "Marsilea farinosa subsp. arrecta, commonly known as the curly water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a four-leaf clover-like pattern. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, flour-like coating, which gives it its scientific name. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
