    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf touch-me-not, is a variant of the common touch-me-not, characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical form. It is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, open habitats like meadows and woodlands, often in areas with partial shade. The broad foliage and distinct floral structure make it a distinctive botanical feature in its native range."
