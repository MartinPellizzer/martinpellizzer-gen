    "intro": "Maughania rollae, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate orchid-like flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
