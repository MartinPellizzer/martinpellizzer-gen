    "intro": "Metastelma pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's metastelma, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
