    "intro": "Mentha pulegium var. villosa, commonly known as hairy pennyroyal, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils with strong menthol-like properties, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
