    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia paucifolia, commonly known as silver mohair, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features soft, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muehlenbeckia paucifolia is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental foliage and ease of maintenance."
