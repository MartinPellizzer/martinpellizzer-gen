    "intro": "Martinezia ulei, commonly known as the Mexican silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in the spring, are clustered in terminal inflorescences and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Martinezia ulei is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
