    "intro": "Memecylon corticosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved memecylon, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, sometimes pubescent texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
