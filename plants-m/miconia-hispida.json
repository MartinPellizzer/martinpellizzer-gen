    "intro": "Miconia hispida, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Miconia hispida is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. It is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain regions."
