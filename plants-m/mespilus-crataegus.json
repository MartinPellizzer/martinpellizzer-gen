    "intro": "Mespilus crataegus, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries known as haws, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Mespilus crataegus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
