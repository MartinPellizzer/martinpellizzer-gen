    "intro": "Monorchis, commonly known as the single-ovary orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique floral structure, featuring a single ovary and a specialized lip that aids in pollination. Monorchis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing as epiphytes on trees or rocks. Their leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in their natural habitats. The flowers are often brightly colored, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators."
