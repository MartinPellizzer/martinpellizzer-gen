    "intro": "Manihot discolor, commonly known as the spotted bittercup, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a yellowish-green color and red veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is generally toxic due to the presence of latex. The species is also cultivated for its ornamental value in some regions."
