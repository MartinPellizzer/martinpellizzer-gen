    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha f. petermannii, commonly known as the Petermann's blackthorn, is a rare botanical variant of the blackthorn species. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
