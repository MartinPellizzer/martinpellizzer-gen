    "intro": "Mimosa ramentacea, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Mimosa ramentacea is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
