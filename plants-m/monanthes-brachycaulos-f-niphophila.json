    "intro": "Monanthes brachycaulos f. niphophila, commonly known as the snow-tipped bellflower, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and frost-resistant adaptations. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often covered in a fine, powdery coating to reduce water loss. The plant's leaves are short and fleshy, designed to store moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
