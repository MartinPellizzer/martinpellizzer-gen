    "intro": "Miconia valenzuelana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by distinctive, velvety, red or purple fruits. Miconia valenzuelana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
