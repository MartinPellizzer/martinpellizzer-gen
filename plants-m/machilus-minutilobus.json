    "intro": "Machilus minutilobus, commonly known as the small-lobed machilus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to China, particularly found in the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, dark-colored berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Machilus minutilobus is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
