    "intro": "Mikania hoffmanniana, commonly known as Hoffmann's morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
