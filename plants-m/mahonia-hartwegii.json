    "intro": "Mahonia hartwegii, commonly known as the Texas Mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features compound leaves with spiny tips and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces black, egg-shaped berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage and long blooming period."
