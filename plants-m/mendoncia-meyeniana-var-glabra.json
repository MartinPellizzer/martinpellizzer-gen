    "intro": "Mendoncia meyeniana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth mendoncia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
