It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Moulinsia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
