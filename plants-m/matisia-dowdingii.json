It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at high elevations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
