    "intro": "Mespilus uniflora subvar. florida, commonly known as the Florida white mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during early spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small, green berries. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ornamental use in gardens and as a wildlife habitat. The species is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
