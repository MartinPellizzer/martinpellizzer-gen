    "intro": "Maharanga waltonii, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The tree has a spreading canopy with pinnate leaves that turn red in the autumn. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental planting. The bark is smooth and light grey, often peeling in thin layers as the tree matures."
