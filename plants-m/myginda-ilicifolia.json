    "intro": "Myginda ilicifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf myginda, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical or ovate in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. Myginda ilicifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
