    "intro": "Maxillariella stictantha, commonly known as the Stictantha orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a miniature orchid with compact, hairy pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a yellowish lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a potted plant."
