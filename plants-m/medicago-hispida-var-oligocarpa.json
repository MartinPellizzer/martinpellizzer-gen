    "intro": "Medicago hispida var. oligocarpa, commonly known as prickly medic, is a perennial forage legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, spiny pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness and nutritional value. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
