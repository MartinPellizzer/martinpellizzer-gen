    "intro": "Mimosa diversifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens in warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
