It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
