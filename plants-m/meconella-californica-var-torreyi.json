    "intro": "Meconella californica var. torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey's meconella, is a flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, oval fruits known as schizocarps, which release tiny seeds when mature. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its adaptation to the Mediterranean climate of California."
