It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it its common name. The plant features prominent areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in early summer. Mammillaria cirrhifera is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
