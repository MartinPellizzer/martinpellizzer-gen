    "intro": "Melicope paniculata, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Cook Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a keystone species in its native ecosystems and its historical use in traditional medicine and fragrance."
