    "intro": "Melocactus bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia melon cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces a single, spiny areole with a single, elongated, white or yellowish spination. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areole in late spring or early summer. Melocactus bahiensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stem and featuring a dense covering of spines for protection."
