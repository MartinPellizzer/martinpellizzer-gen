    "intro": "Mimosa honesta, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open woodland or disturbed soils. Its rapid leaf movement has made it a subject of scientific study, particularly in the field of plant physiology."
