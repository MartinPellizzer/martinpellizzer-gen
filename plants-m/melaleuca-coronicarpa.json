    "intro": "Melaleuca coronicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically followed by distinctive, urn-shaped seed capsules. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
