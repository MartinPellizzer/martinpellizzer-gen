It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its bluish-green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in succulent gardens."
