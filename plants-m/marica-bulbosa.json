    "intro": "Marica bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous marica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
