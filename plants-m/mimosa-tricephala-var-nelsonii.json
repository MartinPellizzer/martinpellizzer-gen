    "intro": "Mimosa tricephala var. nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are slender and often trailing, making it suitable for hanging baskets or containers. The species is valued in horticulture for its rapid growth and unique, responsive foliage."
