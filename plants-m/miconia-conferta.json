    "intro": "Miconia conferta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing numerous small seeds. Miconia conferta is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
