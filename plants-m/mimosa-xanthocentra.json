    "intro": "Mimosa xanthocentra, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn a striking yellow color in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is also used in soil restoration projects."
