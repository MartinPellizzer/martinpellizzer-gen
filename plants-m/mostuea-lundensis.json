    "intro": "Mostuea lundensis, commonly known as the Lund's marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, with a distinct three-lobed lip. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
