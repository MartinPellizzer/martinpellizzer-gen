    "intro": "Mandarus pes-caprae, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in sandy, saline environments and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate salt spray and wind."
