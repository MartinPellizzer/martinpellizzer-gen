    "intro": "Milium poiforme, commonly known as the clustered millet, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Milium poiforme is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
