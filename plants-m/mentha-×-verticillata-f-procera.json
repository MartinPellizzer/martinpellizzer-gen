    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. procera, commonly known as the giant marsh mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to wetland areas in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, riverbanks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it useful in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
