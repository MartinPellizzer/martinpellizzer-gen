    "intro": "Miconia evanescens, commonly known as the ghost miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
