    "intro": "Myrcia eriocephala, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Myrcia eriocephala has been introduced to other regions, where it can become an invasive species due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
