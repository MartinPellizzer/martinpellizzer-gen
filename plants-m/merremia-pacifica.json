    "intro": "Merremia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a vigorous climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and showy flowers make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
