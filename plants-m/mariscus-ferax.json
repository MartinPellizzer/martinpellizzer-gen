    "intro": "Mariscus ferax, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, bract-like leaves. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along rocky shores and dunes. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, aiding survival in arid environments. Mariscus ferax is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with saline conditions."
