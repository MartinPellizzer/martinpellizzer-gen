    "intro": "Meconopsis napaulensis f. fuscopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-pink Himalayan poppy, is a striking perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Nepal and northern India. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep purple to pale pink, often with a contrasting central blotch. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are hairy and adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a symbol of the Himalayan flora."
