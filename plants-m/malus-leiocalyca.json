    "intro": "Malus leiocalyca, commonly known as the smooth-leaved apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, round fruits similar to apples. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects. The plant is also noted for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
