    "intro": "Muscari, commonly known as grape hyacinth, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. These plants are characterized by their dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that resemble tiny grapes, hence their common name. Muscari species are native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, and they thrive in well-drained soil and full sun. They are often used in gardens for their early spring blooms and their ability to naturalize over time. The bulbs of muscari are toxic if ingested, so caution is advised when handling them."
