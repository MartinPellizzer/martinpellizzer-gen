    "intro": "Mimosa camporum, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic plant, is a herbaceous species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Mimosa camporum is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
