    "intro": "Mariscus goniobolbus, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, ribbed stems that are often branched and covered with a waxy coating. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive blue-green color due to the presence of a thick cuticle. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bead-like, greenish capsules containing the seeds. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
