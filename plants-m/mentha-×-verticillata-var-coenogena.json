    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. coenogena, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are covered in fine, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple to blue in color, arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. This variety is notable for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of essential oils."
