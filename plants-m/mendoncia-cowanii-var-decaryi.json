    "intro": "Mendoncia cowanii var. decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's mendoncia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
