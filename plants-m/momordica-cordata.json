    "intro": "Momordica cordata, commonly known as the spurred cucumber, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive spurred tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red, spiky fruits. Its fruit is edible when ripe, though it has a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
