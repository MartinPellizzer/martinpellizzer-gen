It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Meum diffusum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
