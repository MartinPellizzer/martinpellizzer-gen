    "intro": "Myrcia marianae, commonly known as the Brazilian myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and glossy, and its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Myrcia marianae produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable plant in its native habitat."
