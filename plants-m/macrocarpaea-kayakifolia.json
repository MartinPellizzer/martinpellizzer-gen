    "intro": "Macrocarpaea kayakifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical rainforests, thriving in the humid climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
