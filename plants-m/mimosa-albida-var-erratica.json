It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
