    "intro": "Manettia teresitae, commonly known as the white-flowered manettia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth, glossy surface. Manettia teresitae is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
