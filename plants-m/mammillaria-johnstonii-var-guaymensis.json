    "intro": "Mammillaria johnstonii var. guaymensis, commonly known as the Guaymes Needle cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with numerous white to pale green spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
