    "intro": "Medica coronata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in landscaping and restoration projects. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and it is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
