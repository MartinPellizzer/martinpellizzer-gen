    "intro": "[WRONG START] McNeillia saxifraga, commonly known as the saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. McNeillia saxifraga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
