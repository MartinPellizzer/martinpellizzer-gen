It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
