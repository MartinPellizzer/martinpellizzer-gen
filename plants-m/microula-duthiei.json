    "intro": "Microula duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's microula, is a flowering plant species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a shallow root system and thick leaves that help conserve water. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically short-lived. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microula duthiei is considered a rare and poorly understood species."
