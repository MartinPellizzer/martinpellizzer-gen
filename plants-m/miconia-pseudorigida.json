    "intro": "Miconia pseudorigida, commonly known as the Brazilian star-apple tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits. Miconia pseudorigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit, which has a sweet, tropical flavor. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
