    "intro": "Microlespedeza stipulacea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sesban, is a small perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, stipulate leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments. Microlespedeza stipulacea is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
