It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems and leaves. It produces vibrant pink or purple flowers that bloom in response to sunlight, often during the cooler months. Mesembryanthemum commutatum is also known for its ability to form dense mats, making it a popular ornamental plant in dry gardens."
