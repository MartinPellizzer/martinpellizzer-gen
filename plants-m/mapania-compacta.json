    "intro": "Mapania compacta, commonly known as the compact mallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and for its ecological benefits to pollinators."
