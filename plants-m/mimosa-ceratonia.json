    "intro": "Mimosa ceratonia, commonly known as the Jerusalem cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, cherry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
