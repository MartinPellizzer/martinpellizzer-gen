    "intro": "Microcharis ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral morning glory, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its ephemeral nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking seasonal color and biodiversity."
