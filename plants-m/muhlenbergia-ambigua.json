    "intro": "Muhlenbergia ambigua, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, pale green to brown seed heads during the late summer and fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia ambigua is often used in native plant gardens for its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
