    "intro": "Michelia mollis, commonly known as the fragrant michelia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and its showy, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, reddish-brown fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant fragrance and graceful appearance."
