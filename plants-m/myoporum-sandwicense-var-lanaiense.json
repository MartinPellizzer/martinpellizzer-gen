It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
