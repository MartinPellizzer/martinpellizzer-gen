    "intro": "Microula trichocarpa var. lasiantha, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access moisture from deep underground. The species is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
