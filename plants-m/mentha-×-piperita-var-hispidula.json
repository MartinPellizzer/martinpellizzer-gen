    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 piperita var. hispidula, commonly known as hedge mint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and strong aromatic fragrance. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its use in herbal teas and traditional medicine due to its high menthol content."
