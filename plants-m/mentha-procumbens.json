    "intro": "Mentha procumbens, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with thin, rhizomatous stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and have a strong, refreshing mint aroma. Creeping mint is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to its aromatic properties."
