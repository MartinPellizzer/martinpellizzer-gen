    "intro": "Mirabilis decumbens, commonly known as the creeping four o'clock, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, four-petaled flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at night. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides."
