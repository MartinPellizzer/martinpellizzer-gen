    "intro": "Miconia ciliata var. attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are edible but have a strong, unpleasant taste. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
