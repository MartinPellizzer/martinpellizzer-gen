    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum geniculiflorum, commonly known as the zigzag iceplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that form a low-growing, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
