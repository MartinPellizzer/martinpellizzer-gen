    "intro": "Macrorhynchus californicus, commonly known as the California giant ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is an annual herb that can grow up to 6 feet tall, with a robust stem that is often branched. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, green fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions."
