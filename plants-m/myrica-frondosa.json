    "intro": "Myrica frondosa, commonly known as the frondous wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica frondosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
