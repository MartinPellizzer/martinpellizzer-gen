    "intro": "Microphyton, commonly known as the smallest known free-living green alga, is a unicellular organism belonging to the Chlorophyta phylum. It measures only a few micrometers in length and lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Microphyton thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in nutrient-rich soils and on moist surfaces. Its simple structure allows it to perform photosynthesis efficiently under low light conditions. This plant plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for microorganisms."
