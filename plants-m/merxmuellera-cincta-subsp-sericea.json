It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant has a dense, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, giving it a silky appearance. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Eucalyptus* and *Myrtus*. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often clustered, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds."
