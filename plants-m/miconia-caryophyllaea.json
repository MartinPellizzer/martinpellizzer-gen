    "intro": "Miconia caryophyllaea, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often surrounded by bright red bracts, making it visually striking. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist lowland forests. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
