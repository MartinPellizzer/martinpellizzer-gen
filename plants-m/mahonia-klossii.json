    "intro": "Mahonia klossii, commonly known as Kloss's mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Mahonia klossii thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and seasonal blooms."
