    "intro": "Melanophylla modestei, commonly known as the modest moonflower, is a striking member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the arid regions of Central America, where it thrives in sandy soils and warm climates. The plant is notable for its large, pale lavender flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a velvety texture that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique nighttime blooming habit."
