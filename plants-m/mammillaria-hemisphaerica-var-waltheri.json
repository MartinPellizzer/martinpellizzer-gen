    "intro": "Mammillaria hemisphaerica var. waltheri, commonly known as the Walther's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. It originates from the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features a short, thick stem with areoles that produce both radial and central spines. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late spring. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is relatively easy to care for in a desert garden or indoor setting."
