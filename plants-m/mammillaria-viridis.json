    "intro": "Mammillaria viridis, commonly known as the green mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, globular shape and dense covering of white to yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Mammillaria viridis is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
