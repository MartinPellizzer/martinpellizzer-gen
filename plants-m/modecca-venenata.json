    "intro": "Modecca venenata, commonly known as the toxic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of southern Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the green calyx. The plant has a fibrous root system and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. However, it is highly toxic, containing compounds that can cause severe gastrointestinal distress if ingested."
