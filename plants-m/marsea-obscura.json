    "intro": "Marsea obscura, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and elusive fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that appear almost translucent, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of trees. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are small and inconspicuous, typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Marsea obscura is considered a species of conservation concern."
