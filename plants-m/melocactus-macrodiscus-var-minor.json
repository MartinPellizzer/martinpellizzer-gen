    "intro": "Melocactus macrodiscus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser giant melon cactus, is a compact, columnar cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It features a short, thick stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and a dense covering of white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, melon-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
