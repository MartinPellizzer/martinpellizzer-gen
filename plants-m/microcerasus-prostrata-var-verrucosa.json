    "intro": "Microcerasus prostrata var. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, showing tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
