    "intro": "Marsilea europaea, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble clover, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of buoyant, seed-bearing fruits. Marsilea europaea is often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
