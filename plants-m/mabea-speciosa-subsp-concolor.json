    "intro": "Mabea speciosa subsp. concolor, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
