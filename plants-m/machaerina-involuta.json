    "intro": "Machaerina involuta, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a unique spiral arrangement of its fronds, which gives it a striking, otherworldly appearance. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's growth in moist, shaded environments. Machaerina involuta is native to New Zealand and plays an important ecological role in its natural habitat."
