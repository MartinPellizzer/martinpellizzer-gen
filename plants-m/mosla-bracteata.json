    "intro": "Mosla bracteata, commonly known as Chinese burnet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with small, rounded leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are typically surrounded by bracts, which are modified leaves that give the plant its common name. Mosla bracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
