It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while photosynthesis occurs through its own leaves. It is often found in forested areas, particularly in India and Southeast Asia. Its ornamental value and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
