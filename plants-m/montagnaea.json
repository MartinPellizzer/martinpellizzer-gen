It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that often bloom in spring. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Montagnaea species are known for their ability to thrive in cool, humid climates. Their unique morphology and ecological niche make them an important part of their native ecosystems."
