    "intro": "Minuartia corymbulosa, commonly known as the clustered rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Minuartia corymbulosa is often found in open, sunny habitats and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
