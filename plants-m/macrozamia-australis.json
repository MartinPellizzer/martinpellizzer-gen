    "intro": "Macrozamia australis, commonly known as the southern cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, rugged trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
