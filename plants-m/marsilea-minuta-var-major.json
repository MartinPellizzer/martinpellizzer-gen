    "intro": "Marsilea minuta var. major, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern characterized by its intricate, clover-like leaves that float on the water surface. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant's leaves are divided into four to eight small, oval-shaped lobes, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into dark, bladder-like fruits containing minute seeds. This species is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
