    "intro": "Manihot sinuata var. genuina, commonly known as the pink arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically pink to red in color, which help it stand out in water environments. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in marshes and ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is popular in aquatic gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
