    "intro": "Marginaria verrucosa, commonly known as the rough margined orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy, rough texture along the margins. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a spike, with a distinct three-lobed lip. Marginaria verrucosa is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
