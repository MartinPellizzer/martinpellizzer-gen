    "intro": "Moquinia argyrea, commonly known as silverleaf moquinhia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often found in swampy environments. Moquinia argyrea plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
