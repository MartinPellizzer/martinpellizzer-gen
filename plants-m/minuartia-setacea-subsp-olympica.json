    "intro": "Minuartia setacea subsp. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
