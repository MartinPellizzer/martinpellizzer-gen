    "intro": "Macrostylis wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects."
