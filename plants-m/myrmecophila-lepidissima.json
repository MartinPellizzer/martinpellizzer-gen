It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Myrmecophila lepidissima is often found in association with ant colonies, which may play a role in its ecological interactions."
