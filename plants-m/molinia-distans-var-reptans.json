    "intro": "Molinia distans var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wet and acidic habitats in northern Europe. It forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that often lie close to the ground, giving it a carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and colonize open, moist areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing peat soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
