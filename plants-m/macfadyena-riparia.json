    "intro": "Macfadyena riparia, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking clusters of white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Macfadyena riparia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
