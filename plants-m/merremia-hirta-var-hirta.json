    "intro": "Merremia hirta var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is typically twining and can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing supports or other vegetation. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, hence its common name. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
