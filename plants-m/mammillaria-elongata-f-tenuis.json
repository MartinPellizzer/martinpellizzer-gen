    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata f. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems with narrow, rib-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its delicate structure, it is often cultivated as a prized ornamental plant in cactus collections."
