    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys var. hypophegea, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Its structure consists of a single stem with a cluster of leaves at the base and a terminal inflorescence. Due to its pale coloration and ghostly appearance, it is often referred to as a \"ghost plant.\""
