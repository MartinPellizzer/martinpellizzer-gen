    "intro": "Massowia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their striking yellow or orange bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in summer. Massowia species typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with small, often hairy leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral display."
