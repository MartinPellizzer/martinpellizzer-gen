    "intro": "Maianthemum cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf false shamrock, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to eastern North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
