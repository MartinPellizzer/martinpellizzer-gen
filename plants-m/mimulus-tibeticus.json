    "intro": "Mimulus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which resemble the shape of a monkey's face, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Mimulus tibeticus plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
