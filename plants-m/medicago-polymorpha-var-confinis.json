    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. confinis, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, hairy stems and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its extensive root system. Medicago polymorpha var. confinis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
