    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 gillotii, commonly known as giant mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha hangelii and Mentha \u00d7 piperita. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a strong menthol scent. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, typically in late summer. Mentha \u00d7 gillotii is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal purposes."
