    "intro": "Mimosa glaucescens var. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, fuzzy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are borne on slender peduncles. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. The leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
