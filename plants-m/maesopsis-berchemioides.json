    "intro": "Maesopsis berchemioides, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, simple leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
