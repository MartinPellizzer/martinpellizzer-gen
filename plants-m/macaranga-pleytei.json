    "intro": "Macaranga pleytei, commonly known as the white-veined macaranga, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in lowland rainforests. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The species is also noted for its rapid growth rate and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
