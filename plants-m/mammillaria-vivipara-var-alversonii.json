    "intro": "Mammillaria vivipara var. alversonii, commonly known as the Alverson's nipple cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines and small, rounded areoles that produce short, pale bristles. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 inches and has a distinctive appearance with its clustered, nipple-like tubercles. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in arid gardens."
