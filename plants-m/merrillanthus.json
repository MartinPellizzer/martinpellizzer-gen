    "intro": "Merrillanthus, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance. The plant has no known leaves or stems, with its entire structure consisting of a single, translucent, waxy flower that appears to float in the air. Merrillanthus is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered critically endangered due to habitat loss and climate change. Its unique biology and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike."
