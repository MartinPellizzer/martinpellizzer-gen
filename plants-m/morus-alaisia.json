    "intro": "Morus alaisia, commonly known as the Alaisia mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The tree produces edible berries that are typically consumed when ripe, though they are less commonly cultivated than other mulberry species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. The wood of Morus alaisia is valued for its strength and is used in traditional craftsmanship."
