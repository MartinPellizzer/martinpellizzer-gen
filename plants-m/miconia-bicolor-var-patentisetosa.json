    "intro": "Miconia bicolor var. patentisetosa, commonly known as the showy miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropics. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and showy fruit. However, it can be invasive in some regions and is sometimes considered a weed."
