It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with five petals, and bloom during the wet season. Microsemma setosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
