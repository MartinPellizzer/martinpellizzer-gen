    "intro": "Milium inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous millet, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Due to its subtle appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
