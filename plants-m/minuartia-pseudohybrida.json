    "intro": "Minuartia pseudohybrida, commonly known as the hybrid sand-flower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Minuartia pseudohybrida is a perennial species that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
