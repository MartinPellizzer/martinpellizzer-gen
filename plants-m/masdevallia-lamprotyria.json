    "intro": "Masdevallia lamprotyria, commonly known as the velvet lip orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and striking, pale pink to lavender flowers with a contrasting dark lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light intensity. Due to its specific requirements, it is a challenging species to cultivate outside its native range."
