    "intro": "Marsilea strigosa, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are often used as a decorative element in ponds and water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, floating spores that are released into the water, allowing for widespread dispersal. Marsilea strigosa is also notable for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation efforts."
