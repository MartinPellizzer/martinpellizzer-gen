It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover."
