    "intro": "Malleola sanguinicors, commonly known as the blood-veined malleola, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red veins that run through its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malleola sanguinicors is considered a vulnerable species."
