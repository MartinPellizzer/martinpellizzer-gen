    "intro": "Medicago diffusa, commonly known as the common goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Medicago diffusa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
