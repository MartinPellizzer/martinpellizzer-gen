    "intro": "Miconia trianae, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are highly ornamental. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and showy fruits. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
