    "intro": "Majidea multijuga, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, blue-gray leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
