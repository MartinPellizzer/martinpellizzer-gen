It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to arid and saline environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in the morning and close by midday. Mesembryanthemum spinescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
