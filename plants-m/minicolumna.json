    "intro": "Minicolumna, commonly known as the dwarf columnar cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that grow in a compact, column-like form. The plant typically has spiny or woolly areoles, which are specialized structures for producing spines, flowers, and branches. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Minicolumna is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient availability."
