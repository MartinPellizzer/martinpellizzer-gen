    "intro": "Melilotus brachylobus, commonly known as the short-lobed sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sweet, honey-like scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Melilotus brachylobus is also valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
