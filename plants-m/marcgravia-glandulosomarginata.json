    "intro": "Marcgravia glandulosomarginata, commonly known as the sticky-margin heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble hands, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bats. The leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into fleshy, red or orange berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a significant species in tropical ecosystems."
