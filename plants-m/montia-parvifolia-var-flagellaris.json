    "intro": "Montia parvifolia var. flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate filbert, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, spreading stems that often trail along the ground, and its small, lance-shaped leaves are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The flowers are tiny, white to pale pink, and arranged in clusters along the stem, typical of the Montiaceae family. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, whip-like appearance, which gives it its common name."
