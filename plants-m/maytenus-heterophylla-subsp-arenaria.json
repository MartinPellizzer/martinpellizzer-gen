    "intro": "Maytenus heterophylla subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the desert mayten, is a shrub native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its structure and physiology make it well-suited for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
