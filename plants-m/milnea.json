    "intro": "Milnea, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asclepiadaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but beneficial for monarch butterflies. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Milnea plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for various insects."
