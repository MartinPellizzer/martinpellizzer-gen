    "intro": "Mazus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, Mazus pumilio is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic value."
