    "intro": "Micromeria darwinii var. pallida, commonly known as the white-flowered micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The species is characterized by its small, pale flowers and succulent, hairy leaves adapted to withstand drought. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
