    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum tuberculosum, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its adaptations to arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. The leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
