    "intro": "Maerua arenicola, commonly known as the coastal maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray. Its resilience makes it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems."
