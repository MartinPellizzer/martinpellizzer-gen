    "intro": "Melaleuca valida, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, yellow, and brown beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or cream flowers that bloom in winter, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slight waxy coating. Melaleuca valida is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
