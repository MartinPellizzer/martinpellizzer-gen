    "intro": "Marcetia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in South America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a basal rosette of hairy, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow-green coloration and a spurred lip. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and swampy areas. Marcetia pubescens plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
