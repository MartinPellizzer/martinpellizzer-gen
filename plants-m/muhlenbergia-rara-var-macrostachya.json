    "intro": "Muhlenbergia rara var. macrostachya, commonly known as the silver hair muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-tomentose leaves and tall, slender flowering stalks that bear panicles of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or along stream banks. It is a clump-forming perennial that produces viable seeds, contributing to its natural distribution. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fine texture and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
