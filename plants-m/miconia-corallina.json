    "intro": "Miconia corallina, commonly known as the coral miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. It is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
