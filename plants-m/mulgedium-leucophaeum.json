    "intro": "Mulgedium leucophaeum, commonly known as the white-leaved mulgedium, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structure. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is native to specific regions in southern Europe. The plant features finely divided, white-veined leaves that give it a striking appearance, and its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Mulgedium leucophaeum is adapted to rocky and calcareous soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
