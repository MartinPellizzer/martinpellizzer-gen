The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to dry climates. Mesembryanthemum subalatum is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
