    "intro": "Morrisiella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive yellowish or greenish hue. Morrisiella species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetlands and disturbed soils. They play a role in both ecological systems and are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas."
