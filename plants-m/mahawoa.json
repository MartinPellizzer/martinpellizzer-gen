    "intro": "Mahawoa, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a member of the Asphodelaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and large, strap-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Mahawoa is widely used for its strong, fibrous leaves, which have been traditionally harvested for weaving and other crafts. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
