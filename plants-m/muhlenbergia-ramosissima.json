    "intro": "Muhlenbergia ramosissima, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and slender, arching stems that form dense clumps. The plant produces feathery plumes of pale green to white flowers in late summer, which are highly ornamental. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
