    "intro": "Myriocarpa paniculata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its fibrous roots allow it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Myriocarpa paniculata is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
