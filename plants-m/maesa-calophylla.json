    "intro": "Maesa calophylla, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is also considered an endangered species due to overharvesting. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
