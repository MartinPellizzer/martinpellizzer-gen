    "intro": "Macaranga gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant macaranga, is a large shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded forest environments. Its rapid growth rate and ability to form dense thickets make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
