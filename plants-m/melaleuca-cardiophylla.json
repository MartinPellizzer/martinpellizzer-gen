    "intro": "Melaleuca cardiophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Melaleuca cardiophylla produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in winter, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
