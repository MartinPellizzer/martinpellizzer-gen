    "intro": "Moenchia mantica, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Moenchia mantica is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
