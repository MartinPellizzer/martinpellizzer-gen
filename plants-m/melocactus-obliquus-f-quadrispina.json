    "intro": "Melocactus obliquus f. quadrispina, commonly known as the four-spined melocactus, is a unique variant of the melocactus genus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and the presence of four prominent spines, which distinguish it from other melocactus species. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which appear during the warmer months, are usually yellow or orange and are borne at the top of the stem. This cultivar is valued for its compact size and distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
