It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring, displaying shades of pink, red, and purple. The plant produces bulbils along its stems, which are small, vegetative propagules used for asexual reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
