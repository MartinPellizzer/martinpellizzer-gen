    "intro": "Mammillaria dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branching hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of northern Mexico. It is a low-growing cactus with a short, thick stem that branches into two main stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are short and often cover the entire body of the plant. Mammillaria dichotoma is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
