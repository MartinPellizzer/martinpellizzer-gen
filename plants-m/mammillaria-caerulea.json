It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and blue-gray spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique coloration and compact form, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
