It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that eventually develop into spiny, green fruits. The fruits are edible when ripe, with a sweet, creamy pulp and a single large seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food in tropical regions."
