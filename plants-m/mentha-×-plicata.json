It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves and flowers are used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their menthol-like scent and cooling properties.
