    "intro": "Miconia mornicola, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Its showy, pinkish-white flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the wet season. Miconia mornicola is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some areas."
