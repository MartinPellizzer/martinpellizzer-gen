    "intro": "Microchaeta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or purple in color. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like covering, which aids in wind dispersal. Microchaeta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in many regions."
