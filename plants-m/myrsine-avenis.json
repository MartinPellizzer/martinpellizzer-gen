It typically features dense, dark green leaves that are small and oval in shape, with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Myrsine avenis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover."
