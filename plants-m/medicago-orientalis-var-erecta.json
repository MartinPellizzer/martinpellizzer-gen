    "intro": "Medicago orientalis var. erecta, commonly known as the upright goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
