    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica var. humilis, commonly known as the lesser forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features delicate blue or violet flowers with a white center, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the common forget-me-not, with \"humilis\" indicating its shorter stature."
