    "intro": "Mentha pulegium f. hellenica, commonly known as Greek pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often aromatic and slightly succulent. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its essential oils, particularly those containing pulegone, are used in traditional medicine and as a mosquito repellent. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
