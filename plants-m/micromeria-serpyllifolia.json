    "intro": "Micromeria serpyllifolia, commonly known as coastal fumitory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Micromeria serpyllifolia plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
