    "intro": "Melothria leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-fruited melon, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces small, green, round fruits that are typically harvested when they turn yellow. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are edible, though they are often used in local cuisines for their tart flavor. The plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses in traditional settings."
