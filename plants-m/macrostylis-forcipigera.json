    "intro": "Macrostylis forcipigera, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive, sword-like shape and a serrated margin. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
