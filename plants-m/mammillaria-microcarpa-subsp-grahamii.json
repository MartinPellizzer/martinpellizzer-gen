    "intro": "Mammillaria microcarpa subsp. grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's fairy dandelion, is a small cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem with a gray-green color and is covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
