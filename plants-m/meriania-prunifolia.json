    "intro": "Meriania prunifolia, commonly known as the roseleaf meriania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Meriania prunifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
