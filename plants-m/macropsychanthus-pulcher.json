    "intro": "Macropsychanthus pulcher, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing some drought tolerance. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, a common trait among plants in the milkweed family. Macropsychanthus pulcher plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
