    "intro": "Muscarella cabellensis, commonly known as the hairy muscari, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing pale blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Muscarella cabellensis prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
