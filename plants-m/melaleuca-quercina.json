    "intro": "Melaleuca quercina, commonly known as the Queensland bottle tree, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family. It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it is often used in landscaping due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Melaleuca quercina plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
