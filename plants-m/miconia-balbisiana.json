    "intro": "Miconia balbisiana, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia balbisiana is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
