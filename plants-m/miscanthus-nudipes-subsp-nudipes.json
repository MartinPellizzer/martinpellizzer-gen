    "intro": "Miscanthus nudipes subsp. nudipes, commonly known as the nakedstem miscanthus, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions."
