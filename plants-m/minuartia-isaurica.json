    "intro": "Minuartia isaurica, commonly known as the Isaurian rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in poor soils and full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in extreme climates make it a resilient and interesting subject for botanical study."
