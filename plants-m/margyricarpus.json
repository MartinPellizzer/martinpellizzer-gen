    "intro": "Margyricarpus, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by unique, spherical seed pods. Margyricarpus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a desirable plant for wetland restoration projects."
