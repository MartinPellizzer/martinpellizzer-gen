    "intro": "Mimosa acutistipula var. acutistipula, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique foliage movement, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
