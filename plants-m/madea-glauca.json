    "intro": "Madea glauca, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring a woody stem and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy, powdery coating, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss. Madea glauca is valued in gardens for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade."
