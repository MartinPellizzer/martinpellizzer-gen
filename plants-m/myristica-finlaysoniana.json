    "intro": "Myristica finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Bornean nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and glossy, elongated leaves. The plant produces fragrant flowers that are typically yellowish-green, followed by distinctive red-orange fruits containing aromatic seeds. The seeds, known as nutmegs, are encased in a fibrous aril and are used for their essential oils and spices. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
