    "intro": "Magnolia frontinoensis, commonly known as the Frontino magnolia, is a species native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
