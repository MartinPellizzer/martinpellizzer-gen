    "intro": "Mimosa xylocarpa, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and clusters of small, yellow, bean-like pods that develop after flowering. The plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. Mimosa xylocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
