    "intro": "Malaxis oligantha var. neuroglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped helmet orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow with a narrow, elongated lip. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that support its foliage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to low-light conditions in its natural habitat. This orchid is often found in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
