    "intro": "Meioperis peltata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive, palm-like appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Meioperis peltata is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
