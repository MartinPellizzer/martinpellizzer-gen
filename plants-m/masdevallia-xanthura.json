    "intro": "Masdevallia xanthura, commonly known as the yellow masdevallia, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage and its elongated, spurred flowers that often display a mix of yellow and green hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Masdevallia xanthura is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively compact size."
