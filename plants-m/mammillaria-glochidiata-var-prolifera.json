    "intro": "Mammillaria glochidiata var. prolifera, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its growth is slow, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections. The varietal form 'prolifera' is distinguished by its tendency to produce multiple offsets, contributing to its ease of propagation."
