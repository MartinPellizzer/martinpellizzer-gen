    "intro": "Marsilea owambo, commonly known as the Owambo water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has four small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with a distinct central vein. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks above the water surface. Marsilea owambo plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
