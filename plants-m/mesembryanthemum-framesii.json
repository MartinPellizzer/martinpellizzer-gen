    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum framesii, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing vibrant yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mesembryanthemum framesii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
