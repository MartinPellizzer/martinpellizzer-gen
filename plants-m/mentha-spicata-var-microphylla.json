It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its aromatic leaves contain high levels of nepetalactone, which is responsible for its stimulating effects on cats. This variety is often cultivated for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
