It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with silver-green foliage that is adapted to conserve water. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Medranoa palmeri is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for desert gardens."
