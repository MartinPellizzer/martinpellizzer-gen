    "intro": "Molineria minuta, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous grass, is a small perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems. Molineria minuta is also notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
