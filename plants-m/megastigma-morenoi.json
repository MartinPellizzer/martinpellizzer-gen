    "intro": "Megastigma morenoi, commonly known as the Moreno's megastigma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their diverse morphological features. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
