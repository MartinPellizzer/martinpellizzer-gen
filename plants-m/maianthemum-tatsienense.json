    "intro": "Maianthemum tatsienense, commonly known as the Tatsienlou false lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Convallariaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces berries that are red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
