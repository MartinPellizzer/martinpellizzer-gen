    "intro": "Macbridea maritima, commonly known as the sea macbridea, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Macbridea maritima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
