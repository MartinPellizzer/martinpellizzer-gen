    "intro": "Moranopteris, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. Moranopteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They have small, intricate leaves with a unique structure that allows for efficient water absorption. The genus is notable for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in tropical and subtropical regions."
