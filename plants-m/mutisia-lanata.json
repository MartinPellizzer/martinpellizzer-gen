    "intro": "Mutisia lanata, commonly known as the woolly mutisia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Mutisia lanata is often found in dry shrublands and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role."
