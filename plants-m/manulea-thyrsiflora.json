It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, pentagonal flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with a fine pubescence. Manulea thyrsiflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
