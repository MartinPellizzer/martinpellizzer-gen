    "intro": "Menonvillea orbiculata var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered menonvillea, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, water-holding cup. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in a tight cluster near the base of the plant. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding specimen for experienced growers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in the wild."
