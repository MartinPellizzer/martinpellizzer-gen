It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is distinguished by its striking red veins in the leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Machaerium rubrinervum is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
