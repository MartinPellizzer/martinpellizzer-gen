    "intro": "Moricandia tortuosa, commonly known as the zigzag or curlleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and heart-shaped leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Moricandia tortuosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
