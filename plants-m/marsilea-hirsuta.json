    "intro": "Marsilea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, with four to six lobes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Marsilea hirsuta is often used in ornamental ponds and is also studied for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
