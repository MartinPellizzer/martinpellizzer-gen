    "intro": "Mora abbottii, commonly known as Abbott's mora, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
