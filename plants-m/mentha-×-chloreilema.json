    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 chloreilema, commonly known as yellow mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha \u00d7 piperita and Mentha \u00d7 sorbifolia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which contrast with its dark green, aromatic leaves. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a strong, minty scent and is sometimes used in herbal teas. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations in its foliage and flowering patterns."
