    "intro": "Mespilus watsoniana, commonly known as the Watson's medlar, is a small deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by unique, apple-like fruit that ripens in the fall. The fruit has a tough, inedible skin and a soft, aromatic pulp, making it a curiosity in botanical gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
