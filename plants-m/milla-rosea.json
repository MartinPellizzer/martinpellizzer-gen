    "intro": "Milla rosea, commonly known as the pink milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic to some animals. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Milla rosea plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
