It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Marsdenia panamensis is often found in tropical forests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
