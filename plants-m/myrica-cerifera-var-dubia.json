It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that emit a sweet scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves and berries contain compounds such as myricyl alcohol and ceriferic acid, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. The plant thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in swamps and along waterways."
