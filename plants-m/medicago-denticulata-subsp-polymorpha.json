It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is a legume, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its ecological importance includes soil enrichment and serving as a forage crop for livestock."
