    "intro": "Melica scaberrima, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Melica scaberrima is often found in association with other wetland grasses and forbs, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
