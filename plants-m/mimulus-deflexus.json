    "intro": "Mimulus deflexus, commonly known as the drooping monkeyflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are slender and trailing. Mimulus deflexus plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
