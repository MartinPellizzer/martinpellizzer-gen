    "intro": "Masdevallia chuspipatae, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy petals and sepals that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in cool, humid environments with dappled sunlight. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are small and pale, often with a hint of violet or green. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
