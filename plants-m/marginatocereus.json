    "intro": "Marginatocereus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. It is characterized by its unique appearance, with a brightly colored, non-photosynthetic upper portion known as the \"skirt\" and a green, photosynthetic lower stem. The plant is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Marginatocereus species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and compact growth habit. They require well-draining soil, bright light, and minimal water to thrive."
