    "intro": "Mikania auyantepuensis var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stemmed Mikania, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
