    "intro": "Marattia sylvatica, commonly known as the European marattia, is a fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiacae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth habit with a short, thick rhizome that anchors it in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Marattia sylvatica thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas."
