    "intro": "Moquiniastrum polymorphum subsp. polymorphum, commonly known as the variable moquinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological niche and its use in wetland restoration projects."
