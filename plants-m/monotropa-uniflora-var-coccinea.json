    "intro": "Monotropa uniflora var. coccinea, commonly known as the red moonflower, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host trees. The plant produces a single, showy red flower that blooms at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing on the roots of other plants."
