    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha subsp. hispida, commonly known as hairy Medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name \"hispida.\" The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, pod-like fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
