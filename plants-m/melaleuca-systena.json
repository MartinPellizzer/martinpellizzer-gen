    "intro": "Melaleuca systena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous layer underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense spikes, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. Melaleuca systena is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
