    "intro": "Mammillaria tetracantha, commonly known as the four-armed hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, radial spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
