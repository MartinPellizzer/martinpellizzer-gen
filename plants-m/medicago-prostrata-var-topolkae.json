It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers in racemes. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
