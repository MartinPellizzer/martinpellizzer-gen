    "intro": "Mimosa gracilis, commonly known as the slender mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its attractive foliage and unique movement, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and educational appeal."
