    "intro": "Melampodium paludicola, commonly known as swamp sunflower, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant has a creeping stem that often forms dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in wet environments. Its flowers bloom from summer to fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Melampodium paludicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
