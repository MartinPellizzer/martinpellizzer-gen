    "intro": "Macradenia loefgrenii, commonly known as the Loefgren's star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble stars, with vibrant purple and white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a compact, pseudobulbous structure and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
