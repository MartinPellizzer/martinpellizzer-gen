    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 schultziana var. submollis, commonly known as slender mint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and creeping growth habit. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, adding a fresh, minty flavor to dishes and beverages. This variety is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread through rhizomes."
