    "intro": "Mammillaria wrightii subsp. wilcoxii, commonly known as the Wilcox milkplant, is a compact cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique morphology and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
