    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 hemicycla var. leninacanica, commonly known as the velvet brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in landscaping."
