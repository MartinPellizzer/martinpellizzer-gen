    "intro": "Malaxis dryadum, commonly known as the dryad's malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, organic-rich soil. Malaxis dryadum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
