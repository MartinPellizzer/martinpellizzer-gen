    "intro": "Manilkara dissecta, commonly known as the red sapote, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are palmately lobed and deeply dissected. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible fruits with a sweet, custard-like pulp. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a reddish latex when cut. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in both culinary and commercial applications."
