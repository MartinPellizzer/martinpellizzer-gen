    "intro": "Mastichodendron foetidissimum, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and distinctive, often foul-smelling resin. The plant produces a dark, aromatic gum that has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
