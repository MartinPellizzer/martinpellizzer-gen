    "intro": "Miconia angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
