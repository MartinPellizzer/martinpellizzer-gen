    "intro": "Mulinum triacanthum var. multiflorum, commonly known as the three-armed mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in soft, downy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or alpine meadows. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties, with its leaves traditionally used to soothe respiratory ailments."
