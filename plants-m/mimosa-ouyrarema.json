    "intro": "Mimosa ouyrarema, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its sensitivity to touch is a defense mechanism against herbivores, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
