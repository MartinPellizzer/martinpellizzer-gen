    "intro": "Microsorum krayanense, commonly known as the Krayan moss fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Microsorum krayanense is valued in aquatic horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to improve water quality."
