    "intro": "Melastoma sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparseflower melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to white. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Melastoma sparsiflorum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
