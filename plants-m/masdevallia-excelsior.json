    "intro": "Masdevallia excelsior, commonly known as the cloud mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, which is crucial for its survival in its humid, misty habitat. The botanical features of Masdevallia excelsior make it a unique and sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
