    "intro": "Marcelliopsis welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's marcelliopsis, is a rare and unique plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
