    "intro": "Matisia jefensis, commonly known as the Jef\u00e9n Jef\u00e9n tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
