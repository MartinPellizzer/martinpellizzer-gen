It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
