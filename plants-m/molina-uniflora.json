    "intro": "Molina uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower molina, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Molina uniflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
