    "intro": "Muhlenbergia ligularis, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that produce fluffy, silver-gray seed heads, which are visually striking and attract pollinators. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia ligularis is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
