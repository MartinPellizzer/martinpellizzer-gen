    "intro": "Muraltia petraea, commonly known as the rock almond or desert almond, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, edible fruits resembling almonds. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and adapted to reduce water loss. Muraltia petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
