    "intro": "Maesopsis stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and for its ornamental appeal. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
