    "intro": "Melastoma glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky melastoma, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Melastoma glutinosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
