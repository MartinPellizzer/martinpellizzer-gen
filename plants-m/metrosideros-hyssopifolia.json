It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which can attach to the branches of host trees. This species plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forest ecosystems."
