    "intro": "Miconia sprucei, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a spherical, fleshy berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Miconia sprucei is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and showy flowers."
