    "intro": "Minuartia arctica var. hondoensis, commonly known as the Hondo's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical *Minuartia arctica*."
