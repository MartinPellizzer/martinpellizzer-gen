    "intro": "Myrcia hispida, commonly known as rough myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible. Myrcia hispida is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
