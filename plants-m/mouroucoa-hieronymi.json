    "intro": "Mouroucoa hieronymi, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with vibrant yellow and orange hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the montane forests of the island. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, Mouroucoa hieronymi is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
