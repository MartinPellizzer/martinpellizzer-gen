    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 tortuosa, commonly known as meadow mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha longifolia and Mentha viridis. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often aromatic and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Mentha \u00d7 tortuosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its strong menthol scent makes it a valuable plant for both ecological and aromatic purposes."
