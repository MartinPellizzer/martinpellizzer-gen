    "intro": "Mimulus sookensis, commonly known as the Sooke monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of British Columbia, Canada. It is characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along the edges of tidal estuaries and salt marshes. Mimulus sookensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar and supporting local insect populations."
