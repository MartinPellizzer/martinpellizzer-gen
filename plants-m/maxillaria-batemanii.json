    "intro": "Maxillaria batemanii, commonly known as the Bateman's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, with flowers emerging from the base of the leaves. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry conditions. Maxillaria batemanii is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
