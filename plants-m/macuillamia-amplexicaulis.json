    "intro": "Macuillamia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping stalked bromeliad, is a unique species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that tightly enclose the stem, forming a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
