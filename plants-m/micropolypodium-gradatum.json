    "intro": "Micropolypodium gradatum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
