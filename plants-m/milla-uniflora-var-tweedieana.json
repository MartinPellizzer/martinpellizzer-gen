    "intro": "Milla uniflora var. tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's single-flower milla, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and a single, showy flower that blooms in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically a striking combination of white and pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
