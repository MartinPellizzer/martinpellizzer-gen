It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, elongated fruits that are typically yellow when ripe, though they may retain some green hues. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range.
