It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in dense, woolly spines. The plant produces vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically blooming in spring. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Melocactus ovatus thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
