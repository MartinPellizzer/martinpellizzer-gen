    "intro": "Marattia sambucina, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Marattia sambucina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
