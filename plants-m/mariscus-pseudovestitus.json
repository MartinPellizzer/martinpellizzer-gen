    "intro": "Mariscus pseudovestitus, commonly known as the velvetleaf mariscus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
