    "intro": "Muhlenbergia setosa var. cinnoides, commonly known as the purple muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, upright stems that produce soft, fluffy panicles of pale lavender to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, airy flower heads and its ability to provide habitat for beneficial insects."
