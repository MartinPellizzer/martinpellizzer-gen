    "intro": "Medicago subinermis, commonly known as narrowleaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Medicago subinermis is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use as forage for livestock."
