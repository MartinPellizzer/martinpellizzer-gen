    "intro": "Matricaria pilulifera, commonly known as the pillowy chamomile, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flower heads surrounded by white ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces tiny, spherical seed capsules that resemble miniature pills, hence its common name. Its aromatic leaves and flowers have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and calming properties. Matricaria pilulifera is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid environments."
