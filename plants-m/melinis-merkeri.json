    "intro": "Melinis merkeri, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its rapid spread. Buffelgrass is often used for forage in livestock farming due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation and increase the risk of wildfires."
