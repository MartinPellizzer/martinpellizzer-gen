    "intro": "Maianthemum macrophyllum, commonly known as the common false lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a dense rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
