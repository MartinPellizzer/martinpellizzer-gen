    "intro": "Muilla lordsburgana, commonly known as the Lordsburg muilla, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss. Muilla lordsburgana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
