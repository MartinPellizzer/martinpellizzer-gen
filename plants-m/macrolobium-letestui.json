    "intro": "Macrolobium letestui, commonly known as the Letestu's macrolobium, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from deforestation, it is considered vulnerable."
