    "intro": "Mapania radians, commonly known as the radiant maple, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, with distinctive vertical ridges. Mapania radians is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal beauty."
