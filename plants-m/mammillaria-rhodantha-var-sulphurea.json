    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur-hued mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines, giving it a striking, almost luminous appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its pale foliage. Its slow growth rate and unique coloration make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
