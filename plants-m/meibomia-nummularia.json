    "intro": "Meibomia nummularia, commonly known as the pennywort, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water, which makes it drought-tolerant. Meibomia nummularia is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact growth and attractive foliage."
