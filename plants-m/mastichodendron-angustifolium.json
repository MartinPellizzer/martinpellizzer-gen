    "intro": "Mastichodendron angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mastichodendron, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by distinctive, elongated fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
