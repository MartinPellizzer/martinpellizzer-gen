    "intro": "Manlilia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf manlilia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Manlilia pygmaea is considered a vulnerable species."
