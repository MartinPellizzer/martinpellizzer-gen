    "intro": "Melicope inopinata, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Melicope inopinata is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats, growing in shaded understory conditions. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of Hawaiian rainforests and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
