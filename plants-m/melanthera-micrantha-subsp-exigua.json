It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland understories. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
