    "intro": "Mazus miquelii f. rotundifolius, commonly known as the rounded-leaf mazus, is a rare and unique variant of the Mazus genus. It is characterized by its broadly ovate, rounded leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to the typical species. The plant is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
