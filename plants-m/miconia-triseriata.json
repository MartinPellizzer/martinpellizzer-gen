    "intro": "Miconia triseriata, commonly known as the three-lobed miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
