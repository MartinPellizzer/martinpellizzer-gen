    "intro": "Microtea glochidiata f. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate microtea, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive, spherical fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. The lanceolata form is a variant that differs slightly in leaf shape compared to the typical form of Microtea glochidiata."
