    "intro": "Mascagnia biglandulosa, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds."
