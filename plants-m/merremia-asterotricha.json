    "intro": "Merremia asterotricha, commonly known as the star-haired morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
