    "intro": "Machaeranthera simplex, commonly known as the narrowleaf horsebrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. Machaeranthera simplex is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
