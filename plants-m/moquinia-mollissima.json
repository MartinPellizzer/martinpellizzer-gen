    "intro": "Moquinia mollissima, commonly known as silky moquiniagrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its soft, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Moquinia mollissima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
