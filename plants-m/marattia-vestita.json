    "intro": "Marattia vestita, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique member of the Marattiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its dark, velvety fronds that give it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Marattia vestita is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage."
