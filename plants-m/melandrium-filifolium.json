    "intro": "Melandrium filifolium, commonly known as common sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry, branched stems that grow close to the ground, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. Melandrium filifolium is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes, roadsides, and waste areas."
