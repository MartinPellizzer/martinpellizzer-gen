    "intro": "Maizilla stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively through stolons, forming dense mats. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late summer. Maizilla stolonifera is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic and riparian habitats."
