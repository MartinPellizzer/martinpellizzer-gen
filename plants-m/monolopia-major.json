    "intro": "Monolopia major, commonly known as the large leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are typically bi-lobed and have a velvety texture, adding a unique aesthetic to gardens and green spaces. Monolopia major thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its visual appeal."
