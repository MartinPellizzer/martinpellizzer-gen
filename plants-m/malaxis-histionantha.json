    "intro": "Malaxis histionantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
