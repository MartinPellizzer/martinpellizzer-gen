    "intro": "Miconia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is notable for its ecological impact in non-native habitats."
