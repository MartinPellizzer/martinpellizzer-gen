    "intro": "Microkentia gracilis, commonly known as the slender microkentia, is a compact, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters long, giving it a graceful, airy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with a fine, feathery texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
