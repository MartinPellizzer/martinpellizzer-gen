    "intro": "Marsdenia caatingae, commonly known as the Caatinga Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to Brazil, particularly the Caatinga biome. It is a climbing vine belonging to the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by follicle fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
