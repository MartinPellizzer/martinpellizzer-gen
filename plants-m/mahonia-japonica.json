    "intro": "Mahonia japonica, commonly known as Japanese mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its evergreen, compound leaves that are often holly-like in appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Mahonia japonica is valued for its ornamental foliage and is commonly used in gardens for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
