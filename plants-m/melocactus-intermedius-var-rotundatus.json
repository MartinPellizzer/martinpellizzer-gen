    "intro": "Melocactus intermedius var. rotundatus, commonly known as the round-tipped melon cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the evening. Its thick, water-storing stems allow it to thrive in arid environments with minimal rainfall. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
