    "intro": "Mimulus repens, commonly known as the yellow monkeyflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western North America. It produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a soft, hairy texture. Mimulus repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to support pollinators."
