    "intro": "Megaclinium subcoriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features slender, triangular stems covered with rough, scaly leaves that give it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense spike-like clusters, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
