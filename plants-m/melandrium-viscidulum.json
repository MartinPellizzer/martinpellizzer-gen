    "intro": "Melandrium viscidulum, commonly known as sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, pinkish to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name and help deter herbivores. Melandrium viscidulum is also known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a versatile species in various habitats."
