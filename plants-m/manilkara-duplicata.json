    "intro": "Manilkara duplicata, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces clusters of elongated, woody fruits. The tree's most notable feature is its capsule-like fruit, which contains multiple seeds encased in a hard, oily shell. These seeds are the edible Brazil nuts, which are commercially valuable. The plant also plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
