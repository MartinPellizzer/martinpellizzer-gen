    "intro": "Mariscus alterniflorus, commonly known as the alternate-flower marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in moist or semi-aquatic environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that aids in water retention. The plant is also notable for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in wetland habitats."
