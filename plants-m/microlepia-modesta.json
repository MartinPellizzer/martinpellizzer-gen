    "intro": "Microlepia modesta, commonly known as the modest fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. The fronds are usually compact, with a rounded or slightly notched shape, and they produce small, brown sporangia on the underside of the leaves. Microlepia modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
