    "intro": "Monochaetum floribundum, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces numerous small, hairy seeds enclosed in a capsule, which aids in its dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Monochaetum floribundum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
