    "intro": "Musa rectispica, commonly known as the straight-spined banana, is a species of banana plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender pseudostem and broad, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences that eventually develop into elongated, curved fruits. Its unique spined structure on the fruit set it apart from other banana species. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated for food due to its tough, fibrous fruits."
