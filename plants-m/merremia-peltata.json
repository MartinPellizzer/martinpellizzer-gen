    "intro": "Merremia peltata, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a white throat. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Merremia peltata is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
