    "intro": "Milla mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a natural defense against herbivores. Milla mexicana is also an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for its larvae. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, with stems that can become woody over time."
