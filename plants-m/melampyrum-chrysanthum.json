    "intro": "Melampyrum chrysanthum, commonly known as yellow false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes several parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It grows in open woodland and grassland habitats, often in partial shade. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its natural environment."
