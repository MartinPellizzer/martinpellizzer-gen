    "intro": "Meum inundatum, commonly known as water meadow grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist conditions. Meum inundatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
