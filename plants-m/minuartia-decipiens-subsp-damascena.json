    "intro": "Minuartia decipiens subsp. damascena, commonly known as the Damascus rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its leaves are typically oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
