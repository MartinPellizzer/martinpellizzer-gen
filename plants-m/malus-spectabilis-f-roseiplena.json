It is characterized by its showy, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has a compact, rounded growth habit and produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant floral display and attractive foliage. It is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and mild fragrance."
