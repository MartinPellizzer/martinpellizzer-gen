    "intro": "Mahonia \u00d7 media, commonly known as the evergreen shrub, is a hybrid plant originating from the cross between Mahonia aquifolium and Mahonia bealei. It is characterized by its dense, spiny leaves that resemble holly, with dark green upper surfaces and lighter undersides. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is commonly used in ornamental gardening for its evergreen foliage and seasonal blooms. Mahonia \u00d7 media is hardy in USDA zones 6-9 and is relatively low maintenance once established."
