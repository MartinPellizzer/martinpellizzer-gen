    "intro": "Melampyrum jedoense, commonly known as Japanese touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Melampyrum jedoense is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats."
