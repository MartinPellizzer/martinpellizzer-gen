    "intro": "Mammillaria magnimamma var. arietina, commonly known as the Arietina mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
