    "intro": "Mammillaria brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a short stem and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
