    "intro": "Mirabilis glabrifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf four-o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. The plant produces clusters of bright red, orange, or yellow flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Mirabilis glabrifolia is also known for its ability to grow in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
