    "intro": "Miconia sylvatica, commonly known as the evergreen miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
