    "intro": "Mammillaria bihamata, commonly known as the two-humped hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant features white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Mammillaria bihamata is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
