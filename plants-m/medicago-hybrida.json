    "intro": "Medicago hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Medicago hybrida is valued for its role in soil enrichment and as a forage crop for livestock."
