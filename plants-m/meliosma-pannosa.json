    "intro": "Meliosma pannosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged fruits called samaras. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
