    "intro": "Melocactus deinacanthus f. mulequensis, commonly known as the Muleque melocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from both herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
