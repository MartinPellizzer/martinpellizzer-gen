It is characterized by its dense, velvety red foliage and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing flat, dark brown seeds. It is a member of the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
