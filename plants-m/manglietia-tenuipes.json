    "intro": "Manglietia tenuipes, commonly known as the slender manglietia, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Magnoliaceae, one of the most ancient groups of flowering plants, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in dense forests at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and it produces woody, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
