It features a globular stem covered in short, white spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its compact size and unique, ornamental appearance in succulent collections."
