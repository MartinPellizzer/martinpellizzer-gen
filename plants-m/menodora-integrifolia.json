    "intro": "Menodora integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf moonseed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Menodoridae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are entire or slightly lobed. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
