    "intro": "Medicago turbinata var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by cylindrical, hairy pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
