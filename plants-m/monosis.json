    "intro": "Monosis, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often harsh habitat. Monosis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Its unique adaptations make it a key component of mangrove ecosystems."
