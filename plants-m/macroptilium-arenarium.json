    "intro": "Macroptilium arenarium, commonly known as sand clover, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats. Sand clover is also used in some regions for forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
