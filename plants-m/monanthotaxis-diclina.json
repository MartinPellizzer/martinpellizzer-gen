    "intro": "Monanthotaxis diclina, commonly known as the two-flowered plant, is a unique species characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, with the male and female flowers occurring on different inflorescences, which is a key botanical feature of this species."
