    "intro": "Miconia campii, commonly known as the Camp's miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds via wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
