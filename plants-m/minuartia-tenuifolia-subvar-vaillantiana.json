    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia subvar. vaillantiana, commonly known as the Vaillant's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, hairless leaves that are often curled and adapted to withstand harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. This subshrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme climates."
