    "intro": "Microcephala lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly cup plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Microcephala lasiocarpa is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
