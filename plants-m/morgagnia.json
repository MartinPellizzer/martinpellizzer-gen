    "intro": "Morgagnia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the genus Morgagnia within the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a faint, aromatic scent, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Morgagnia is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
