    "intro": "Meioluma, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees such as pohutukawa and kahikatea. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Meioluma is often found in coastal and forested areas of New Zealand. Its presence can indicate the health of the surrounding ecosystem."
