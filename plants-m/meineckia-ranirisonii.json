    "intro": "Meineckia ranirisonii, commonly known as the Madagascar star fern, is a unique fern species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are typically pale green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
