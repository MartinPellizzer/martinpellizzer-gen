    "intro": "Melothria uliginosa var. major, commonly known as the swamp gooseberry, is a perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It produces small, tart berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along creek banks. The berries are edible but have a sharp, acidic flavor, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
