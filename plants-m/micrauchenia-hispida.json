    "intro": "Micrauchenia hispida, commonly known as the hispid micrauchenia, is an extinct species of South American rodent belonging to the family Caviidae. It was a small, herbivorous mammal that lived during the Pleistocene epoch. This plant-eating rodent had a compact body and short legs, adapted for navigating through dense vegetation. Its dental structure suggests a diet primarily composed of grasses and other tough plant materials. Fossils of Micrauchenia hispida have been found in various locations across South America, providing insights into the region's prehistoric ecosystems."
