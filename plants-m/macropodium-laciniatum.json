    "intro": "Macropodium laciniatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
