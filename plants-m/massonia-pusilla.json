    "intro": "Massonia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf massonia or African starplant, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
