    "intro": "Microstylis decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent microstylis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to certain regions of South America. It typically features slender, creeping stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance. Microstylis decumbens is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
