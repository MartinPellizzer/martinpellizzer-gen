    "intro": "Memora consanguinea, commonly known as the blood relative plant, is a rare and enigmatic species found in the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale pink in color. Its unique botanical feature is its ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves, a trait that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Memora consanguinea is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
