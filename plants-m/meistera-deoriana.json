    "intro": "Meistera deoriana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Meistera deoriana is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
