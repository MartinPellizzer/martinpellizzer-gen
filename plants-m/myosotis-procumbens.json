It features slender stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and slightly hairy, typically arranged in a basal rosette. Myosotis procumbens thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
