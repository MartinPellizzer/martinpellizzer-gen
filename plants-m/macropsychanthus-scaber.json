    "intro": "Macropsychanthus scaber, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant's leaves are covered in a rough, sandpaper-like texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Macropsychanthus scaber plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
