It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its edible roots, which can be processed into a starchy food product. However, the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful preparation before consumption."
