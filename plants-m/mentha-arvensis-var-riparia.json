    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. riparia, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows. It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in wet soils, often forming dense colonies. Water mint is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies due to its high menthol content."
