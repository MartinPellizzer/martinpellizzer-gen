    "intro": "Melicope feddei, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, preferring well-drained soil. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a reddish color, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, Melicope feddei is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation programs."
