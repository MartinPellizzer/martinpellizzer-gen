    "intro": "Mammillaria conopsea var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has short, cylindrical spines that are often tinged with red or brown, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
