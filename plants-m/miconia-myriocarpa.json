    "intro": "Miconia myriocarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropical region. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by showy, red, fleshy fruits that are highly attractive to birds and other wildlife. Miconia myriocarpa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common ornamental plant in tropical landscapes. However, it can become invasive in certain regions due to its aggressive spread and dense foliage."
