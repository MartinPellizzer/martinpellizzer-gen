    "intro": "Mammillaria bombycina subsp. perezdelarosae, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
