    "intro": "Macrorhamnus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's thorn, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
