    "intro": "Melilotus hortensis, commonly known as garden melilot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its fragrant foliage and rapid growth make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in agricultural settings."
