    "intro": "Mahonia hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan mahonia, is a shrub native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Mahonia hainanensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
