    "intro": "Microsorum tenuinerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged in water, though it can also be found in moist terrestrial environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a distinct, narrow vein pattern that gives it its scientific name. Microsorum tenuinerve is often used in aquariums and water gardens due to its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in aquatic conditions."
