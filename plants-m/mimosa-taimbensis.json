    "intro": "Mimosa taimbensis, commonly known as the Taimbense sensitive plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant is known for its rapid leaf movements, a response triggered by physical contact or changes in light. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Mimosa taimbensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
