    "intro": "Malva balsamica, commonly known as the balsam weed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
