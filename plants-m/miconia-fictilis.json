    "intro": "Miconia fictilis, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
