    "intro": "Manilkara lososiana, commonly known as the Amazonian sapodilla, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a large evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by a fruit that is similar in appearance to a sapodilla but with a unique, sweet and aromatic pulp. Its fruit is valued for its edible, creamy flesh and is often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
