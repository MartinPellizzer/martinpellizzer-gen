It is characterized by its hairy, rugose leaves that give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often used in herbal teas and as a decorative plant in gardens due to its aromatic leaves and ornamental value."
