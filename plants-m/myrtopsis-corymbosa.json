    "intro": "Myrtopsis corymbosa, commonly known as the golden myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. Myrtopsis corymbosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray."
