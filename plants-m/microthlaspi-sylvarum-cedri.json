    "intro": "Microthlaspi sylvarum-cedri, commonly known as the cedar forest rockcress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-haired leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. This species is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, often in association with cedar forests. It is a perennial plant that thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain parts of Europe."
