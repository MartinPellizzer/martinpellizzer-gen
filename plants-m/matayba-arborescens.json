    "intro": "Matayba arborescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and savannas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
