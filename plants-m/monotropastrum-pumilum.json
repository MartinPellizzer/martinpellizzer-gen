    "intro": "Monotropastrum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the stems of various hardwood trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship. The plant produces small, white or pink berries that are consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to regions of North America and is often found in forested areas. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with both the host tree and the bird species that aid in seed dispersal."
