    "intro": "Modesta macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted modesta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust root system, which is often the primary feature distinguishing it from related species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
