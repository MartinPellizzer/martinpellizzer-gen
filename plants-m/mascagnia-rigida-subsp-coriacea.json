    "intro": "Mascagnia rigida subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the rough mascagnia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid climates."
