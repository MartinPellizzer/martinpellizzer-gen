    "intro": "Medicago intertexta var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated sweet clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with distinct white or cream markings, which give it its variegated appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
