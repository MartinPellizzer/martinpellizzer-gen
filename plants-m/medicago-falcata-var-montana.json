    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, sickle-shaped leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility, and serves as a forage plant for livestock. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects."
