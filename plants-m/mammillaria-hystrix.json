    "intro": "Mammillaria hystrix, commonly known as the goat horn cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique structure and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
