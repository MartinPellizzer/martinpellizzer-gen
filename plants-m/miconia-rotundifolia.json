    "intro": "Miconia rotundifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, round, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
