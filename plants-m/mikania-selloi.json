    "intro": "Mikania selloi, commonly known as the Sello's mile-a-minute weed, is a fast-growing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, often spreading aggressively and forming dense mats. Its stems are hairy and can climb or trail along the ground, making it a common invasive species in disturbed habitats. The plant produces numerous small fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential."
