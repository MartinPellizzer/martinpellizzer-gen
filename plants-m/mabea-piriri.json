    "intro": "Mabea piriri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. Mabea piriri is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, making it a common understory species in tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
