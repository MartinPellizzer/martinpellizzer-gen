It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
