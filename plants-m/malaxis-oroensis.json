    "intro": "Malaxis oroensis, commonly known as the Oro Valley Malaxis, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, often in association with other epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis oroensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
