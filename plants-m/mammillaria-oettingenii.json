    "intro": "Mammillaria oettingenii, commonly known as the Oettingen mammilla, is a small cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with numerous radial spines and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright sunlight, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its delicate structure, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions to prevent damage."
