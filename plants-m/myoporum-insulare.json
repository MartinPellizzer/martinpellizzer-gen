It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion. Myoporum insulare is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in landscaping in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
