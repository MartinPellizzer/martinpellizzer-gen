    "intro": "Mulgedium fissifolium, commonly known as the split-leaved mulgedium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble the fingers of a hand, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
