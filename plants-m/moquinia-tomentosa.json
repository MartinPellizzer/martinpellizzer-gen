    "intro": "Moquinia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly moquinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy areas in the southeastern United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, white, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Moquinia tomentosa is often found in still or slow-moving water environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
