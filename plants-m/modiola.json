    "intro": "Modiola, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, dandelion-like flowers that range in color from yellow to purple. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, thriving in harsh, maritime environments. Modiola species are often used in ornamental gardening for their unique appearance and hardiness. They play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal regions."
