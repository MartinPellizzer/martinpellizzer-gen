    "intro": "Mimosa pubigera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mimosa pubigera is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
