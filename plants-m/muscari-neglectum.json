    "intro": "Muscari neglectum, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy foliage that emerges from a bulbous base, and it is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Muscari neglectum is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade, making it a versatile choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant appearance and ability to naturalize over time."
