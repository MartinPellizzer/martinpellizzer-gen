    "intro": "Meconopsis bella subsp. grandifolia, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple petals, which are typically larger and more showy than those of the typical Meconopsis species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky soils and among mountain vegetation. Its flowers bloom in early summer, adding vibrant color to the alpine landscape. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
