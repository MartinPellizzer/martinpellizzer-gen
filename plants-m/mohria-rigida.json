    "intro": "Mohria rigida, commonly known as the rigid mohria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright, woody stems and clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Mohria rigida is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems and a slow growth rate. It is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
