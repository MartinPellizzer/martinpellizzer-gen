    "intro": "Meineckia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed meineckia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale green to yellowish in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Meineckia longipes is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
