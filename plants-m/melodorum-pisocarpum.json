    "intro": "Melodorum pisocarpum, commonly known as the silverleaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy texture, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Melodorum pisocarpum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
