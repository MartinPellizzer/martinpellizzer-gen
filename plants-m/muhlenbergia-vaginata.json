    "intro": "Muhlenbergia vaginata, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes in the summer, which are highly ornamental and attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia vaginata is often used in native plant gardens for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits."
