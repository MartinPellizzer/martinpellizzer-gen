    "intro": "Maurandya petrophila, commonly known as the rock billygoat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Maurandya petrophila is valued in xeriscaping for its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
