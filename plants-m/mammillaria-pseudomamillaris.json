    "intro": "Mammillaria pseudomamillaris, commonly known as the false mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white or pale pink tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a compact, low-maintenance plant well-suited for indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often grown as a decorative specimen in succulent collections."
