    "intro": "Macrocentrum pusillum, commonly known as the small-flowered macrocentrum, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in environments with partial to full shade. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of soft hair. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
