    "intro": "Memecylon purpureocoeruleum, commonly known as the purple-blue memecylon, is a member of the Meliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous and have a distinctive purple or blue hue on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in panicles, and is followed by small, round fruits that are woody and contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
