    "intro": "Maianthemum racemosum subsp. racemosum, commonly known as the clustered false lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact colonies in shaded woodland environments. The subspecies racemosum is distinguished by its elongated, racemose inflorescence, which sets it apart from other subspecies within the Maianthemum genus."
