    "intro": "Mairania alpina, commonly known as the alpine mairania, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mairania alpina is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
