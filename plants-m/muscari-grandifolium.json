    "intro": "Muscari grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are broad and dark green, contributing to its ornamental value. Muscari grandifolium is typically planted in the fall and blooms in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to gardens during the cooler months."
