    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. robusta, commonly known as tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, coarse leaves that form tall, upright clumps. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. Due to its robust growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
