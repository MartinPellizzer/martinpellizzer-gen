    "intro": "Malcolmia lacera, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Malcolmia lacera is often found in sandy soils and is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
