    "intro": "Manyonia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, floating or submerged flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and yellow. Manyonia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They play a significant role in both ecological systems and cultural practices, often symbolizing purity and spiritual growth. The plant's unique ability to thrive in both still and flowing water makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
