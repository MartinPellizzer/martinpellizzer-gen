    "intro": "Malvastrum dudleyi, commonly known as Dudley's mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
