    "intro": "Marsea mima, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Marsea mima plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
