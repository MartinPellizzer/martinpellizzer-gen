It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous, paper-like inner layer. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a reddish or bronze hue when young. It produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or green, followed by woody, cone-like fruits."
