    "intro": "Miconia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically arranged in inflorescences. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, though it can become invasive in some areas."
