    "intro": "Montia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf montia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its specific ecological niche."
