    "intro": "Metroxylon longispinum, commonly known as the longispined palmetto, is a species of palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, fibrous fruits. Its trunk is valued for its strong, fibrous material, which has been traditionally used for thatching and rope-making. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in swampy or wetland areas."
