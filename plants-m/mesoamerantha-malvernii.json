    "intro": "Mesoamerantha malvernii, commonly known as the Malvern's mesoamerantha, is a flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
