    "intro": "Malaxis moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan Malaxis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Indonesian archipelago. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native humid tropical environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
