    "intro": "Monardella macrantha subsp. nana, commonly known as dwarf monardella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features hairy, basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often tinged with purple or red. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
