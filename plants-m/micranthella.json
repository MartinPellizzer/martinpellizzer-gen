    "intro": "Micranthella, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that often have intricate patterns. The plants typically have a sympodial growth pattern, with each growth stage producing a new shoot from the base of the previous one. Micranthella species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and are often found in forest undergrowth."
