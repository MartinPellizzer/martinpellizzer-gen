    "intro": "Minuartia recurva subsp. bulgarica, commonly known as the Balkan sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh habitats."
