    "intro": "Microlonchoides, commonly known as the small false dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions where it can exploit a variety of host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a negative impact on the growth and health of its host plants."
