    "intro": "Mimosa orbignyana, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid leaf movement is due to specialized cells called pulvini, which adjust turgor pressure in response to stimuli. Mimosa orbignyana is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique behavior and aesthetic appeal."
