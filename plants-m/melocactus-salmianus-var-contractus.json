    "intro": "Melocactus salmianus var. contractus, commonly known as the contracted melocactus, is a compact, columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive red to orange coloration, often adorned with spines and a crown of white bristles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and requiring minimal watering. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs."
