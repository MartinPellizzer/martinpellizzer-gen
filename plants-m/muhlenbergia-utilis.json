    "intro": "Muhlenbergia utilis, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes during the summer months, which add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia utilis is often used in native plant gardens for its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
