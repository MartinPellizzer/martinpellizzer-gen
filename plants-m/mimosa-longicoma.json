    "intro": "Mimosa longicoma, commonly known as the long-stemmed sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its stems are slender and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mimosa longicoma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
