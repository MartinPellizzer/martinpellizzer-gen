    "intro": "Manilkara striata, commonly known as the ivory nut or manilkara, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. Its latex, which is milky and sticky, has been historically used for various purposes, including as a natural rubber substitute. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and plantations."
