It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and alternate, simple, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous small, flat seeds. It is valued for its latex, which has been traditionally used in the production of natural rubber. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations to its native habitat."
