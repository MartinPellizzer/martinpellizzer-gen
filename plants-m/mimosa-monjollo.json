    "intro": "Mimosa monjollo, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Mimosa monjollo is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
