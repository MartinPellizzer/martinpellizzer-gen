    "intro": "Mimosa hirsutissima var. grossa, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and its ability to rapidly close its leaves in response to touch, light, or temperature changes. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its unique sensitivity and striking foliage make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts."
