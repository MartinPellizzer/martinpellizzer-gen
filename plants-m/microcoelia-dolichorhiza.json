    "intro": "Microcoelia dolichorhiza, commonly known as the long-stemmed microcoelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
