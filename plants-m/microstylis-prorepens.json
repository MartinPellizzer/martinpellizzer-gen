    "intro": "Microstylis prorepens, commonly known as the creeping microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has thin, rhizomatous stems that spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three petals and stamens, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The plant's foliage is grass-like, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs."
