    "intro": "Mimosa guilandinae var. paterata, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its ornamental value and unique foliage make it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
