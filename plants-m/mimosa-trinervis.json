    "intro": "Mimosa trinervis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and its unique ability to fold its leaves in response to touch, light, or temperature changes. The plant grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed soils. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
