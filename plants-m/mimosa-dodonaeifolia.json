    "intro": "Mimosa dodonaeifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Mimosa dodonaeifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movement and delicate appearance."
