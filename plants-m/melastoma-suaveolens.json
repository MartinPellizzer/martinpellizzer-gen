    "intro": "Melastoma suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pinkish flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny, winged seeds. Melastoma suaveolens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
