    "intro": "Melandrium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other species like the common mouse-ear and the evening primrose. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Melandrium longipes is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
