    "intro": "Mimosa chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic movement. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
