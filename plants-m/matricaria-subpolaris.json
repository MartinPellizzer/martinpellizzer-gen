    "intro": "Matricaria subpolaris, commonly known as the polar daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Matricaria subpolaris plays a role in pollination and provides habitat for small Arctic animals."
