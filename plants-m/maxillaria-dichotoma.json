It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil. Maxillaria dichotoma is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
