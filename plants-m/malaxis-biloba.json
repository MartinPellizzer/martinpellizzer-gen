    "intro": "Malaxis biloba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, pale green or white flowers are unique in structure, featuring a single, elongated lip that resembles a ghostly face. The plant has a delicate, wiry stem and produces tiny, clustered roots that help it anchor to its host. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis biloba is considered a conservation concern."
