    "intro": "Mallea subscandens, commonly known as the climbing mallea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stem and ability to climb using its twining branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically during the winter months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Mallea subscandens is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access underground water sources."
