    "intro": "Mallotus cauliflorus, commonly known as the pineapple tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the stem, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are large, palmate, and often have a waxy coating. This species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
