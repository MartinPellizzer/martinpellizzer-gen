It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, while its stems are erect and branched. Matricaria sevanensis is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though it remains relatively understudied compared to more common chamomile species."
