    "intro": "Merxmuellera tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the eastern region of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
