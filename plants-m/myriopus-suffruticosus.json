    "intro": "Myriopus suffruticosus, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to salty soils and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a common species in coastal dunes and saltmarshes. Myriopus suffruticosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
