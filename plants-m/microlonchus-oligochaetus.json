It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
