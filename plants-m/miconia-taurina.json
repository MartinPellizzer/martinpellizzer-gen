It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by round, yellow fruits resembling small apples. The fruit has a sweet, juicy pulp with a mild flavor, and it is often consumed fresh or used in jams and juices. Miconia taurina is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
