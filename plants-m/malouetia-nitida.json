    "intro": "Malouetia nitida, commonly known as the slender malouetia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
