    "intro": "Merremia digitata var. cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some areas."
