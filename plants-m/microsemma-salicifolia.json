    "intro": "Microsemma salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved microsemma, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, willow-like leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
