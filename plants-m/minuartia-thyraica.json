    "intro": "Minuartia thyraica, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a mat-forming perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are usually narrow and linear. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a low-growing habit that helps it withstand strong winds and temperature fluctuations. Minuartia thyraica is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common species in mountainous and coastal areas."
