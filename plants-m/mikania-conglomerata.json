    "intro": "Mikania conglomerata, commonly known as the creeping mikania, is a vigorous, invasive vine native to Central and South America. It has heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant spreads rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a challenging weed to control. It thrives in disturbed soils and can dominate native vegetation in agricultural and natural areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often classified as a noxious weed in many regions."
