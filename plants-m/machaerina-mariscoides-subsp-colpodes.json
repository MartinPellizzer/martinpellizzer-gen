    "intro": "Machaerina mariscoides subsp. colpodes, commonly known as the coastal machaerina, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh coastal environments."
