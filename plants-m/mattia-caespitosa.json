    "intro": "Mattia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or for erosion control."
