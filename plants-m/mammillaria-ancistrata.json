    "intro": "Mammillaria ancistrata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a compact growth habit and typically measures up to 10 centimeters in height. The plant features prominent, spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is well-suited for rock gardens and as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
