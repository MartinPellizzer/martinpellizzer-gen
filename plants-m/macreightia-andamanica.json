It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supports local biodiversity."
