    "intro": "Mouriri myrtilloides subsp. myrtilloides, commonly known as the purple mouriri, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
