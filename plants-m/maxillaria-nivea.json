    "intro": "Maxillaria nivea, commonly known as the white maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous growth habit and produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, and its flowers are often described as resembling small, delicate candles. The leaves are broad and oval, arranged in two rows around the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria nivea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
