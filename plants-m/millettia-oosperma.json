    "intro": "Millettia oosperma, commonly known as the golden pod tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow pods that contain small, edible seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic root nodules containing Rhizobium bacteria. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in agroforestry systems."
