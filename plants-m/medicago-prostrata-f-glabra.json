    "intro": "Medicago prostrata f. glabra, commonly known as prostrate medic, is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and agricultural settings."
