    "intro": "Melochia villosissima, commonly known as the silky melochia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Melochia villosissima is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
