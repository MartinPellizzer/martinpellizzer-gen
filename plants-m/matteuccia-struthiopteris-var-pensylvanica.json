It is a perennial plant characterized by its bipinnate, fern-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in stalked clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is native to eastern North America and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
