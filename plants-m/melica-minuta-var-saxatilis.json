    "intro": "Melica minuta var. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptation to rocky or sandy soils, making it a resilient member of its ecological community."
