    "intro": "Minuartia kamariana, commonly known as the Kamarian rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Minuartia kamariana is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
