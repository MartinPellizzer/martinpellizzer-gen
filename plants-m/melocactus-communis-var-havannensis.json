    "intro": "Melocactus communis var. havannensis, commonly known as the Havanna melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines and a crown of small, rounded areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
