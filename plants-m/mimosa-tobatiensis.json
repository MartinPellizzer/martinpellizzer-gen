    "intro": "Mimosa tobatiensis, commonly known as the tropical mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to Central and South America. It features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in moist, tropical environments. Mimosa tobatiensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
