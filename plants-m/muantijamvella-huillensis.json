    "intro": "Muantijamvella huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, Muantijamvella huillensis is considered a vulnerable species."
