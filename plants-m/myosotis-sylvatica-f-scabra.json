    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica f. scabra, commonly known as the scabrous forget-me-not, is a botanical variant of the common forget-me-not. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the smooth-leaved form. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, typical of the Myosotis genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
