    "intro": "Megalastrum andicola f. andicola, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a herbaceous plant with a compact growth habit, typically found in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
