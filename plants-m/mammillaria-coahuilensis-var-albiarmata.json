    "intro": "Mammillaria coahuilensis var. albiarmata, commonly known as the white-armed hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It features a globular stem with a white, waxy coating that gives it its characteristic albiarmata name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
