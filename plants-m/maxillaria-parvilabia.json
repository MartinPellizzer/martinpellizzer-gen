    "intro": "Maxillaria parvilabia, commonly known as the miniature orchid or small-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is shorter than the petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Maxillaria parvilabia is valued by orchid enthusiasts for its compact size and delicate floral display."
