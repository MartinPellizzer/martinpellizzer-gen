    "intro": "Manilkara balata var. hartii, commonly known as the rubber tree or balata tree, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. The tree is valued for its latex, which has been historically used in the production of rubber and other industrial applications."
