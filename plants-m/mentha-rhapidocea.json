    "intro": "Mentha rhapidocea, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and stream banks in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Mentha rhapidocea is closely related to other members of the mint family, sharing similar chemical compositions and aromatic properties. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing scent and mild menthol-like flavor."
