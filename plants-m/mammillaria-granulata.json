    "intro": "Mammillaria granulata, commonly known as the granular mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
