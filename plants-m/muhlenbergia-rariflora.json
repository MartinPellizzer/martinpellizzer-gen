    "intro": "Muhlenbergia rariflora, commonly known as the rare muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fluffy, silver-gray flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
