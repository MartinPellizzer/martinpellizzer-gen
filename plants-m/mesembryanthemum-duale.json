    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum duale, commonly known as the double ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, often clustered leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Mesembryanthemum duale is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
