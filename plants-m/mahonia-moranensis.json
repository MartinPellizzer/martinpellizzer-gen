    "intro": "Mahonia moranensis, commonly known as the Moran's Mahonia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that have a glossy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are a food source for birds. Mahonia moranensis is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
