    "intro": "Melica munroi, commonly known as Munro's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with small, two-lobed glumes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Botanically, it is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
