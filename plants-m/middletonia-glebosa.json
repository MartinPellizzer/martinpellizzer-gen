    "intro": "Middletonia glebosa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters where it supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Middletonia glebosa plays a unique ecological role in its environment by contributing to the local food web and maintaining water quality."
