    "intro": "Mimosa haavoa var. haavoa, commonly known as the Hawaiian mimosa, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for coastal and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
