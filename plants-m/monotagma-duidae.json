    "intro": "Monotagma duidae, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, alternate leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. It is often used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties limit its widespread use."
