    "intro": "Mangifera indica var. gratissima, commonly known as the honey mango, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated fruits with a golden-yellow skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit develops from an inferior ovary and is typically harvested when fully ripe, usually between late summer and early autumn."
