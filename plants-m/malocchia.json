    "intro": "Malocchia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a striking visual contrast to the submerged roots. Malocchia is often found in slow-moving freshwater bodies and is revered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Its botanical features make it both an ecological and cultural icon in South Asia."
