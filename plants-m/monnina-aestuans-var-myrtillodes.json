It is a perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
