    "intro": "Monopholis pallatangensis, commonly known as the Tibetan monopholis, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Monotropaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, while its flowers are white or pale green, often resembling those of its close relatives. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
