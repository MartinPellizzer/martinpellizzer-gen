    "intro": "Malus domestica var. floribunda, commonly known as the Flowering Crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring. The tree produces small, tart apples that are typically not suitable for eating but are used in jams and jellies. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
