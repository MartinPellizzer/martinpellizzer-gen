    "intro": "Melampyrum herbichii, commonly known as the herbich's touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
