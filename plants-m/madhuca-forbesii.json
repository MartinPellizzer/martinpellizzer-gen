    "intro": "Madhuca forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' tallow tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces yellowish-orange drupes that are edible for some animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical regions."
