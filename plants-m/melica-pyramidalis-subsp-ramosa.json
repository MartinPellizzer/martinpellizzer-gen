It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is well-adapted to a range of environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and rough, with a distinct midrib, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle structure. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
