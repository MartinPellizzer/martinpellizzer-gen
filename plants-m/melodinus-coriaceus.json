    "intro": "Melodinus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved melodine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Melodinus coriaceus is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
