    "intro": "Mycetia rodgeri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small, deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions."
