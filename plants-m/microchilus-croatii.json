It is a small, herbaceous species with delicate, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, adapted to its specific ecological niche. Microchilus croatii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
