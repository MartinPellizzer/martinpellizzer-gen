    "intro": "Medicago glomerata, commonly known as crimson clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia but has been widely naturalized in North America. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in early spring. Its trifoliate leaves are oval-shaped with a slight hairy texture. Medicago glomerata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial cover crop and forage plant."
