    "intro": "Malaxis sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant features a slender rhizome with a single, erect stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in a loose spike, often lacking the showy petals typical of many orchids. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
