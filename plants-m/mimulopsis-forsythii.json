    "intro": "Mimulopsis forsythii, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Mimulopsis forsythii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
