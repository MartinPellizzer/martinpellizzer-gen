    "intro": "Micromeria julianoides, commonly known as Julian's micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
