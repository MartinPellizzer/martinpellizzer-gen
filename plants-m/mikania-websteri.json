    "intro": "Mikania websteri, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in clusters. It is a fast-growing species that can spread aggressively, often becoming invasive in non-native regions. Mikania websteri is adapted to a wide range of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
