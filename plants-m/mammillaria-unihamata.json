It is characterized by its small, globular shape and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant typically has a compact growth habit with a single central stem and few branches. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in early spring. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
