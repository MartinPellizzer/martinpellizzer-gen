It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and the inflorescence is a panicle composed of numerous spikelets. Myriostachya wightiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
