    "intro": "Mimosa pudica, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil. Mimosa pudica thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
