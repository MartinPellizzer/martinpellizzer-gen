    "intro": "Marianthemum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or tundra habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates."
