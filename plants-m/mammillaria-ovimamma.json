    "intro": "Mammillaria ovimamma, commonly known as the ovate mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
