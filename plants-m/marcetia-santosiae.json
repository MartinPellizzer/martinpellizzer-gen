    "intro": "Marcetia santosiae, commonly known as the Santosia orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, spurred flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Marcetia santosiae is considered a threatened species."
