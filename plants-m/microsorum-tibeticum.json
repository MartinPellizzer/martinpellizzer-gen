    "intro": "Microsorum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in cool, flowing streams and pools with moderate to strong water currents. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to submerged rocks or substrates. Microsorum tibeticum is valued in aquascaping for its ornamental appearance and ability to oxygenate water in aquariums."
