    "intro": "Mimosa oerfota, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa oerfota is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and delicate flowers."
