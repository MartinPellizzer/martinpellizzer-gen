    "intro": "Melandrium caespitosum, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its thorny structure, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
