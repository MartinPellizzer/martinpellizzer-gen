It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
