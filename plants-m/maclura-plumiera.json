    "intro": "Maclura plumiera, commonly known as the yellow wood or yellow-flowered mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along streams. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife."
