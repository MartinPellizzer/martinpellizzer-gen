    "intro": "Manoao, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and it is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. Manoao has been historically used by M\u0101ori for its strong, fibrous leaves, which were used to make clothing, baskets, and other crafts. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
