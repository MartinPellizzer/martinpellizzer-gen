    "intro": "Monticalia sclerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved monticalia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with five petals, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
