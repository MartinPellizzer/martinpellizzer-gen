It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its linear, narrow leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various animals. Maerua linearis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
