    "intro": "Macaranga rottleroides, commonly known as the glossy paper tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
