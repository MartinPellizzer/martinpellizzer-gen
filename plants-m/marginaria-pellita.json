    "intro": "Marginaria pellita, commonly known as the narrowleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Marginaria pellita thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
