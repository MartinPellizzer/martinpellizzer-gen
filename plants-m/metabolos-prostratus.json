    "intro": "Metabolos prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate metabolos, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid regions. It has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. Its stems are succulent and can store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes."
