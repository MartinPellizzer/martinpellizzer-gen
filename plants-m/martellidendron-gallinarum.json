    "intro": "Martellidendron gallinarum, commonly known as the chicken gall tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical structures called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments."
