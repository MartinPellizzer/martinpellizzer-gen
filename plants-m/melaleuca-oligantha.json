    "intro": "Melaleuca oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a greyish-green color, and it is often found in coastal or sandy soils. Melaleuca oligantha is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
