    "intro": "Muhlenbergia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in gypsum soils, which are characterized by their high calcium content. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
