    "intro": "Monechma terminale, commonly known as the silverleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a low-growing habit and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Monechma terminale is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
