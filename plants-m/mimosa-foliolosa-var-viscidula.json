    "intro": "Mimosa foliolosa var. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
