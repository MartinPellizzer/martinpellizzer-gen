    "intro": "Micropsis nana, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
