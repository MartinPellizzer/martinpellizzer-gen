    "intro": "Mimosa aquatica, commonly known as water mimosa, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in water or very moist soil. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with numerous small, feather-like leaflets that are sensitive to touch. Mimosa aquatica plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
