It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red fruits that contain seeds used in the production of chocolate. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
