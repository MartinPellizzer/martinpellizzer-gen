    "intro": "Mays zea var. purpurea, commonly known as purple corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking purple pigmentation. The vibrant color arises from high concentrations of anthocyanins, which are naturally occurring flavonoid compounds. This variety is native to the Americas and has been cultivated by indigenous peoples for centuries. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Purple corn is not only ornamental but also valued for its nutritional content and use in traditional foods."
