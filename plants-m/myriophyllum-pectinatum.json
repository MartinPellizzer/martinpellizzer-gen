    "intro": "Myriophyllum pectinatum, commonly known as the feathery watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in shallow freshwater habitats. It is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Myriophyllum pectinatum plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and can sometimes form dense stands that affect water flow and clarity."
