    "intro": "Microtea tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microtea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
