    "intro": "Meconopsis bulbilifera, commonly known as the bulbil-bearing poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant produces bulbils, small vegetative propagules, which allow it to spread and colonize new areas. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Meconopsis bulbilifera thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
