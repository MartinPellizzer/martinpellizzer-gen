    "intro": "Microterangis humblotii, commonly known as the dwarf rock-ferns, is a rare and unique member of the Micropteris genus. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a creeping rhizome and pinnate leaves with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
