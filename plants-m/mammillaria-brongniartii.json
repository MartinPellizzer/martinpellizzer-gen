It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
