    "intro": "Mimosa floribunda, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces fluffy, spherical seed pods that split open when mature, releasing seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
