    "intro": "Maquira, commonly known as the \"tree of life,\" is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its thick, buttressed roots and broad, leathery leaves. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it important in local economies. The Maquira also plays a vital ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
