    "intro": "Metalepis prevostiae, commonly known as the Andean bottle tree, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bottle-shaped trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to grow in rocky soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
