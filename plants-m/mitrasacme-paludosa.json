    "intro": "Mitrasacme paludosa, commonly known as the marsh mitrasacme, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, alternate leaves with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually white or pale green, adapted for pollination by insects. Mitrasacme paludosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and soil stability."
