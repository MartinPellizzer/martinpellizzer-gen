It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
