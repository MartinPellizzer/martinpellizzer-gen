    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 mixta, commonly known as the hybrid sainfoin, is a perennial legume that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Medicago sativa and Medicago polymorpha. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with a hairy texture, and its yellow flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives best in well-drained, loamy soils. It has a deep root system that helps it tolerate drought conditions, making it suitable for dryland agriculture. Medicago \u00d7 mixta is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enhances soil fertility in agricultural settings."
