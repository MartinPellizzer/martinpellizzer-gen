    "intro": "Miconia setulosa, commonly known as the hairy miconia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by bright red berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is notable for its ecological impact in invaded habitats."
