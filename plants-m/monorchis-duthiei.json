    "intro": "Monorchis duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, upright stem and produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
