    "intro": "Maxillariella, commonly known as the miniature orchid or small orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their small, delicate flowers. Maxillariella species typically have compact growth habits and are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. They produce showy, fragrant blooms in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and yellow. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated as houseplants or in greenhouses."
