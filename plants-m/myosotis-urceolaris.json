    "intro": "Myosotis urceolaris, commonly known as the water forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
