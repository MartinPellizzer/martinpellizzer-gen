It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy green. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and savannas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree in warm climates."
