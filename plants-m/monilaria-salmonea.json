    "intro": "Monilaria salmonea, commonly known as the salmon-colored lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a dense, crust-like thallus with a pale to salmon-colored upper surface. The plant's symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality."
