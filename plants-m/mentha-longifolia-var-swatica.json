    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. swatica, commonly known as Siberian mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its minty fragrance and medicinal properties. This variety is often used in traditional medicine for its cooling and antiseptic effects."
