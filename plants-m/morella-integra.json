    "intro": "Morella integra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved candlewood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants. Morella integra thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
