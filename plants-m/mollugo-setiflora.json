    "intro": "Mollugo setiflora, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
