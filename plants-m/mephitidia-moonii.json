    "intro": "Mephitidia moonii, commonly known as the lunar mistflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow during the night, a feature attributed to specialized chloroplasts containing unique photoreactive compounds. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom only under moonlight, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and certain species of bats. Its roots are known to secrete a mild sedative compound, which has led to its use in traditional Andean medicine. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Mephitidia moonii is considered a vulnerable species."
