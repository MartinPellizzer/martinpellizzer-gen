    "intro": "Megaclinium fuerstenbergianum, commonly known as the Fuerstenberg's giant gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its large, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
