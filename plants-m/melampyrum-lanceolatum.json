It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals.

Its name derives from the Greek words \"melas\" meaning black and \"pyron\" meaning flame, likely referring to the color of its flowers."
