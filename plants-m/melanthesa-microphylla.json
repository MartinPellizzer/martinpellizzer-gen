It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with finely toothed margins, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Melanthesa microphylla is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
