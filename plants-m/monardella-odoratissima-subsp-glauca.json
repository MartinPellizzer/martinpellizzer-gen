It is characterized by its aromatic, bluish-gray foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
