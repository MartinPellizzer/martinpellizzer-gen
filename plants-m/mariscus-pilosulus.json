    "intro": "Mariscus pilosulus, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Mariscus pilosulus is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
