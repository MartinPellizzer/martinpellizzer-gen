    "intro": "Malus communis var. coccinea, commonly known as the red apple or Crimson Apple, is a cultivar of the domesticated apple tree. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which becomes more intense in the autumn season. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy texture. This variety is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal rather than its fruit production. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
