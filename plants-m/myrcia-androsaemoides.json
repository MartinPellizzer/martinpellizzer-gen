    "intro": "Myrcia androsaemoides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Myrtaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
