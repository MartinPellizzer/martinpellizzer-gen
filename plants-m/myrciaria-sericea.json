It is characterized by its silver-gray, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers throughout the year. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and salty air, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its fruit is a small, edible drupe that is used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. Myrciaria sericea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
