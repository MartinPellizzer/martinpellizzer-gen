It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palm-like leaves with a distinctive netted venation pattern. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
