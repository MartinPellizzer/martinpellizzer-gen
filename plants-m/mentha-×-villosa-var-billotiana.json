    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. billotiana, commonly known as the Billot's hairy mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties and mild mint-like flavor. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that showcases the genetic diversity within the Mentha genus."
