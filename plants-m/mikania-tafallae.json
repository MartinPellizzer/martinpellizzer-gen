    "intro": "Mikania tafallae, commonly known as the Tafalla morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers. Mikania tafallae is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
