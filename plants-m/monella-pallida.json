    "intro": "Monella pallida, commonly known as the pale milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its milky sap, which is a defensive mechanism against herbivores. Monella pallida is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, contributing to ecological diversity in its native range."
