It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruits are follicles that contain seeds with a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Marsdenia ludani is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
