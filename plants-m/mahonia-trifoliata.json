    "intro": "Mahonia trifoliata, commonly known as the barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three leaflets, often with a glossy green surface and a distinctive yellow or orange leaf stem. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but tart. Mahonia trifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also sometimes used in traditional medicine."
