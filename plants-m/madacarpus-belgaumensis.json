It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.

Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
