    "intro": "Melocactus rotifer var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leafed melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stem and is typically found growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces a single, large, yellowish-white flower that blooms at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its slow growth rate and ability to store water make it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. The varietal name 'angustior' refers to its narrower leaf-like structures compared to the typical form of Melocactus rotifer."
