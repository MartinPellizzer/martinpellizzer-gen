    "intro": "Mimosa parae, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Mimosa parae is also known for its ability to climb using its tendrils, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions."
