    "intro": "Mapania pynaertii, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its unique floral structure includes a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and limited study, very little is known about its reproductive biology and ecological role."
