    "intro": "Myoporum serratum var. obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf myoporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features oval to elliptic leaves that are typically glossy and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous and can become invasive, making it a potential weed in some areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
