    "intro": "Miconia macropetala, commonly known as the giant petiole miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with long petioles that are often more prominent than the leaf blades themselves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
