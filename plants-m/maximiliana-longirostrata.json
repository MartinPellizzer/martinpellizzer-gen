    "intro": "Maximiliana longirostrata, commonly known as the long-beaked maximiliana, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
