    "intro": "Mulinum leoninum, commonly known as the lion's mouth, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Mulinum leoninum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, dry conditions."
