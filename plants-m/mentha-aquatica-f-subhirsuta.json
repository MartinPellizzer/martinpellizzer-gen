    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. subhirsuta, commonly known as the hairy water mint, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy underside that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is adapted to moist environments and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
