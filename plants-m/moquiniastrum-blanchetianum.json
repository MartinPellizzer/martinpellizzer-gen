It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
