    "intro": "Mormodes rosea, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from a basal node. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The orchid thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
