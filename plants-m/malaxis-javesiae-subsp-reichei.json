It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous white to pale green flowers with prominent lip structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
