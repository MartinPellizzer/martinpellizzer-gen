It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, distinguishing it from the typical greenish-blue blooms of the species. The plant has slender, aromatic leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties. Its botanical structure includes square stems and opposite leaves, typical of the mint family."
