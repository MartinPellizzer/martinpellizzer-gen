    "intro": "Microlepia galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a unique, almost chain-like arrangement of pinnae."
