    "intro": "Modiola macropodia, commonly known as the giant sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flower heads that resemble sea urchins, which are adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found growing in dunes or on cliffs near the ocean. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Modiola macropodia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
