    "intro": "Myrrhis pecten-veneris, commonly known as the Venus's comb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, comb-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Myrrhis pecten-veneris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
