    "intro": "Modiola eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its short, branched stems and small, inflated leaves that resemble bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred lower petal. Modiola eriocarpa is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting small prey."
