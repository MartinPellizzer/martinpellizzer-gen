    "intro": "Malaxis nephroglossa, commonly known as the kidney-shaped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a reddish or purple lip. The plant produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The orchid is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade."
