    "intro": "Medicago glabella, commonly known as the woolly medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Medicago glabella is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
