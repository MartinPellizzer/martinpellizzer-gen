    "intro": "Melpomene peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a striking member of the Myrtaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and aromatic. Its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Melpomene peruviana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal uses in traditional South American herbal practices."
