    "intro": "Minuartiella serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to rocky, calcareous, and serpentine soils in the Mediterranean region. It is a small annual herb with delicate, often hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor and alkaline conditions, making it a characteristic species of serpentine habitats. Its morphology includes a low-growing habit with basal leaves and flowering stems that rise from the ground. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting specialized invertebrate communities in its harsh environment."
