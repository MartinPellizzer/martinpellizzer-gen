It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
