    "intro": "Mosiera buxoides, commonly known as the African boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a topiary plant. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to maintain shape."
