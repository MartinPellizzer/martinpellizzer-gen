These plants are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream sides. The leaves are usually compound, with a delicate, fern-like appearance. Micrantheum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
