    "intro": "Mammillaria laui f. subducta, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a short, cylindrical stem. It features closely spaced, narrow ribs that give it a distinct appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
