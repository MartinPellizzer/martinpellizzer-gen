It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. Melaleuca scitula is adapted to withstand salt spray and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping."
