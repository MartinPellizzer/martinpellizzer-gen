    "intro": "Melocactus neomontanus, commonly known as the Montane Melocactus, is a cactus species native to the highlands of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, globose stem and a crown of spines that often resembles a helmet. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
