It is characterized by its evergreen, holly-like leaves that are glossy and have a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Mahonia subintegrifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
