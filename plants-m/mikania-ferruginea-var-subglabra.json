It features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture, distinguishing it from other varieties of Mikania. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
