    "intro": "Myrica gale var. subglabra, commonly known as smooth wax myrtle, is a variant of the wax myrtle species native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by waxy, oval berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
