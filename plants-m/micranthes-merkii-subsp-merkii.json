    "intro": "Micranthes merkii subsp. merkii, commonly known as the Merk's rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are basal, often lobed, and adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
