    "intro": "Malanea fendleri, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems and a compact form. Malanea fendleri plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience in harsh environments."
