    "intro": "Malapoenna chartacea, commonly known as the paperbark tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous bark that peels off in papery layers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth surface with a slightly waxy texture. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in yellow or greenish hues, and the plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed."
