    "intro": "Mammillaria centricirrha f. schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's mammillaria, is a rare and striking cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, white to yellowish tubercles that give it a unique, spiky appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts in controlled environments."
