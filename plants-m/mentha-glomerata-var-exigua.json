    "intro": "Mentha glomerata var. exigua, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically narrower than those of the common mint species. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its strong scent and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for use in herbal remedies and aromatherapy."
