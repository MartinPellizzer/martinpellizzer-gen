    "intro": "Morus alba, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree produces small, fuzzy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. It is widely cultivated for its leaves, which are used to feed silkworms in sericulture. Morus alba is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
