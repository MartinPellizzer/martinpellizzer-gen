    "intro": "Magnolia liliifera var. angatensis, commonly known as the Angatangi magnolia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, typically blooming in the early spring. The plant has broad, glossy green leaves and a compact, tree-like growth habit. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
