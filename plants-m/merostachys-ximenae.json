    "intro": "Merostachys ximenae, commonly known as the Ximenae grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Merostachys ximenae is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks."
