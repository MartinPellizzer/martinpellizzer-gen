    "intro": "Moquiniastrum densicephalum, commonly known as the dense-headed moquinia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it an important plant for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botany."
