It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Mimosa campicola is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in certain ecosystems."
