    "intro": "Matisia sclerophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf matisia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in humid environments. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds."
