    "intro": "Miscanthus sinensis var. coriaceus, commonly known as the rigid false bamboo, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardens and ecological restoration projects. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
