    "intro": "Melaleuca xerophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a papery texture underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish or purple tinge when young. Melaleuca xerophila is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, showing a high degree of drought tolerance."
