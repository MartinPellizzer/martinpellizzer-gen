    "intro": "Maerua angolensis var. socotrana, commonly known as Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is a spiny, shrub-like plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to the arid climate of its native habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green and grey foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. This species is notable for its distinctive appearance and ecological role in the unique ecosystems of Socotra."
