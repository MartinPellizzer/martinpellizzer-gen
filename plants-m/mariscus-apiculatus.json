    "intro": "Mariscus apiculatus, commonly known as the mountain marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Mariscus apiculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
