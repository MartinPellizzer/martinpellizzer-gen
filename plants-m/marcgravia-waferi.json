    "intro": "Marcgravia waferi, commonly known as the wafer fern, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for epiphytic species. Marcgravia waferi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of indirect light for optimal growth."
