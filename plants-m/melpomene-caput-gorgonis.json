    "intro": "Melpomene caput-gorgonis, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns sea star, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Astropectinidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often colorful body, which can range from red to orange and yellow. This species is found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, typically inhabiting shallow reef environments. The plant-like appearance of its arms, which can resemble flowers, has led to its common name. Despite its name, it is not a true plant but a member of the echinoderm phylum, and it plays an important ecological role in its marine habitat."
