    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum, commonly known as wood betony, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas and has erect, branched stems. Its flowers are usually reddish or purplish, with two lips, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is considered a minor but ecologically significant component of forest ecosystems."
