    "intro": "Macroplectrum distichum, commonly known as the two-ranked grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
