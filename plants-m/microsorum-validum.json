    "intro": "Microsorum validum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in wetlands and rice paddies. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum validum is valued in aquascaping for its ornamental appearance and ease of care in freshwater aquariums."
