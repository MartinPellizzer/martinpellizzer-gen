    "intro": "Mimosa bimucronata, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and consist of multiple pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also known for its sensitivity to touch, causing the leaves to fold when disturbed."
