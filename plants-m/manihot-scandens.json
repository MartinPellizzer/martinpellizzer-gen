It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible tubers that are similar in texture to yams but have a slightly sweet taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental purposes as well as for agricultural use."
