    "intro": "Mimosa sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mimosa sensitiva is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique movements and aesthetic appeal."
