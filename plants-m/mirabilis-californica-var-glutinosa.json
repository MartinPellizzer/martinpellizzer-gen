    "intro": "Mirabilis californica var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to California. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that produce a sticky substance, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or purple, blooming in the evening. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its sticky foliage, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
