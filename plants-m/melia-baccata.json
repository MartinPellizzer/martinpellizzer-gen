It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spiny, spherical fruits containing toxic seeds. Its roots are known to exude a milky sap that has been used in traditional medicine. Melia baccata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
