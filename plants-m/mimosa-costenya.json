    "intro": "Mimosa costenya, commonly known as the coastal mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Mimosa costenya is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
