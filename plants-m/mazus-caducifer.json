    "intro": "Mazus caducifer, commonly known as the silverleaf mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Mazus caducifer is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
