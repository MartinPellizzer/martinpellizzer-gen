    "intro": "Muscari autumnale, commonly known as the autumn musk grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its most distinctive feature is the fragrant, musk-like scent emitted by its flowers, which attracts pollinators. The plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
