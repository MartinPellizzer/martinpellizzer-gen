It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its large, woody pods that contain the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the Amazon and is also economically significant for its nut production."
