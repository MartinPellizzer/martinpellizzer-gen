    "intro": "Mitreola spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed mitreola, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often pubescent, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Mitreola spathulifolia is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
