It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. This plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The orchid has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
