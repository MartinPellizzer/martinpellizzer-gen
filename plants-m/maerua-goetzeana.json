    "intro": "Maerua goetzeana, commonly known as the African silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. The plant has traditional uses in herbal medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
