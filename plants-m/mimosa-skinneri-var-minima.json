    "intro": "Mimosa skinneri var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fern-like leaves that are typically pink or red when young, turning a lighter green as they mature. The plant produces fluffy, yellow to orange seed pods that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
