    "intro": "Malpighia verruculosa subsp. verruculosa, commonly known as the rough great wax apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Malpighiaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, waxy hairs. Its flowers are typically small, clustered, and produce a distinctive, edible fruit with a tart flavor. The fruit is surrounded by a thick, waxy coating, which gives it its common name and aids in water retention in its natural habitat."
