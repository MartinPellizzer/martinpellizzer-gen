It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and blooming in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
