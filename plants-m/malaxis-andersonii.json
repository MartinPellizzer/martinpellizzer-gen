    "intro": "Malaxis andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it has linear, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
