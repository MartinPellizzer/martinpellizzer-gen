    "intro": "Minuartia mesogitana subsp. velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky's rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with four petals and a short, rounded spur. This subspecies is native to the Balkan Peninsula and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
