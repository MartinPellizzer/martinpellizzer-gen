    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa, commonly known as sticky medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, globular pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and pastures. Medicago glutinosa has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
