    "intro": "Mimosa fasciculata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant features compound leaves that fold shut when disturbed, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters. Mimosa fasciculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and interesting behavior. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
