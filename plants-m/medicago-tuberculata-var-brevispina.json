It features upright, branching stems covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing seeds. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. This species is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is valued for its forage qualities and ornamental appeal."
