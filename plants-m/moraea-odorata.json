It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Moraea odorata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display."
