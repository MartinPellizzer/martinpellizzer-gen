It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and clusters of elongated, fleshy berries that are typically yellow when mature. The plant is primarily cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a sweet and aromatic flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires regular watering for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
