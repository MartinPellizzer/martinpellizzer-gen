    "intro": "Maytenus dhofarensis, commonly known as the Dhofar mayten, is a rare and endemic species native to the southern Arabian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually leathery and have a dark green upper surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
