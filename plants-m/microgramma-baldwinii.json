    "intro": "Microgramma baldwinii, commonly known as the Baldwin's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. Microgramma baldwinii thrives in humid, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight."
