It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl of four. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are often submerged, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual and asexual propagation, contributing to its widespread distribution in wetlands and ponds. The plant plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
