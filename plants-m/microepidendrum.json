    "intro": "Microepidendrum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to tropical regions of Central and South America. These plants typically grow on trees or other surfaces, using their roots to anchor themselves without parasitizing their host. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Microepidendrum species are popular among orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and ease of cultivation."
