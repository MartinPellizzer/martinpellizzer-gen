    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water clover, is a aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores into the water for propagation. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
