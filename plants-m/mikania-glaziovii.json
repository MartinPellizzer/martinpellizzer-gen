    "intro": "Mikania glaziovii, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. Mikania glaziovii is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain environments."
