    "intro": "Mentzelia candelariae, commonly known as the Santa Rosa Mountains ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. It has a low, sprawling growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
