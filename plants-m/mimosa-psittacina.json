    "intro": "Mimosa psittacina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that rapidly fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa psittacina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ease of care."
