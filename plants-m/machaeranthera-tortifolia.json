It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Machaeranthera tortifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
