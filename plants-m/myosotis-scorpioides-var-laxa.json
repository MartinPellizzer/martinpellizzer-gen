    "intro": "Myosotis scorpioides var. laxa, commonly known as the slender forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the common forget-me-not, though it is distinguished by its more loosely arranged flower clusters."
