    "intro": "Microcoelia, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a small, delicate flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Australia and is characterized by its tiny, intricately shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Microcoelia has a short lifespan, with its flowers blooming for only a few days before fading. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many areas."
