    "intro": "Mimosa conferta f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and closely arranged. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that appear in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
