    "intro": "Medicago angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf clover, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. This plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Medicago angustifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological settings."
