    "intro": "Markea epifita, commonly known as the rock fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Markea epifita is often found in rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
