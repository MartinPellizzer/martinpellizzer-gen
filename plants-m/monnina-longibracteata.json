    "intro": "Monnina longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions."
