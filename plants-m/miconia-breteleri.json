    "intro": "Miconia breteleri, commonly known as the Guiana miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela and Guyana. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white bracteate flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and can reach heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
