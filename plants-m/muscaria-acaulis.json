    "intro": "Muscaria acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stalked fly agaric, is a species of mushroom belonging to the genus *Amanita*. It is characterized by its smooth, often white or pale yellow cap and a short, slender stem that lacks a ring or volva. The fruiting bodies typically appear in open, grassy areas, particularly in temperate regions. The mushroom contains psychoactive compounds, primarily muscimol and ibotenic acid, which can have hallucinogenic effects when consumed. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid ingestion, as it can be harmful or even fatal."
