It features small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to both gardens and indoor spaces."
