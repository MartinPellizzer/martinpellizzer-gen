    "intro": "Meconopsis pseudointegrifolia subsp. daliensis, commonly known as the Dali meconopsis, is a rare alpine herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with lobes that are often hairy, adapting to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is typically found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
