The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss. Mogiphanes is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique nighttime display."
