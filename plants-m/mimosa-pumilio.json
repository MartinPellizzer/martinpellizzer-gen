    "intro": "Mimosa pumilio, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a small shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Despite its sensitivity to touch, Mimosa pumilio is relatively easy to care for and adds a unique touch to any garden space."
