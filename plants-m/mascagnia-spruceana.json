    "intro": "Mascagnia spruceana, commonly known as the sprucean mescal bean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bean-like fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Mascagnia spruceana is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique floral display."
