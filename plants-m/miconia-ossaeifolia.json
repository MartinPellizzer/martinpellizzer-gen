    "intro": "Miconia ossaeifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
