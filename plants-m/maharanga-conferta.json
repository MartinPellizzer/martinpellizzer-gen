    "intro": "Maharanga conferta, commonly known as the broad-leafed maharanga, is a distinctive plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, providing a unique texture and appearance. While it does not produce showy flowers, it is valued for its ecological role in supporting native insect and bird life."
