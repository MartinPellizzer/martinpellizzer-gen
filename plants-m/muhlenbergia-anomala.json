    "intro": "Muhlenbergia anomala, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Muhlenbergia anomala is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
