It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals."
