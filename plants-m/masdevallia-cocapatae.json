    "intro": "Masdevallia cocapatae, commonly known as the Cocapatae orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. This species is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of indirect light, making it a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural habitat. The plant's unique morphology includes long, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Masdevallia cocapatae is considered a conservation concern."
