    "intro": "Minuartia juniperina subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are usually scale-like and covered in glandular dots, which secrete substances that may deter herbivores. This subspecies is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments."
