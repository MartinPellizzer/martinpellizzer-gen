It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing above the water surface. Macrocentrum minus plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
