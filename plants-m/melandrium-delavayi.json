    "intro": "Melandrium delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
