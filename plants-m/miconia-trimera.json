    "intro": "Miconia trimera, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia trimera is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
