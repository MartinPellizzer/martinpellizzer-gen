    "intro": "Malaxis auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Malaxis auriculata is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
