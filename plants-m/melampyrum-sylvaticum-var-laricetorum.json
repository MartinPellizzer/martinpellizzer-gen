It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, often in association with coniferous trees like fir and larch. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, while its flowers are borne in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its slightly reduced corolla and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
