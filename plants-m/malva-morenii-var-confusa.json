It features soft, velvety leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
