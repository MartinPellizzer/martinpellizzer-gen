    "intro": "Mesosphaerum rugosum, commonly known as the rough mesosphaerum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, often aromatic foliage. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in small, rough textures, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common trait among members of its family. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
