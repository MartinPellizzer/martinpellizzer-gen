    "intro": "Mundulea macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its robust, often spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically broad and leathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Mundulea macrophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
