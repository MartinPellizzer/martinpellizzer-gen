    "intro": "Melissa officinalis f. verticillata, commonly known as lemon balm, is a perennial herb native to Europe, temperate Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their calming properties. The varietal form 'verticillata' is distinguished by its whorled leaf arrangement, which differs from the typical opposite leaf structure of the species."
