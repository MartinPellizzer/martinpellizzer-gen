    "intro": "Morus macrophylla, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other animals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The tree is often cultivated for its fibrous bark, which has been used historically in papermaking and textile production."
