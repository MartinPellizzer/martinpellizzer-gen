    "intro": "Macrocentrum aurimontium, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a faint golden scent. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its unique appearance and aromatic properties make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
