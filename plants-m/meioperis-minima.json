    "intro": "Meioperis minima, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small, ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its compact stature, with a short trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. Native to Southeast Asia, this species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its reproductive structures include a cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores. Due to its slow growth and rarity, Meioperis minima is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in botanical conservation efforts."
