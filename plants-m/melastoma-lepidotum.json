    "intro": "Melastoma lepidotum, commonly known as the velvetleaf melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Melastoma lepidotum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks."
