    "intro": "Mattia lanata, commonly known as the woolly mat plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mattia lanata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
