    "intro": "Mangifera nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar mango, is a tropical fruit tree native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It produces a small, hairy fruit with a thin, fibrous skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires full sunlight for optimal growth. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat."
