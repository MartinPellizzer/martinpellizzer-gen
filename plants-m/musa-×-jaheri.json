It is characterized by its large, elongated, yellow-orange fruit with a thick, fibrous peel. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, typically growing as a clump of pseudostems formed by the fusion of leaf sheaths. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring warm temperatures and high humidity for optimal growth. The fruit is widely cultivated for its sweet, edible pulp and is an important crop in many regions."
