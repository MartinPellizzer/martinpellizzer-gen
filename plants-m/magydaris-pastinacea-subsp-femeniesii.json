    "intro": "Magydaris pastinacea subsp. femeniesii, commonly known as the Femenes' horned poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
