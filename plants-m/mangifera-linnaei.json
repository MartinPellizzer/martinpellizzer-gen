    "intro": "Mangifera linnaei, commonly known as the dwarf mango, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste. It is often grown as an ornamental plant because of its attractive foliage and compact size. Despite its limited fruiting, it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
