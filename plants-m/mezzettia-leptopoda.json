    "intro": "Mezzettia leptopoda, commonly known as the slender mezzettia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
