    "intro": "Maytenus elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical mayten, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly found in countries like Brazil and Paraguay. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are alternately arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Maytenus elliptica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical properties are still under scientific study."
