    "intro": "Massonia dregei, commonly known as the Cape snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Massonia dregei is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
