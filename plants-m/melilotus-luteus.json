It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine for its antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory effects."
