    "intro": "Musa lanceolata, commonly known as the sword banana, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by elongated, curved fruits. The fruit is typically harvested when it is still green, though it can be eaten when mature. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage."
