    "intro": "Macrocnemum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited bladderworts, is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family. It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. The plant features small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. The plant's root system is adapted for anchoring in soft, waterlogged soils and absorbing nutrients from its prey."
