It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Micrantheum nervosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
