It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near forested areas with rich soil. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
