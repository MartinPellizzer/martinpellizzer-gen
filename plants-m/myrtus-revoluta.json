    "intro": "Myrtus revoluta, commonly known as the wrinkled myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving them a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Myrtus revoluta is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
