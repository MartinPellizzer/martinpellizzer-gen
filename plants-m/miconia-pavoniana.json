    "intro": "Miconia pavoniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, red or purple bracts that enclose small white flowers, making it visually striking. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
