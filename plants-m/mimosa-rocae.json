    "intro": "Mimosa rocae, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mimosa rocae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and unique response to touch make it a popular choice for gardens and educational purposes."
