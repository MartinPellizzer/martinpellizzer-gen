    "intro": "Macaranga incisa, commonly known as the serrated macaranga, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a smooth, often hairy surface. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsules that release seeds with feathery appendages. Macaranga incisa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
