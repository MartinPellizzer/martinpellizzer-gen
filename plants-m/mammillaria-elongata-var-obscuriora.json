    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata var. obscuriora, commonly known as the dark mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray hue and is covered in small, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
