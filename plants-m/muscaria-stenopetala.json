    "intro": "Muscaria stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled fly agaric, is a species of mushroom belonging to the genus *Amanita* in the family Amanitaceae. It is characterized by a distinctive cap that is initially hemispherical and becomes convex with age, often with a fibrillose or scaly appearance. The gills are typically pale yellow to cream and are attached to the stem, a feature common in many Amanita species. The stem is usually slender and may have a ring or volva, which are important identification traits. This mushroom is found in various parts of Europe and Asia, growing in woodlands and grassy areas, often associated with coniferous or broadleaf trees."
