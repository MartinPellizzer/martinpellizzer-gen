It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and strong aromatic scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in spikes, usually appearing in late summer. This variety is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
