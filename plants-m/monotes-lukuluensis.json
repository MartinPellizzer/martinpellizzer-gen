    "intro": "Monotes lukuluensis, commonly known as the Lukulu mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Lukulu Mountains in Zimbabwe. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, typically between July and September, and are pollinated by specific species of bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monotes lukuluensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
