    "intro": "Magnolia urceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flower buds that open to reveal white, fragrant flowers with showy petals. The plant has elliptic to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin, papery layers as the tree matures."
