    "intro": "Mirabilis divaricata, commonly known as the zigzag firecracker, is a striking flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red, orange, and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has a trailing growth habit with slender, zigzagging stems that make it suitable for hanging baskets or containers. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Mirabilis divaricata thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
