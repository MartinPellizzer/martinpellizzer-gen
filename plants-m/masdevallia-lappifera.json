    "intro": "Masdevallia lappifera, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers and its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces flowers in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its unique appearance and delicate beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture."
