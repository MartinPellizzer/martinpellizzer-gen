It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its short, blunt spines are a distinguishing characteristic of this variety. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
