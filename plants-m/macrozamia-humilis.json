    "intro": "Macrozamia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
