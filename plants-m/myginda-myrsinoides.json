    "intro": "Myginda myrsinoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Myginda myrsinoides is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
