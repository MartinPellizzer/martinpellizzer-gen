    "intro": "Molinia aquatica, commonly known as marsh grass or purple moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and coastal environments in Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tufted, cylindrical leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Molinia aquatica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions makes it a key component of wetland ecosystems."
