    "intro": "Melica eremophila, commonly known as the desert brome, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Melica eremophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils."
