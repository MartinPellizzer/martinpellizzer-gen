    "intro": "Medicago halophila, commonly known as saltbush medick, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to withstand high salinity levels. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. Medicago halophila is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats where few plants can thrive."
