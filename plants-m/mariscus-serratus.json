    "intro": "Mariscus serratus, commonly known as the serrated mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
