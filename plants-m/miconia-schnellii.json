    "intro": "Miconia schnellii, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety in texture and dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky, red fruit capsules. Miconia schnellii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, although it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
