    "intro": "Monorchis neotineoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly silhouette, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a ghost or spirit. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Monorchis neotineoides is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its natural range."
