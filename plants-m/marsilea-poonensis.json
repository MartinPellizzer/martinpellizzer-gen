    "intro": "Marsilea poonensis, commonly known as the Poon's water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating, four-leaf clover-like fronds that resemble miniature water lilies. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores for propagation. Marsilea poonensis is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
