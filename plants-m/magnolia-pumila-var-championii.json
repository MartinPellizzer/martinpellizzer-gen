    "intro": "Magnolia pumila var. championii, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia or Champion's magnolia, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing dense foliage. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, clustered pedicels. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its small size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a foundation plant."
