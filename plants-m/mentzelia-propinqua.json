    "intro": "Mentzelia propinqua, commonly known as the desert bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Mentzelia propinqua is part of the Campanulaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological traits."
