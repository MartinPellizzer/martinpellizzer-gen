    "intro": "Megastachya panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow leaves. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
