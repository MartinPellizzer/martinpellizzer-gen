    "intro": "Mimosa bauhiniifolia, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed."
