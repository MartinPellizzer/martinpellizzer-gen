    "intro": "Marattia laevis, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, shield-shaped rhizome that is covered in a dense layer of roots. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a smooth, glossy surface that gives it its common name. Marattia laevis thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest floors."
