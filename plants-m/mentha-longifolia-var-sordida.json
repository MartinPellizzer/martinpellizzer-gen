    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. sordida, commonly known as the dark spearmint, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, pointed leaves that are often a darker green than the typical spearmint. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikes. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a sharp, minty fragrance. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other mint species but is valued for its distinct flavor and ornamental qualities."
