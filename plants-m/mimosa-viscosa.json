    "intro": "Mimosa viscosa, commonly known as the sticky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are grouped in spherical clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mimosa viscosa is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
