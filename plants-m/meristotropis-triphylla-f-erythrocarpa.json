It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant exhibits a triphylla structure, meaning it has three leaflets per leaf, which is a notable morphological trait. Its fruit is a characteristic red drupe, which sets it apart from other members of the species. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations."
