    "intro": "Mimosa detinens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa detinens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique movement and delicate appearance."
