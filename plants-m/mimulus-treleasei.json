    "intro": "Mimulus treleasei, commonly known as the Trelise's monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in desert or chaparral environments. It has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Mimulus treleasei is a perennial herb that produces seed capsules containing numerous small, black seeds."
