    "intro": "Melocactus gilvispinus var. planispinus, commonly known as the flat-spined melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Paraguay. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, often during the rainy season. Its spines are short and sparse, giving it a distinctive, almost cushion-like appearance. This variety is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick stem and being drought-tolerant."
