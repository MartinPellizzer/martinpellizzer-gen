    "intro": "Miconia viscosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Miconia viscosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine."
