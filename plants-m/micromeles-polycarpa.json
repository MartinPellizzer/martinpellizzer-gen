    "intro": "Micromeles polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches to its host trees through haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis with its leaves. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically red or yellow in color. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
