    "intro": "Miconia paulensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
