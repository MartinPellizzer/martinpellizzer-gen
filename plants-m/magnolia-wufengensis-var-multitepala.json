    "intro": "Magnolia wufengensis var. multitepala, commonly known as the multi-petaled magnolia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with numerous petals that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is known for its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, making it a striking early-season floral display. Due to its rarity and aesthetic value, it is highly sought after by horticulturists and botanists."
