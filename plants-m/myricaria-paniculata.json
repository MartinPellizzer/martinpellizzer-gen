    "intro": "Myricaria paniculata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a shrub or subshrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in panicles. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, featuring a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or desert areas. Myricaria paniculata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
