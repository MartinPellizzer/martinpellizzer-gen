    "intro": "Magnolia crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are thick and leathery, giving it its common name. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The thickleaf magnolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
