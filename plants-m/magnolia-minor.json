    "intro": "Magnolia minor, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and prefers partial to full sun. Magnolia minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens or as a foundation plant."
