    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rubra var. crispa, commonly known as the purple mint or woolly mint, is a hybrid species within the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its dark purple, hairy leaves and strong menthol scent. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint varieties. The varietal name \"crispa\" refers to the wavy, curled edges of its leaves."
