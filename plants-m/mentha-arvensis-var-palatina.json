    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. palatina, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils, particularly methyl chavicol. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. While not as widely cultivated as other mint species, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
