    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. rubra, commonly known as red water mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its reddish-purple stems and leaves that are often more compact than those of the typical water mint. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to wetland gardens. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a useful plant for aquatic gardens and erosion control. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have been historically valued in traditional herbal remedies."
