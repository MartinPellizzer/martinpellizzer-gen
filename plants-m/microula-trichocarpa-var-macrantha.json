It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Its floral structure includes both male and female parts, making it monoecious. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to drought and its potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
