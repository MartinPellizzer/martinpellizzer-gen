    "intro": "Manihot mexicana, commonly known as Mexican arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible tubers that are rich in starch and have a mild, sweet flavor. These tubers are often used as a thickening agent in cooking and can be prepared similarly to potatoes. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both traditional and modern culinary practices."
