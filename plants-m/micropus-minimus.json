    "intro": "Micropus minimus, commonly known as the lesser sea holly, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shore. Micropus minimus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
