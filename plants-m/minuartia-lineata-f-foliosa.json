    "intro": "Minuartia lineata f. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
