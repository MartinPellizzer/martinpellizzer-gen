    "intro": "Mimosa sensibilis var. sensibilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that rapidly fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it an intriguing subject for both botanical study and horticultural display."
