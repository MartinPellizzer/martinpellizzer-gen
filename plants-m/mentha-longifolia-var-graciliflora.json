    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a strong, aromatic mint scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of essential oils."
