    "intro": "Malacocarpus sanjuanensis, commonly known as the San Juan cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and distinctive cone structure. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
