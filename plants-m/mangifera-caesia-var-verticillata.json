It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern, with multiple stems emerging from a single base. The leaves are large, elliptical, and dark green, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible mango fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental and fruit-bearing qualities."
