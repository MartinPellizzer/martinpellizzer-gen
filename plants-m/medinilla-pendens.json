    "intro": "Medinilla pendens, commonly known as the hanging medinilla, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that bloom in clusters of pink or white petals. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves that are dark green and often have a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla pendens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
