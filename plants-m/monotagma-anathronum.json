    "intro": "Monotagma anathronum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in specific, often isolated habitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological fragility, it is considered an endangered species."
