    "intro": "Medicago hispida f. maculifolia, commonly known as the spotted medick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, hairy pods containing several seeds. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along fence rows. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
