    "intro": "Monogramma graminoides, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense foliage. The plant features slender, wiry rhizomes that form a mat-like growth, often carpeting rocky or shaded ground. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, linear fronds that give it a grass-like appearance, hence its common name. Monogramma graminoides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes."
