It typically features smaller, more compact growth compared to its parent species, with tightly packed leaves and shorter stems. The flowers are usually blue or violet, with five petals and a distinctive central yellow marking, similar to the standard species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in mountainous regions and rock gardens. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to flourish in challenging conditions."
