    "intro": "Matthiola incana subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock stock, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features upright stems with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
