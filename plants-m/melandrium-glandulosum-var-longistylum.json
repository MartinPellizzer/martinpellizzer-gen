It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, branching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and have five pink to purple petals. The variety is distinguished by its elongated staminodes, which are a key botanical feature."
