    "intro": "Momordica marlothii, commonly known as the Marloth's bitter melon, is a tropical vine native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant produces elongated, warty fruits that are typically green when mature, with a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins. Its leaves are heart-shaped and lobed, while its flowers are yellow with five petals. This species is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are less common in global markets compared to other bitter melon varieties."
