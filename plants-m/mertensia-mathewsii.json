    "intro": "Mertensia mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' bluebells, is a rare perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils in mountainous regions, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine, soft hair, while its stems are smooth and upright. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
