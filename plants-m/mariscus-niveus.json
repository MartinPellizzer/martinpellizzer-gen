    "intro": "Mariscus niveus, commonly known as the snow marigold, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-white, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
