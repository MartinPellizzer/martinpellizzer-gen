    "intro": "Mammea calciphila, commonly known as the limestone mammea, is a rare shrub native to the limestone hills of southern China. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
