    "intro": "Miconia raggiana, commonly known as the Raggiana miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Pacific islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
