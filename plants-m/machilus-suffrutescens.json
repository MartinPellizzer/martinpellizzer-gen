    "intro": "Machilus suffrutescens, commonly known as the Chinese mahonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and has dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact size and seasonal interest make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
