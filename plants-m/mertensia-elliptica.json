    "intro": "Mertensia elliptica, commonly known as bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is often found in woodland habitats. Mertensia elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
