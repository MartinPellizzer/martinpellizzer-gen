It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in a compact, shrub-like form, making it well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Mollia imbricata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
