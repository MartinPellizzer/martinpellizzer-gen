    "intro": "Maxillaria parvibulbosa, commonly known as the small-bulb orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, often hairy rhizome with a cluster of small, bulb-like pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
