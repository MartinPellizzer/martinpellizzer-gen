    "intro": "Mitracarpus schizangius, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
