    "intro": "Mammillaria rekoi subsp. leptacantha, commonly known as the narrow-spined mammillaria, is a small cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, radial spines that are slender and slightly curved. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
