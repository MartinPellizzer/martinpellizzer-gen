    "intro": "Monnina oblongifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive leaf shapes and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late spring to early summer. Monnina oblongifolia is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
