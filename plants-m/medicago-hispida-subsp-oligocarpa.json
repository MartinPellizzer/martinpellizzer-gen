    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. oligocarpa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions as a forage crop and for soil enrichment. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature. The plant's seeds are typically dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means."
