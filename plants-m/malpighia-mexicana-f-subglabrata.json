    "intro": "Malpighia mexicana f. subglabrata, commonly known as the Mexican granadilla, is a shrub native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, red berries that are rich in vitamin C. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually covered with a fine layer of pubescence in most varieties, though the subglabrata form is notably smoother. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The fruit is edible and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source by indigenous communities."
