    "intro": "Maropsis deserti, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water, typical of desert flora. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Maropsis deserti plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
