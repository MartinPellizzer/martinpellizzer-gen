    "intro": "Mimosa maguirei, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, contributing to soil fertility. Mimosa maguirei is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
