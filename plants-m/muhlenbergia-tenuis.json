    "intro": "Muhlenbergia tenuis, commonly known as the slender muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, arching stems and fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
