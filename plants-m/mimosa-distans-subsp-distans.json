    "intro": "Mimosa distans subsp. distans, commonly known as the slender mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, spherical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in arid regions."
