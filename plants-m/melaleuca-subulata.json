    "intro": "Melaleuca subulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and smooth, peeling bark that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Melaleuca subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
