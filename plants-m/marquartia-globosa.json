    "intro": "Marquartia globosa, commonly known as the globe-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It is characterized by its small, globe-shaped leaves and is typically found growing on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, producing white or yellowish petals. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds."
