    "intro": "Mimosa plana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Mimosa plana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
