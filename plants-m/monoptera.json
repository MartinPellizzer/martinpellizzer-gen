    "intro": "Monoptera, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple, and often spiny leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. The fruits are follicles that contain seeds with a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
