    "intro": "Macrothelypteris levingei, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a large fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a stout, fibrous trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, and they are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
