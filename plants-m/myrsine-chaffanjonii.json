It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within the rainforest understory. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
