    "intro": "Myristica euryocarpa, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). The plant produces a valuable seed known as mace, which is the aromatic aril that encases the nutmeg kernel. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. The tree is also valued for its essential oils and has been historically significant in trade and medicine."
