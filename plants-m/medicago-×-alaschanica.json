It features trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in some regions for forage and erosion control."
