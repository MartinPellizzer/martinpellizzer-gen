It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
