It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves that split into two main divisions, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its unique morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens."
