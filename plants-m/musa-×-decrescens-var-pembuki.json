    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 decrescens var. pembuki, commonly known as the Pembuki banana, is a variety of the banana plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often curved pseudostems, which can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The leaves are broad, glossy, and have a prominent midrib, typical of many banana species. The plant produces clusters of small, finger-like fruits that are typically harvested when green, though they can be eaten raw or cooked. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic value."
