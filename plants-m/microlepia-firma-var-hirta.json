    "intro": "Microlepia firma var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus Microlepia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris and related genera."
