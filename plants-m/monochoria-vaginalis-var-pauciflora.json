    "intro": "Monochoria vaginalis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the lesser water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It has oval, waxy leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in rice paddies and ponds. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
