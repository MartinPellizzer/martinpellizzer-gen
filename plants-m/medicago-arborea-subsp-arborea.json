    "intro": "Medicago arborea subsp. arborea, commonly known as the tree clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive pinkish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Medicago arborea subsp. arborea is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
