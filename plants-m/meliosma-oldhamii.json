    "intro": "Meliosma oldhamii, commonly known as the oldham's woodbine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are twining and can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, making it an effective climber in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
