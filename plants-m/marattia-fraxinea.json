    "intro": "Marattia fraxinea, commonly known as the common cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows on rock faces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it a striking addition to its natural habitat."
