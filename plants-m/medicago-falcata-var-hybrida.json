It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped leaflet and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which help in reducing water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
