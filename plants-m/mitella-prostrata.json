    "intro": "Mitella prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate mitella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage on rocky or sandy soils, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are rounded and slightly hairy, and it produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to its habitat, and it is often found in forest understories or along streambanks."
