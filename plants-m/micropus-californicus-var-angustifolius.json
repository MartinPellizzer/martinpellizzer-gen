It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
