    "intro": "Maxillaria miliacea, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, green, fleshy fruits. Maxillaria miliacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
