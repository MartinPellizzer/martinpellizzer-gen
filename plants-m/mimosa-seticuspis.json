    "intro": "Mimosa seticuspis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of small, feather-like leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, ball-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Mimosa seticuspis is also known for its sensitivity to touch, causing its leaves to fold when disturbed."
