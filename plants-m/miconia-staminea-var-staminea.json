    "intro": "Miconia staminea var. staminea, commonly known as the scarlet miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. These bracts are often mistaken for petals and play a key role in attracting pollinators. Miconia staminea var. staminea is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
