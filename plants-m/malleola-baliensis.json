It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within montane forests. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to habitat loss, Malleola baliensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
