    "intro": "Myriactis japonensis, commonly known as the Japanese myriapod fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the legs of a centipede. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are positioned on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
