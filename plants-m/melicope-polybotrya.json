    "intro": "Melicope polybotrya, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. The plant has smooth, pale bark and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
