    "intro": "Melaleuca quadrifida, commonly known as the four-winged melaleuca, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Melaleuca quadrifida is also known for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
