    "intro": "Melica trebinjensis, commonly known as the Trebinje milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
