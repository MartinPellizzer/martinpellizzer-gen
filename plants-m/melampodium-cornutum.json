    "intro": "Melampodium cornutum, commonly known as the horned ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it thrives in full sun. Its distinctive feature is the elongated, horn-like bracts that surround the flower head, giving it its common name. Melampodium cornutum produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall."
