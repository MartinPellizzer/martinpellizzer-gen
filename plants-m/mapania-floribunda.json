    "intro": "Mapania floribunda, commonly known as the clustered flameflower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to red, often blooming in dense clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are adapted to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators with their nectar-rich structure. Mapania floribunda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
