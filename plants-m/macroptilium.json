    "intro": "Macroptilium, commonly known as the stylo species, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas and are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. They are often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a range of growth forms from annuals to perennials. Macroptilium species are valued for their ability to fix nitrogen, making them important in soil enrichment and forage production. Their seeds are typically small and can be dispersed by wind or animals, contributing to their adaptability and widespread distribution."
