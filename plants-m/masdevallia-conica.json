    "intro": "Masdevallia conica, commonly known as the conical masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and its striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble a cone. The plant typically produces a single, showy inflorescence with long, slender petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Masdevallia conica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often grown as a houseplant or in greenhouse conditions."
