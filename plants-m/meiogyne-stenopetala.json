    "intro": "Meiogyne stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled meiogyne, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Meiogyne stenopetala is considered a threatened species in its native range."
