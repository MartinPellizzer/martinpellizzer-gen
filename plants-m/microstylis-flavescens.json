    "intro": "Microstylis flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in spikes. Its inflorescence is usually yellowish-green, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. Microstylis flavescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
