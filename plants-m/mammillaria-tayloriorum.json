    "intro": "Mammillaria tayloriorum, commonly known as the Taylor's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahua Desert in northern Mexico. It is a small, solitary plant with a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels near the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
