    "intro": "Monanthes atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic monanthes, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty, windy environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Monanthes atlantica plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
