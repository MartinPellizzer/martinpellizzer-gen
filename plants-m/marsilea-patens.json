    "intro": "Marsilea patens, commonly known as the floating water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant thrives in shallow waters and is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of rivers. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus located on the underside of the fronds. Marsilea patens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
