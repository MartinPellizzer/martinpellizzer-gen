    "intro": "Montia perfoliata var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf perfoliate, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, succulent leaves that often fuse at the base, forming a cup-like structure around the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered with fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. This variety is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
