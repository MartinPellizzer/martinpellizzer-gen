    "intro": "Melocactus miquelii, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive swollen base and a crown of spines. The plant produces bright red flowers during the summer months, which are followed by fleshy, edible fruits resembling small apples. Its thick, ribbed stem stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Melocactus miquelii is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
