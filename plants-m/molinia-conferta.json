    "intro": "Molinia conferta, commonly known as tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit, with tall, cylindrical stems that often form tussocks. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that are typically golden or brown in color, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue. Molinia conferta is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, moors, and heathlands."
