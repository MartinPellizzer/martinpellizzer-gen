    "intro": "Myrtillocactus chiotilla, commonly known as the Chiotilla cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, woolly spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
