    "intro": "Mollugo multiflora, commonly known as common bladderwort, is a small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its tiny, bright yellow flowers and bladder-like structures on its stems. The plant is often found in moist, sandy soils and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. It is an annual herb that produces numerous small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Mollugo multiflora is also known for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms in its bladder-like structures, making it a unique example of a carnivorous plant."
