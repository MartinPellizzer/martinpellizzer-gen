    "intro": "Meconopsis integrifolia var. uniflora, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, typically on tall, slender stems. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture, adapted to the cold, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils at high altitudes, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and habitat sensitivity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens but remains rare in the wild."
