    "intro": "Meineckia neogranatensis, commonly known as the granatense meineckia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its distinctive, softly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with prominent stamens. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Meineckia neogranatensis is considered a vulnerable species."
