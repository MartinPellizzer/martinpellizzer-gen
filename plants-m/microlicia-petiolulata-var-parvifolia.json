It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, which bloom during the warmer months. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
