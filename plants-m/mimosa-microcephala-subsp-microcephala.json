    "intro": "Mimosa microcephala subsp. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained soil. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Due to its delicate appearance and unique response to touch, it is often cultivated as a ornamental plant."
