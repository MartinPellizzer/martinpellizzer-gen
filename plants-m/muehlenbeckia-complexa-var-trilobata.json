    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia complexa var. trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed muhlenbeckia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to New Zealand. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale green to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
