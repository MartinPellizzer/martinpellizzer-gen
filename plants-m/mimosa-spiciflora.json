    "intro": "Mimosa spiciflora, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, Mimosa spiciflora is often cultivated for both aesthetic and educational purposes."
