    "intro": "Monopogon avenaceus, commonly known as the common vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, elongated pods containing edible seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a forage crop and in soil conservation efforts. Monopogon avenaceus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
