It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for succulent collections."
