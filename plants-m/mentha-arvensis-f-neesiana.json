It is a variant of the field mint, characterized by its aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves and slender, creeping stems. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Neesian mint is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, making it useful in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
