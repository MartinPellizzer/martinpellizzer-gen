    "intro": "Microstylis jaraguae, commonly known as the Jaragua microstylis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of sedges, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
