    "intro": "Micranthus rupestris, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its succulent leaves and delicate flowers make it an attractive and resilient addition to dryland landscapes."
