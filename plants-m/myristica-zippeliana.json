    "intro": "Myristica zippeliana, commonly known as the Zippelian nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the spice-like seeds used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has glossy, elliptical leaves. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and phytochemistry. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
