    "intro": "Muraltia juniperifolia, commonly known as the Juniper-leaf Muraltia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and leathery, with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and seasonal flowering."
