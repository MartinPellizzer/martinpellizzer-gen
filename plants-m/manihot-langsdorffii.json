    "intro": "Manihot langsdorffii, commonly known as the Langsdorff's arrowleaf, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, arrow-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
