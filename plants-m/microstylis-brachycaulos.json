    "intro": "Microstylis brachycaulos, commonly known as the short-stemmed microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with compact, often hairy stems. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, making it a subtle yet distinctive botanical specimen. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
