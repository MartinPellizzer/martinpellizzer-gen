    "intro": "Miconia acutilamina, commonly known as the sharp-leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, broad leaves with a pointed tip. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom during the wet season. It is often found in humid lowland forests and can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
