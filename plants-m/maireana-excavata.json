    "intro": "Maireana excavata, commonly known as the mulga or mulga grass, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant in arid and semi-arid regions. Maireana excavata is well adapted to drought and can survive in poor soil conditions."
