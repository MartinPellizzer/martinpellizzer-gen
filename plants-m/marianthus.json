It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still water. Its flowers typically open at dawn and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Marianthus is revered in many cultures for its symbolic and spiritual significance."
