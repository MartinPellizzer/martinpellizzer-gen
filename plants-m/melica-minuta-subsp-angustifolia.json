    "intro": "Melica minuta subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family, and its flowers are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
