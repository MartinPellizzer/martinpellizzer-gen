    "intro": "Malaxis reichei, commonly known as the Reiche's Malaxis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single or few leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is known for its ephemeral blooming period, often appearing only briefly during the wet season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis reichei is considered a conservation concern in many parts of its range."
