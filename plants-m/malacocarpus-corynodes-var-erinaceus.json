It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are divided into narrow, linear segments that can reach several feet in length. The botanical features of this variant include its intricate leaf morphology and its adaptation to thrive in high humidity and indirect light conditions."
