    "intro": "Malacomeles paniculata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in dense, paniculate inflorescences. The plant is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
