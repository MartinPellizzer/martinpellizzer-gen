    "intro": "Myriopteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliffbrake, is a fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or cliff habitats. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. Myriopteris gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to arid conditions."
