    "intro": "Mammillaria radians var. daimonoceras, commonly known as the horned milk barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles that bear white, fluffy spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its unique morphology and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
