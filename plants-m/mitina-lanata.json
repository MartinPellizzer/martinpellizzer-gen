It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its hairy foliage helps to retain moisture and protect against intense sunlight. Mitina lanata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local medicine."
