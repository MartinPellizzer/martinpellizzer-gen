    "intro": "Marrubium odoratissimum, commonly known as the sweet hawthorn, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Marrubium odoratissimum is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
