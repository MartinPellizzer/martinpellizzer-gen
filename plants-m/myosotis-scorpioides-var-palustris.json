    "intro": "Myosotis scorpioides var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh forget-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, blue-violet flowers with five petals. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
