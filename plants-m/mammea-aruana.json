    "intro": "Mammea aruana, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange or red fruits containing a single seed. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Mammea aruana plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species."
