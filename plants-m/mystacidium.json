    "intro": "Mystacidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are pale green or white, often appearing in clusters, and are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and its rarity, Mystacidium is considered a threatened species."
