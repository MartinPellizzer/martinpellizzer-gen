    "intro": "Milium zonatum, commonly known as the zoned millet, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. Milium zonatum is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
