    "intro": "Maytenus guangnanensis, commonly known as Guangnan mayten, is a deciduous tree native to China, particularly in the Guangxi and Guangdong provinces. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray-barked trunk and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at low to moderate elevations. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
