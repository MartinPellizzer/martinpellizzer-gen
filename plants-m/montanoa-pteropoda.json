    "intro": "Montanoa pteropoda, commonly known as the Mexican velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically includes species with medicinal or ornamental value. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become an invasive species in non-native regions."
