    "intro": "Milla biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered milla, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access underground water. Milla biflora is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
