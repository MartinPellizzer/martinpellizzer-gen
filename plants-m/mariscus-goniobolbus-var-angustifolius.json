    "intro": "Mariscus goniobolbus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows."
