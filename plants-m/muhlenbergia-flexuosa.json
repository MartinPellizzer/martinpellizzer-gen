    "intro": "Muhlenbergia flexuosa, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fine, grass-like foliage that often forms dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Muhlenbergia flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
