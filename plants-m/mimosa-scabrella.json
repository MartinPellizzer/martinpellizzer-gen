    "intro": "Mimosa scabrella, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings."
