    "intro": "Mentzelia lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone soils. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mentzelia lindheimeri is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
