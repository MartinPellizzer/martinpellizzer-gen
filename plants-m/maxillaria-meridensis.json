    "intro": "Maxillaria meridensis, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that supports its growth during dry periods. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Maxillaria meridensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable growing conditions."
