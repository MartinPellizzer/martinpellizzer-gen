    "intro": "Mimosa virgula, commonly known as the small mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Mimosa virgula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits the surrounding soil."
