    "intro": "Mallotus oppositifolius f. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-leafed mallotus, is a variant of the mallotus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in humid tropical climates. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
