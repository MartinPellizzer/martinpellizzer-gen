    "intro": "Myrica rubra, commonly known as the Japanese wax tree or Chinese wax tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and small, elliptical leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by waxy, red berries that are edible and used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Myrica rubra is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
