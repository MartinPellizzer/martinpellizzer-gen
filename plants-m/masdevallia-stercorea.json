    "intro": "Masdevallia stercorea, commonly known as the \"stool orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs and produces delicate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its unique growth habit and striking blooms make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts. The name \"stercorea\" is derived from the Latin word for \"excrement,\" referring to the plant's ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils."
