    "intro": "Microsorum persicariifolium, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, fan-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water, contributing to its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate light exposure. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize sediment and improve water clarity. Microsorum persicariifolium is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
