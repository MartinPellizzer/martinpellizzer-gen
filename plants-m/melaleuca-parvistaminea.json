    "intro": "Melaleuca parvistaminea, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed tea tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, cylindrical stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Melaleuca parvistaminea is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
