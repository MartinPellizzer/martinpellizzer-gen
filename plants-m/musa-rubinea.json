    "intro": "Musa rubinea, commonly known as the red banana, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking reddish-purple coloration on the outer layer of its fruit, which contrasts with the usual yellow or green hues of other banana varieties. The plant belongs to the Musaceae family and is closely related to the common banana (Musa acuminata). Its leaves are large, broad, and have a waxy texture, typical of many banana species. The fruit is typically smaller than common bananas and has a slightly tart flavor, making it popular in local cuisines."
