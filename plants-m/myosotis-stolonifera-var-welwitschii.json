    "intro": "Myosotis stolonifera var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
