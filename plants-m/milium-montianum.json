    "intro": "Milium montianum, commonly known as the mountain millet, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Milium montianum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardiness and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
