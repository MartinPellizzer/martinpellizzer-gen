    "intro": "Mimosa setosa var. setosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
