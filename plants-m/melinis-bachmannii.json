    "intro": "Melinis bachmannii, commonly known as the Bachmann's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Melinis bachmannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
