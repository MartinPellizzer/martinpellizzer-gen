    "intro": "Miconia plukenetii, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia plukenetii is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
