    "intro": "Mikania cordifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly heartleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it both ecologically significant and a challenge in some ecosystems."
