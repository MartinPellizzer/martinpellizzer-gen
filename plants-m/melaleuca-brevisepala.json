    "intro": "Melaleuca brevisepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
