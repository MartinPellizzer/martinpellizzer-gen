    "intro": "Medicago truncatula var. rugosissima, commonly known as the rough medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is a valuable forage plant for livestock due to its high protein content and palatability. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
