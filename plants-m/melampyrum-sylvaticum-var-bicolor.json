    "intro": "Melampyrum sylvaticum var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored touch-me-not, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, which typically display a yellow base transitioning to red or purple at the tips. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in woodland and grassland habitats. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
