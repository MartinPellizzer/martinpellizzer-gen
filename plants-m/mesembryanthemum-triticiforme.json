It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Mesembryanthemum triticiforme is also known for its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained conditions."
