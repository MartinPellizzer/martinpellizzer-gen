    "intro": "Manihot pruinosa var. pumila, commonly known as the silky manioc, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange to red berries containing toxic seeds. It is closely related to the manioc plant, which is known for its starchy roots used in food and industry. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and plant ecology."
