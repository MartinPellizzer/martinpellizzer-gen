    "intro": "Micromyrtus helmsii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden coastal environments, making it resilient to harsh maritime conditions. Its small size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Micromyrtus helmsii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
