    "intro": "Macrocarpaea hilarula, commonly known as the Hilo dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dandelion-like appearance with yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Macrocarpaea hilarula is also notable for its small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution."
