    "intro": "Mimosa adhaerens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its stems are often covered in a soft, velvety pubescence, which gives it its common name. Mimosa adhaerens is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its use in traditional medicine."
