    "intro": "Medicago gerardi var. minor, commonly known as lesser sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and dry conditions. Lesser sainfoin is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
