    "intro": "Mimosa sensibilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa sensibilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique movement and delicate appearance."
