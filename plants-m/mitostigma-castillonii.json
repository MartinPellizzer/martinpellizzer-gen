It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Botanically, it exhibits a complex relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while also providing some ecological benefits. Its presence is often an indicator of specific forest ecosystems."
