    "intro": "Melilotus diffusus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Sweet clover is known for its high nitrogen content, making it valuable as a forage crop and in soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
