    "intro": "Medicago laciniata subsp. longispina, commonly known as the longspined sicklevetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and trifoliate leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
