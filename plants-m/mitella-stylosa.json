    "intro": "Mitella stylosa, commonly known as the pink mitella, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Saxifragaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant features delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often accompanied by lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Mitella stylosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
