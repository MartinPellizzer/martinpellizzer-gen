    "intro": "Malabaila tordylioides, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered in dense groups, and its flowers are typically white or yellow, with a sweet fragrance. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis through its own leaves."
