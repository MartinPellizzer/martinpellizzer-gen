    "intro": "Mascagnia renidens, commonly known as the red-leaf mescal bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-related species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically yellow or orange with a prominent dark throat. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal."
