    "intro": "Milium membranaceum, commonly known as the paper millet, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. It produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread in suitable environments. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological role, it is considered a valuable species in wetland restoration projects."
