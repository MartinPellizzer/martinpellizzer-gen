    "intro": "Myrsine serpenticola, commonly known as the serpent's tail myrsine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrsine serpenticola thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
