    "intro": "Myristica sogeriensis, commonly known as the Sogeri nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree that produces aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its unique double-ovulate fruit, which contains two seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red outer layer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface, while the bark is thick and rugged. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
