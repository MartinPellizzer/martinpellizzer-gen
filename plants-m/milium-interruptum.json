    "intro": "Milium interruptum, commonly known as the interrupted brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Milium interruptum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
