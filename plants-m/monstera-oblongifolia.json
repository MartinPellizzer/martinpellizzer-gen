    "intro": "Monstera oblongifolia, commonly known as the giant split-leaf philodendron, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop deep splits as the plant matures. The leaves are typically a glossy green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent watering to maintain its lush appearance. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its dramatic foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
