    "intro": "Montinia, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a yellow or orange throat. Montinia species are herbaceous perennials, often growing from 6 to 18 inches tall, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to their attractive flowers and adaptability, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they can be invasive in certain regions."
