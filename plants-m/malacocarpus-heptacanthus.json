    "intro": "Malacocarpus heptacanthus, commonly known as the seven-armed sea holly, is a unique marine plant found in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a sea star. The plant has a short, thick stem with branching arms that support its fleshy, waxy leaves. It thrives in areas with strong tidal currents and is often found in rocky substrates. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, making it an important component of intertidal ecosystems."
