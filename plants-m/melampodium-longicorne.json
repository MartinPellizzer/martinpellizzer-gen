    "intro": "Melampodium longicorne, commonly known as the coneflower or ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as prairies, marshes, and stream banks. It produces showy yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive central cone-like structure. Melampodium longicorne is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
