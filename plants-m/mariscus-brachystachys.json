It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slight waxy coating that helps it retain moisture.
