    "intro": "Medicago isthmocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Medicago isthmocarpa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
