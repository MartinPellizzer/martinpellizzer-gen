    "intro": "Micromeria sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai micromeria, is a small, annual herb native to the arid regions of the Middle East, particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments, exhibiting drought resistance and efficient water use. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
