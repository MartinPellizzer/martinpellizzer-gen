    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 sativa var. paludosa, commonly known as marsh mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its aromatic leaves and flowering spikes. It is native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and have a minty aroma similar to other Mentha species. The variety is distinguished by its preference for wet conditions and its role in ecological systems supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic life."
