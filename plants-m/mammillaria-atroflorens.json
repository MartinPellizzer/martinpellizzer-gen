    "intro": "Mammillaria atroflorens, commonly known as the black-flowered mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of small, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces striking, dark purple to black flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and cold hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
