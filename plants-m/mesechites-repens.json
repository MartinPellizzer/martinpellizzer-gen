    "intro": "Mesechites repens, commonly known as the creeping mesechites, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Mesechites repens thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
