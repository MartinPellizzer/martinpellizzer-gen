    "intro": "Microcos sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran microcos, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
