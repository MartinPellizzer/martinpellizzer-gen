    "intro": "Machaeranthera canescens var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
