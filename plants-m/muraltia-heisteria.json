It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its fruit is a fleshy, red drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance. Muraltia heisteria is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
