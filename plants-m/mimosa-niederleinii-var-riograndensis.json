    "intro": "Mimosa niederleinii var. riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow, spherical flower heads. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. The species is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in its native range."
