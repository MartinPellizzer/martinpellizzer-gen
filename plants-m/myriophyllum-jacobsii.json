    "intro": "Myriophyllum jacobsii, commonly known as Jacob's watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often found in freshwater lakes and ponds. The plant produces small, whorled leaves that are typically green and slightly pointed. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, appearing in late summer, and it is often mistaken for other watermilfoil species. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for fish and invertebrates."
