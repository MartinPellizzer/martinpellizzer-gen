    "intro": "Menziesia phylicifolia, commonly known as the sweet fern or white sweet fern, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and have a mild, sweet scent when crushed. Menziesia phylicifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
