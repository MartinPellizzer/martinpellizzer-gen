    "intro": "Mariscus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich soils along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating or submerged depending on water levels. Mariscus uniflorus plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and contributing to water filtration."
