    "intro": "Madronella dentata, commonly known as the toothed madrona, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Madronella dentata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
