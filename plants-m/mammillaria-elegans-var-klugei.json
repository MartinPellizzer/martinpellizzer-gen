It features a rounded stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, tuberculate areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom from the areoles. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
