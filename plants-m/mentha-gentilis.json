    "intro": "Mentha gentilis, commonly known as sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, menthol-like scent, which is derived from its essential oils. Mentha gentilis thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found near water bodies. It is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
