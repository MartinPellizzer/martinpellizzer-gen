    "intro": "Mespilus ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in late summer, though they are typically not consumed raw due to their astringent taste. Mespilus ovalifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It has historical significance in traditional medicine and horticulture."
