    "intro": "Mimosa balsamica, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light and touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa balsamica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
