    "intro": "Minuopsis nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's minuopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish-white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
