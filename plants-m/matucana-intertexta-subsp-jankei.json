    "intro": "Matucana intertexta subsp. jankei, commonly known as the Jankei's matucana, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in short, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping."
