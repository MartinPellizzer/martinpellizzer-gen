    "intro": "Marumia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf marumia, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in tropical regions."
