    "intro": "Machaerium oxyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved machaerium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds effectively. Machaerium oxyphyllum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
