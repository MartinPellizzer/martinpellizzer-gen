    "intro": "Mentha aucheri, commonly known as the alpine mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Mentha aucheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild mint-like fragrance."
