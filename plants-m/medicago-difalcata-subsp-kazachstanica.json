    "intro": "Medicago difalcata subsp. kazachstanica, commonly known as Kazakh clover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This subspecies is valued for its forage quality and ecological role in stabilizing soil in semi-arid regions."
