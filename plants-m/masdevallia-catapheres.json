    "intro": "Masdevallia catapheres, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and its unique, translucent, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer or early autumn, producing a delicate, fragrant aroma. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Masdevallia catapheres is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
