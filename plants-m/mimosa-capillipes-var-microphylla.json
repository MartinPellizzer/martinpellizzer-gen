    "intro": "Mimosa capillipes var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fern-like leaves that are often described as resembling the fingers of a hand. The plant produces delicate, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain environments."
