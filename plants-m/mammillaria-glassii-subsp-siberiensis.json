    "intro": "Mammillaria glassii subsp. siberiensis, commonly known as the Siberian mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Central Asia. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines and small, pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
