    "intro": "Miconia dorsiloba, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or false guava, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are similar in appearance to the common starfruit. Miconia dorsiloba is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
