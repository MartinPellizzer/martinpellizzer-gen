It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, which are typically a deep green with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often featured in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
