    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. sativa, commonly known as peppermint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, slightly fuzzy leaves and its distinctive square, hollow stems. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. Peppermint is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy, medicine, and flavoring. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
