    "intro": "Micromeria pulegium, commonly known as pennyroyal, is a small annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tiny, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its essential oils, particularly those containing pulegone, are used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
