    "intro": "Mascarenhasia kidroa, commonly known as the Mascarene starling orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Mascarene Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near the forest floor. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
