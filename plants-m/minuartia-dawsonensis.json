    "intro": "Minuartia dawsonensis, commonly known as Dawson's sandwort, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and closely arranged, forming a dense mat that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Minuartia dawsonensis is well adapted to extreme climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
