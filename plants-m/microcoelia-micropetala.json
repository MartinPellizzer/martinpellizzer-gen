    "intro": "Microcoelia micropetala, commonly known as the small-petaled microcoelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
