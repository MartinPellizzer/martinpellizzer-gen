    "intro": "Mercurialis dregeana, commonly known as the desert mercury, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows from 30 to 100 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a candle-like appearance. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
