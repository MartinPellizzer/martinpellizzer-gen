    "intro": "Meniocus serpyllifolius, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many agricultural and horticultural settings."
