    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate silky grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are finely hairy, giving it a silky appearance, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
