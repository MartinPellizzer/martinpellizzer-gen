    "intro": "Meliosma hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan meliosma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often pubescent and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its fruits are small, dry capsules containing several seeds. Meliosma hainanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
