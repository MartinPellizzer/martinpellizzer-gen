    "intro": "Maesobotrya liberica, commonly known as the Liberian coffee tree, is a species native to West Africa, particularly found in countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its seeds, enclosed within the berries, are the source of its caffeine content and are used in the production of coffee. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its ornamental and economic significance."
