    "intro": "Mertensia foliosa f. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's bluebells, is a rare and striking variant of the bluebells native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully emerge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
