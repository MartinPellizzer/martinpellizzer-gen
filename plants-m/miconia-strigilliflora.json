It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers with prominent, fleshy petals. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds. Miconia strigilliflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
