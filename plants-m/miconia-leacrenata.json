    "intro": "Miconia leacrenata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
