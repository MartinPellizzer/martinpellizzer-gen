    "intro": "Masdevallia coriacea subsp. bonplandii, commonly known as the Bonpland's rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, leathery foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, well-drained environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
