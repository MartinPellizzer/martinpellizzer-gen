    "intro": "Mammillaria hopferiana, commonly known as the Hopfer's nipple cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a spiny, segmented stem with white to pale green ribs and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
