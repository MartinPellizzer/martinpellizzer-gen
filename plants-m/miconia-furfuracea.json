    "intro": "Miconia furfuracea, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are often followed by orange to red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
