    "intro": "Millettia yangambiensis, commonly known as the Yangambi tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in local cuisines. It is also valued for its hard wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Millettia yangambiensis is considered vulnerable to extinction."
