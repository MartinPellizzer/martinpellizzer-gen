    "intro": "Melandrium alaschanicum, commonly known as the Alaska catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Melandrium alaschanicum is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats."
