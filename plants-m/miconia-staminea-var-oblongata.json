    "intro": "Miconia staminea var. oblongata, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, woody, spiky fruits. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
