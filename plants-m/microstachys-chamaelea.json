    "intro": "Microstachys chamaelea, commonly known as the creeping grassvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, usually green or reddish, flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Microstachys chamaelea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
