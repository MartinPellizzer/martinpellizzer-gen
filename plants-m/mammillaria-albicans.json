    "intro": "Mammillaria albicans, commonly known as the white-furred hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a whitish, woolly coating on its stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by pale green fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
