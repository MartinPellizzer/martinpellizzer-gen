    "intro": "Mikania gleasonii, commonly known as the Gleason's mile-a-minute weed, is a rapidly growing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
