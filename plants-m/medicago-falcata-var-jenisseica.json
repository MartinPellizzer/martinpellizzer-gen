    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. jenisseica, commonly known as the Siberian clover, is a variant of the common medick, native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. This plant is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including permafrost and low temperatures. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its resilience makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in arctic and alpine regions."
