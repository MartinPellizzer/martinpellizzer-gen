The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its botanical structure includes fibrous roots and a basal rosette of leaves, typical of many members of the Asphodelaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
