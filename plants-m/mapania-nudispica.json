    "intro": "Mapania nudispica, commonly known as the naked-stemmed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. Mapania nudispica thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
