    "intro": "Malvastrum nesioticum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a hairy stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Malvastrum nesioticum is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
