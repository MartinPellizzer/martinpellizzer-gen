    "intro": "Masdevallia chimaera var. wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns of purple and white, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high air circulation and is often found growing on tree trunks or among mossy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
