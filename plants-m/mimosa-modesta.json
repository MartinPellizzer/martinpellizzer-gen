    "intro": "Mimosa modesta, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system has the ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment. Mimosa modesta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and responsive foliage."
