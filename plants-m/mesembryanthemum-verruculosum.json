    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum verruculosum, commonly known as the yellow mesem, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Mesembryanthemum verruculosum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
