    "intro": "Mediocalcar sepikanum, commonly known as the Sepik sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
