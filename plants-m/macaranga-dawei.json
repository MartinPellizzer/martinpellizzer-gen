    "intro": "Macaranga dawei, commonly known as the white-veined macaranga, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an important pioneer species in tropical ecosystems. Macaranga dawei also plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing food and shelter for various insects and birds."
