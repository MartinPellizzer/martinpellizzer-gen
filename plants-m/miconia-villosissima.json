    "intro": "Miconia villosissima, commonly known as the hairy miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain regions."
