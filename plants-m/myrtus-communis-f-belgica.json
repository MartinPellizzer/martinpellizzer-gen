    "intro": "Myrtus communis f. belgica, commonly known as the Belgian myrtle, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Belgium and northern France. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, and it produces tiny, white, fragrant flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, slightly acidic soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its ornate foliage and subtle fragrance. This variety is particularly valued for its hardiness and suitability for coastal gardens."
