    "intro": "Myriophyllum lapidicola, commonly known as the stone milfoil, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often finely toothed. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Myriophyllum lapidicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life."
