    "intro": "Minaria acerosa, commonly known as the hardstem minaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of North America, particularly in the western United States, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Minaria acerosa is often found in open areas such as grasslands and along streambanks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment."
