It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its compact, rounded growth form gives it its common name, and it is often found in regions with mild, Mediterranean climates. It is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
