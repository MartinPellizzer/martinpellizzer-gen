    "intro": "Mammillaria rectispina, commonly known as the straight-spined mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact size and unique spination make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
