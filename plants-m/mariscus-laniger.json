    "intro": "Mariscus laniger, commonly known as the woolly marsh plant, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
