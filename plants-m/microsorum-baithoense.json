    "intro": "Microsorum baithoense, commonly known as the Baitho fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the substrate while also facilitating nutrient absorption. Microsorum baithoense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its filtration properties."
