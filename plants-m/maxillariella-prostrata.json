    "intro": "Maxillariella prostrata, commonly known as the flat orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, grass-like leaves that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Maxillariella prostrata is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids in the understory of tropical forests."
