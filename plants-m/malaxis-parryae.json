    "intro": "Malaxis parryae, commonly known as Parry's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions, preferring cool and moist environments. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the summer months. Malaxis parryae is relatively rare and is often found in specific habitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
