    "intro": "Myriophyllum decussatum, commonly known as watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, often forming dense underwater stands. The plant is typically submerged, with its roots anchoring it to the substrate while its stems and leaves float at the water's surface. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense spikes and are pollinated by wind or insects. Myriophyllum decussatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
