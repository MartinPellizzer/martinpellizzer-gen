It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
