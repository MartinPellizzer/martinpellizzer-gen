    "intro": "Maharanga griersonii, commonly known as the Kauri tree, is a rare and ancient conifer native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree can grow up to 50 meters in height and has a lifespan that can exceed 1,000 years. Its cones are small and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and historical logging, it is now critically endangered and protected in its native range."
