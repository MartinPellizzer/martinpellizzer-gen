    "intro": "Mespilus glabra, commonly known as the white serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish-white berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Mespilus glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
