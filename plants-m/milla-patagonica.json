    "intro": "Milla patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Milla patagonica is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils."
