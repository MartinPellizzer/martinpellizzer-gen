It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruit is a round, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. The plant is adapted to thrive in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats."
