    "intro": "Mayaca wrightii, commonly known as Wright's mayaca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white to pale green flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Mayaca wrightii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support local biodiversity."
