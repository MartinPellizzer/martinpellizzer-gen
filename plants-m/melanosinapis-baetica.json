    "intro": "Melanosinapis baetica, commonly known as the Iberian black orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers, which are strikingly different from the typical colors of most orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous or forested regions. Its botanical features include a slender rhizome and lance-shaped leaves, which are adapted to its specific ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
