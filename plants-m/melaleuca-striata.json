    "intro": "Melaleuca striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and brown, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow and strap-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Melaleuca striata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
