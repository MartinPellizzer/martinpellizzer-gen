    "intro": "Mimosa annularis, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, deciduous leaves that are often shed during dry periods. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems. Mimosa annularis is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand salt spray."
