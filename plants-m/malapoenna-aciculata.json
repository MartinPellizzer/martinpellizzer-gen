    "intro": "Malapoenna aciculata, commonly known as the needleleaf malapoenna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, white or yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
