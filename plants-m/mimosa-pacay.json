    "intro": "Mimosa pacay, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its soft, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod that splits open when mature. Mimosa pacay is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
