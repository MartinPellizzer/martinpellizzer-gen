    "intro": "Mimosa somnians var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut in response to touch or changes in light, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor or outdoor cultivation. Its unique botanical features and responsive behavior make it an intriguing subject for both scientific study and horticultural interest."
