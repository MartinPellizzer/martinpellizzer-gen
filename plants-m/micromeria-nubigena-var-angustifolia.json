    "intro": "Micromeria nubigena var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with stems that often lie close to the ground. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
