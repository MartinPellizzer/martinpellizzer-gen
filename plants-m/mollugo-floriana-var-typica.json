    "intro": "Mollugo floriana var. typica, commonly known as the common carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a carpet-like growth. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides."
