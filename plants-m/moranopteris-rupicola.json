    "intro": "Moranopteris rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Moranopteris rupicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native habitat."
