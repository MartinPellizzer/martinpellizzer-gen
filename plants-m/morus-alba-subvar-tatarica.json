    "intro": "Morus alba subvar. tatarica, commonly known as the Tatarian mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are typically green when immature and turn dark purple or black when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value. The species is also notable for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and its historical use in silk production."
