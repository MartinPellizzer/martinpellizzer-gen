    "intro": "Manihot esculenta var. rufescens, commonly known as the red manioc, is a variant of the cassava plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its reddish stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more common white or yellow manioc varieties. The plant produces edible tuberous roots that are rich in starch and used as a food source in various cuisines. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a woody, fibrous stem. It is also cultivated for its potential in biofuel production due to its high biomass yield."
