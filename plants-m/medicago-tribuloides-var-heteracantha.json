It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant has a taproot system and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
