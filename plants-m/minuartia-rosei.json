    "intro": "Minuartia rosei, commonly known as the rose rockcress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Minuartia rosei is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy species in mountainous and coastal regions."
