    "intro": "Monophyllaea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved monophyllaea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reflect light and reduce water loss. Monophyllaea grandifolia is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
