    "intro": "Mimosa notata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique foliage and adaptive responses make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
