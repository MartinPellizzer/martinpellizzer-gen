    "intro": "Marrubium cordatum, commonly known as the heart-leaved horehound, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It has a strong, bitter aroma due to the presence of essential oils. Marrubium cordatum is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
