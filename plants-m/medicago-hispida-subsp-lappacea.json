    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. lappacea, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Medicago hispida subsp. lappacea is often used in ecological restoration and as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
