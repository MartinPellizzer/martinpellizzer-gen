    "intro": "Micromeria weilleri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Micromeria weilleri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
