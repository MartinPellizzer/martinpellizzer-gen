    "intro": "Mandevilla macrophylla, commonly known as the giant mandevilla, is a striking tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. Mandevilla macrophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vigorous growth and long-lasting floral display."
