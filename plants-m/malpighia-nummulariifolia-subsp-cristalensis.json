    "intro": "Malpighia nummulariifolia subsp. cristalensis, commonly known as the Crystal Apple, is a shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its small, round, bright red berries that resemble tiny apples, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
