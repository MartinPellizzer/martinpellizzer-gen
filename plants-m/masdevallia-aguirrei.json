    "intro": "Masdevallia aguirrei, commonly known as the Aguirre's masdevallia, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers, which can be strikingly vivid, often display a combination of purple, pink, and white hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
