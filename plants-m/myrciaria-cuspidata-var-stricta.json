    "intro": "Myrciaria cuspidata var. stricta, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *cereja-brasileira*, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible and often consumed by birds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
