    "intro": "Mikania nubigena, commonly known as the cloud vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense foliage. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain areas."
