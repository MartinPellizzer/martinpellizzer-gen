It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its trunk is thick and woody, often covered in a fibrous outer layer. Native to certain regions of Africa, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
