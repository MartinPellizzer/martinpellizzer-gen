    "intro": "Muhlenbergia virletii, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, fluffy seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps. Muhlenbergia virletii is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
