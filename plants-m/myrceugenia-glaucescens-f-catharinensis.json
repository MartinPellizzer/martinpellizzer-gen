    "intro": "Myrceugenia glaucescens f. catharinensis, commonly known as the Catharina myrtle, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
