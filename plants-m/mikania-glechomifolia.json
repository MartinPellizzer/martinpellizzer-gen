    "intro": "Mikania glechomifolia, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are typically hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the morning. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an aggressive weed in many regions."
