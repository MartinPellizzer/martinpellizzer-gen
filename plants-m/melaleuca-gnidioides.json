    "intro": "Melaleuca gnidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers in spikes, which are typically borne in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. Melaleuca gnidioides is often found in coastal or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
