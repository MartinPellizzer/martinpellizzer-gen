    "intro": "Mimosa obtusifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Mimosa obtusifolia is also known for its ability to grow in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
