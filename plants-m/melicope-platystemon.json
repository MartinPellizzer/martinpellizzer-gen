    "intro": "Melicope platystemon, commonly known as the Hawaiian mahogany, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and flowers. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, with smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and has cultural significance in Hawaiian traditions."
