    "intro": "Mimosa bicolor, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it an intriguing subject for both scientific study and botanical appreciation."
