    "intro": "Medinilla annulata, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Medinilla annulata thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal. Its unique appearance and ability to bloom year-round make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
