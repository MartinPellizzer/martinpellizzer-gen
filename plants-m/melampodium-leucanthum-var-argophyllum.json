It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and bright yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
