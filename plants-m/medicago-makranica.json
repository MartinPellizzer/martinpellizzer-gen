    "intro": "Medicago makranica, commonly known as Makran clover, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Medicago makranica is also valued for its potential in forage and ecological restoration in semi-arid landscapes."
