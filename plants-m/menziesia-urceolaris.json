    "intro": "Menziesia urceolaris, commonly known as the urn-shaped menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are edible for some bird species, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a leathery texture, often with a bluish-green hue. Menziesia urceolaris thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
