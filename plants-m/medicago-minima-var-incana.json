    "intro": "Medicago minima var. incana, commonly known as the hairy sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. The plant has finely divided, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in full sun. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and forage in certain ecosystems."
