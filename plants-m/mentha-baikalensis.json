    "intro": "Mentha baikalensis, commonly known as Siberian mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and the Far East. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Mentha baikalensis is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent and is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
