    "intro": "Meum vulgare, commonly known as common meadow vetcher, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Meum vulgare is typically found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
