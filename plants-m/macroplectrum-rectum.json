It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and purple, with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found in tropical rainforests."
