    "intro": "Melica laxiflora var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in loose panicles, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is characterized by its lack of pubescence, giving it a smooth appearance compared to other varieties of Melica."
