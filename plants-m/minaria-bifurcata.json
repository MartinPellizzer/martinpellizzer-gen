    "intro": "Minaria bifurcata, commonly known as the bifurcated minaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
