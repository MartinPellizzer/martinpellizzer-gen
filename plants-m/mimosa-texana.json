    "intro": "Mimosa texana, commonly known as the Texas mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow-pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in sandy or clay soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. It has a shallow root system and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. The Texas mimosa is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait that gives it its common name."
