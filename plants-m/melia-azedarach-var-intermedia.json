    "intro": "Melia azedarach var. intermedia, commonly known as the Chinese white ash or Chinese cedar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive, palmately compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by spiny, woody fruits containing toxic seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine. Due to its fast growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
