It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its growth habit is compact and upright. Miquelina thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
