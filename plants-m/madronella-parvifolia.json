It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a notable species within its native habitat, though it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated."
