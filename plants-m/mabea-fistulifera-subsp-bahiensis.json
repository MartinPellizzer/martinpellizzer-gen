    "intro": "Mabea fistulifera subsp. bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber vine, is a climbing shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinct aroma. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is valued for its rubber-like latex, which has been historically used in industrial applications. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
