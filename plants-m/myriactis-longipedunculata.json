    "intro": "Myriactis longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stalked myriactis, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Myriaptyllaceae. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which support its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and moths."
