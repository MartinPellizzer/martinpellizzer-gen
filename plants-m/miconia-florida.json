    "intro": "Miconia florida, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
