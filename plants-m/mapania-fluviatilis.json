    "intro": "Mapania fluviatilis, commonly known as the river mapania, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant has a simple, branching stem that supports its foliage and aids in photosynthesis. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with abundant sunlight. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for water quality."
