    "intro": "Muiria hortenseae, commonly known as the garden muiria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Muiria hortenseae is considered a conservation concern."
