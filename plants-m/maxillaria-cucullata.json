    "intro": "Maxillaria cucullata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flower that resembles a miniature helmet, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, forming a rosette that helps conserve moisture. The flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring, are often pale pink or white with contrasting purple or brown markings."
