    "intro": "Metrosideros stipularis, commonly known as the New Zealand Christmas tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its bright red flowers that bloom in late summer, typically around December, hence its common name. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. It produces distinctive, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. The species is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
