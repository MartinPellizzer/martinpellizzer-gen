It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with triangular stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist soils in temperate regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly rough texture. Microstylis liparidoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native wetland habitats."
