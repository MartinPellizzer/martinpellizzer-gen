    "intro": "Melocactus andinus subsp. andinus, commonly known as the Andean melon cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that typically measures between 10 to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces striking, red or orange flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
