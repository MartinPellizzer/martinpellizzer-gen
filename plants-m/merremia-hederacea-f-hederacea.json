    "intro": "Merremia hederacea f. hederacea, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous trailing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover or as a climbing plant in gardens. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly due to its extensive root system and prolific seed production."
