    "intro": "Malus fusca var. levipes, commonly known as the western sand cherry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched structure and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant has oval, deciduous leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but not typically cultivated for consumption."
