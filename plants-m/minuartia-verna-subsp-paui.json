    "intro": "Minuartia verna subsp. paui, commonly known as the spring sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
