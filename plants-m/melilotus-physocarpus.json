    "intro": "Melilotus physocarpus, commonly known as the bladderpod melilot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are inflated and contain small, rounded seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
