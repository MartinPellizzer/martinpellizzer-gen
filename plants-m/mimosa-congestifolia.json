    "intro": "Mimosa congestifolia, commonly known as the clustered sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its sensitive nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
