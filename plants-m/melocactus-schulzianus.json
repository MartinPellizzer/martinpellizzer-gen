    "intro": "Melocactus schulzianus, commonly known as the Schulzian melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant features a ribbed stem that can grow up to 20 centimeters in height, and it produces yellow flowers during the rainy season. It is well adapted to dry environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb water efficiently. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
