    "intro": "Mariscus mariscoides, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet conditions."
