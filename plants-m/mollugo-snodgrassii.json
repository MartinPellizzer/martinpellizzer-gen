    "intro": "Mollugo snodgrassii, commonly known as the desert carpetweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils. Mollugo snodgrassii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
