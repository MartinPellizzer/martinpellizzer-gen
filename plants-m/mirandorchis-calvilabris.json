    "intro": "Mirandorchis calvilabris, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including hairy stems and leaves, which are adaptations to its particular ecological niche. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mirandorchis calvilabris is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
