    "intro": "Mentzelia monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Lake toothplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly around Mono Lake in California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. Mentzelia monoensis is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access moisture. It is also notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators."
