    "intro": "Moranopteris aphelolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Moranopteris aphelolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
