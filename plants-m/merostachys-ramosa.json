    "intro": "Merostachys ramosa, commonly known as the hairy bamboo or slender bamboo, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often branch profusely, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. Merostachys ramosa is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique growth habit."
