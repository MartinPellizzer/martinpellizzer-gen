    "intro": "Maniltoa basifoliola, commonly known as the broadleaf maniltoa, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is typically found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Maniltoa basifoliola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
