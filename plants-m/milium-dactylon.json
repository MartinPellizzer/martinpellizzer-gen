    "intro": "Milium dactylon, commonly known as the common millet or prostrate millet, is a low-growing annual grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. Milium dactylon is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
