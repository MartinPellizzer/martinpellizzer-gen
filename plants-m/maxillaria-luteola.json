    "intro": "Maxillaria luteola, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a common feature in many orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are known for their fragrant scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Maxillaria luteola is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
