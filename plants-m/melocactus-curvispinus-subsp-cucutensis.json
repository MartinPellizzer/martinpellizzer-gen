    "intro": "Melocactus curvispinus subsp. cucutensis, commonly known as the Cucuteni melocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to two meters in height, often with a distinctive red or orange coloration. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
