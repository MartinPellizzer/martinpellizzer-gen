    "intro": "Microlophus pseudobehen, commonly known as the Andean rock lizard, is a species of iguana native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender body, short tail, and distinctive coloration that varies with environmental conditions. The plant's name is sometimes confused with the genus Microlophus, which refers to a group of lizards, not plants. It is adapted to rocky habitats and exhibits a range of color morphs as a form of camouflage. This species plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems."
