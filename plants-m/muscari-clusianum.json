    "intro": "Muscari clusianum, commonly known as the Persian glory-of-the-snow, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its bulbs are toxic if ingested, so care should be taken when handling the plant. Muscari clusianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize over time in suitable conditions."
