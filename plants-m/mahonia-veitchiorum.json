    "intro": "Mahonia veitchiorum, commonly known as the Veitch's mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features compound leaves with spiny tips and is characterized by its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark blue berries that are edible but often unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
