    "intro": "Macronema greenei var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-hair macronema, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely textured, hairy leaves that give it its common name, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbrella-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
