    "intro": "Mammillaria decipiens subsp. camptotricha, commonly known as the hooked mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its delicate structure, it is often cultivated as a compact, ornamental specimen in arid gardens."
