    "intro": "Mimosa laticifera, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the release of a sticky latex. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Its milky sap, which contains a latex, is a notable botanical feature. Mimosa laticifera is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and unique reactive foliage."
