    "intro": "Muhlenbergia affinis, commonly known as the pink muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces airy, pinkish to purple plumes of flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its fine, silver-green foliage adds ornamental value throughout the growing season. Muhlenbergia affinis is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
