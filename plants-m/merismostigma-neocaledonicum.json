    "intro": "Merismostigma neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian fern, is a unique species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which may play a role in attracting specific insect pollinators. This botanical feature makes it an important subject for ecological and evolutionary studies."
