    "intro": "Manitia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and alternate, simple leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Manitia is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
