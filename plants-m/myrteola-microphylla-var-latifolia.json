    "intro": "Myrteola microphylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved myrteola, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season, followed by small, woody fruits containing pale, fleshy seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
