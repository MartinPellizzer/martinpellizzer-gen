    "intro": "Mariscus glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a distinctive glandular surface, giving it a slightly sticky texture. Mariscus glandulosus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
