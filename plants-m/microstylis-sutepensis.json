    "intro": "Microstylis sutepensis, commonly known as the Sutep's microstylis, is a rare flowering plant native to the highland regions of Peru. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its small, delicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and its flowers are clustered in tight, spike-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
