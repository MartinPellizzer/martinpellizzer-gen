It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant does not produce flowers and is propagated through rhizome division or by attaching spores to a substrate. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and is popular in planted aquariums. Its ability to tolerate a wide range of water parameters makes it a favored choice for both beginner and advanced aquarists."
