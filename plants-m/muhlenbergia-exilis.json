It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton or dandelion fluff, adding a decorative element to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Muhlenbergia exilis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
