    "intro": "Mariscus luteus, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed environments. Mariscus luteus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
