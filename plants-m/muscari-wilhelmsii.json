    "intro": "Muscari wilhelmsii, commonly known as the Persian grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, blooming in early spring. Muscari wilhelmsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
