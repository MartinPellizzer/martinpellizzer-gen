    "intro": "Manulea incana, commonly known as the silverleaf manulea, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Manulea incana is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
