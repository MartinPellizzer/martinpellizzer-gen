It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their large, arrow-shaped leaves and striking inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Macropanax species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their dramatic foliage and unique flowering structures. They typically thrive in moist, well-drained soil and require a humid environment to flourish."
