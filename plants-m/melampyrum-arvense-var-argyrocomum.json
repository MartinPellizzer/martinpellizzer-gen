    "intro": "Melampyrum arvense var. argyrocomum, commonly known as silverleaf betony, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or pale coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
