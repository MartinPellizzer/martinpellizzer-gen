    "intro": "Minuartia cerastiifolia, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature. Minuartia cerastiifolia is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions."
