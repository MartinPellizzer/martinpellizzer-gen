    "intro": "Microcaryum trichocarpum, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor it in the substrate while its fronds remain buoyant on the water surface. Microcaryum trichocarpum thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its simple, fern-like structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
