    "intro": "Microlepia henriettae, commonly known as Henrietta's chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that form a cascading appearance, resembling a chain. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
