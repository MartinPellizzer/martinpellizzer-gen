    "intro": "Marsilea macrocarpa, commonly known as water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like floating leaves, which are often mistaken for the common lucky clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include small, floating fruits that release spores into the water. Marsilea macrocarpa is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
