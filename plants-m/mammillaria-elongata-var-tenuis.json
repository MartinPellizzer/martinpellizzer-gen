    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardiness and unique aesthetic."
