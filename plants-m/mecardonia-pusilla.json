    "intro": "Mecardonia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mecardonia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbel-shaped inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
