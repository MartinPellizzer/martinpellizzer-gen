    "intro": "Miconia ebracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by orange to red berries that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
