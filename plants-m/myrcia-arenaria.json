    "intro": "Myrcia arenaria, commonly known as the sand myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Myrcia arenaria is well adapted to sandy and coastal soils, making it a hardy plant in challenging environments."
