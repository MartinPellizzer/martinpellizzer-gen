    "intro": "Melica papilionacea, commonly known as the pink false brome, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and produces small, pinkish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, hairy texture. Melica papilionacea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
