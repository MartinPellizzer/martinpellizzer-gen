It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive crown-like structure at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Mucuna cristata is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature."
