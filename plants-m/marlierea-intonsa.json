    "intro": "Marlierea intonsa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. Marlierea intonsa is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
