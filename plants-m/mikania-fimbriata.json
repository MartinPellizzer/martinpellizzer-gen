    "intro": "Mikania fimbriata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rapid growth and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
