    "intro": "Miconia morichensis, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
