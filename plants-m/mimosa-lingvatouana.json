It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal dunes or along the sea shore. The plant produces small, yellow, fern-like leaves and is known for its rapid growth and ability to withstand salt spray. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mimosa lingvatouana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature."
