    "intro": "Myrtus dioica, commonly known as common myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, dark green leaves and small, urn-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a notable botanical feature. Its fruits are small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
