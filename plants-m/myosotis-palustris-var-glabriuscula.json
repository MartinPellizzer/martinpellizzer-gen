    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth marsh forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in loose clusters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
