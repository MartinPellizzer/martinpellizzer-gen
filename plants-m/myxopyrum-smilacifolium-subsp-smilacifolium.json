    "intro": "Myxopyrum smilacifolium subsp. smilacifolium, commonly known as the smilacifolium saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and its distinctive, leaf-like stems that resemble leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
