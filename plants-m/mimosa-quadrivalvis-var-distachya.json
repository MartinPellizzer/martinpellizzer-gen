    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis var. distachya, commonly known as the variable mimosa, is a species native to parts of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its stems are woody and often branched, with a tendency to root at the nodes. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small leaflets that give it a feathery appearance."
