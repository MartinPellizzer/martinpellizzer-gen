    "intro": "Miconia euphorbioides, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
