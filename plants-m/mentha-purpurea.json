    "intro": "Mentha purpurea, commonly known as purple mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, often in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a distinct minty scent and flavor. Mentha purpurea is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though it is less common than other mint species."
