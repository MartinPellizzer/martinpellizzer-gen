It is characterized by its intricate, spirally arranged thallus, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its structure consists of a leafy, stem-like axis with closely packed, overlapping leaves. Mecodium intricatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
