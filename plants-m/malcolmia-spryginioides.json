It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its leaves. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
