    "intro": "Manihot pinatiloba, commonly known as the wild cassava or Brazilian arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a shrub-like species that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are tuberous and can be harvested for their starchy content, though they are not as widely cultivated as other cassava species. The plant is also valued for its potential in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel."
