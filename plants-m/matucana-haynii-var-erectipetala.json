    "intro": "Matucana haynii var. erectipetala, commonly known as the upright-petaled matucana, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant produces rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers are borne on long, erect inflorescences, giving it its varietal name. This species is prized for its ornamental value and requires bright, indirect light and high humidity to thrive."
