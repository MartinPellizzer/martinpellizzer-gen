    "intro": "Miconia fockeana, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia fockeana is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact native ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other tropical regions."
