    "intro": "Malaxis licatae, commonly known as the licatae orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
