    "intro": "Milla capitata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milla, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, upright growth with narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
