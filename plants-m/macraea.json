    "intro": "Macraea, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, with some species found in Asia and Australia. They are characterized by their woody stems, compound leaves, and showy, often fragrant flowers. Macraea species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Their seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by animals, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats."
