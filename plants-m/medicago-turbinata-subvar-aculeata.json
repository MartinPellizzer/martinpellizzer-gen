    "intro": "Medicago turbinata subvar. aculeata, commonly known as the aculeate sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. This subvariety is often used in forage and soil stabilization due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
