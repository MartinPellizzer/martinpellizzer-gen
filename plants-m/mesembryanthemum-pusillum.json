    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum pusillum, commonly known as the small-flowered ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that often open in response to light. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small, star-shaped, and often display a range of colors from white to pink, blooming in late spring or early summer."
