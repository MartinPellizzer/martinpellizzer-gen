    "intro": "Melananthus dipyrenoides, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, deciduous tree characterized by its dark, hard wood and compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its dense wood and ecological importance, it is valued for both traditional uses and conservation efforts."
