    "intro": "Munroidendron, commonly known as the African milkwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters, with a thick, often flaky bark that exudes a milky sap when damaged. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. The plant is adapted to arid conditions and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
