    "intro": "Muscaria micropetala, commonly known as the small-petaled fly agaric, is a species of psychedelic mushroom native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its pale yellow to ochre-colored cap, which is often covered with a fine, powdery coating. The stem is short and bulbous, with a distinct ring near the base. Its gills are pale yellow and closely spaced, and it produces spores in a distinctive, sticky layer. This species is closely related to the more famous Amanita muscaria but is less commonly encountered in the wild."
