    "intro": "Mesanthemum pubescens f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered mesanthemum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Aizoaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, daisy-like white flowers. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments. The varietal form 'alba' distinguishes it by its pure white flowers, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
