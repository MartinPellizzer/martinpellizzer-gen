    "intro": "Mammea glaucifolia, commonly known as the white mammea, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale-gray bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
