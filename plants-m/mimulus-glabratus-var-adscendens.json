    "intro": "Mimulus glabratus var. adscendens, commonly known as the ascending yellow monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
