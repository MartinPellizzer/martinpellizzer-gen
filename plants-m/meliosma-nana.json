    "intro": "Meliosma nana, commonly known as the dwarf meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens."
