    "intro": "Monardella linoides var. viminea, commonly known as the pink monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. This variety is closely related to other Monardella species, sharing similar ecological preferences and pollination strategies. It is often found in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
