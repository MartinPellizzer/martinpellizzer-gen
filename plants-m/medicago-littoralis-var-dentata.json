    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. dentata, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments and along shorelines. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing forage for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
