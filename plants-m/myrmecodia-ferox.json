    "intro": "Myrmecodia ferox, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that form a hollow, chamber-like structure. The plant provides shelter and nesting sites for ants, which in turn protect it from herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth, leathery texture. Myrmecodia ferox is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and symbiotic relationship with ants."
