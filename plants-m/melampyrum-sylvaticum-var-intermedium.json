    "intro": "Melampyrum sylvaticum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lanceolate leaves with a distinctive reddish hue. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, blooming in late summer. The species is characterized by its intermediate morphology between the two varieties of Melampyrum sylvaticum."
