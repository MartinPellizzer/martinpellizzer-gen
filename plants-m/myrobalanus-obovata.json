    "intro": "Myrobalanus obovata, commonly known as the rough-edged tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern China, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its obovate, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, acidic fruits resembling small, elongated pods. Its fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, sour pulp, which is used in traditional cuisines. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
