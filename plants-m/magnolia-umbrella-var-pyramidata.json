    "intro": "Magnolia umbrella var. pyramidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree has a pyramidal shape when young, which becomes more rounded with age. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its elegant white or pink flowers."
