    "intro": "Moenchia mantica subsp. mantica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved moenchia, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in grasslands and along streambanks. The plant features slender, ascending stems with alternate, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom in early summer. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator biodiversity."
