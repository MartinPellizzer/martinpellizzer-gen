    "intro": "Machaerium ulei, commonly known as the golden machaerium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna or woodland habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be used for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Machaerium ulei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
