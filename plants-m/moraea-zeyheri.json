    "intro": "Moraea zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's glory, is a South African species belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically blooms in spring and is found in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
