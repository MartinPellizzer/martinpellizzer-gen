    "intro": "Maughania rhodocarpa var. hockii, commonly known as the Hockii Mahogany, is a rare and valuable tropical tree species native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic heartwood that is highly sought after for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 30-40 meters and has a broad, spreading canopy with lanceolate, glossy leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in panicles, and it produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
