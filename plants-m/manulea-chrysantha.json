It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
