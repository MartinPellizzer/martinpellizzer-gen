    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 vesana, commonly known as spearmint, is a hybrid mint species resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha viridis (oval-leaf mint). It is characterized by its upright, spear-shaped leaves and a distinct, sharp, and cool menthol aroma. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its flowers are typically small and tubular, arranged in dense spikes, and it is widely cultivated for its aromatic leaves used in food, beverages, and medicinal applications. Spearmint is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
