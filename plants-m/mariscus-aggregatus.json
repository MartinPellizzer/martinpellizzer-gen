    "intro": "Mariscus aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that are covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a velvety texture, often with a slight reddish hue on the underside. Mariscus aggregatus thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams."
