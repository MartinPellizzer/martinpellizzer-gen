    "intro": "Microsorum tuanense, commonly known as Tuan's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Microsorum tuanense is often used in ornamental aquatic gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
