    "intro": "Manglietia pubipedunculata, commonly known as the pink manglietia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Magnoliaceae, which includes some of the most ancient flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
