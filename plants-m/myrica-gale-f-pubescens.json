    "intro": "Myrica gale f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream edges. The hairy wax myrtle is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
