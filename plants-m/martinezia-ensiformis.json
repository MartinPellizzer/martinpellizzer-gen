    "intro": "Martinezia ensiformis, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in landscaping."
