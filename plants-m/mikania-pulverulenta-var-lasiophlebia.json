    "intro": "Mikania pulverulenta var. lasiophlebia, commonly known as the hairy leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both sides, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive if not controlled."
