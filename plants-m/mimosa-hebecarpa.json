    "intro": "Mimosa hebecarpa, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, spherical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for dry gardens. Mimosa hebecarpa is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed."
