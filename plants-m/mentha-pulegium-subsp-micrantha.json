    "intro": "Mentha pulegium subsp. micrantha, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges or stream banks. Its essential oils, containing pulegone, are used in traditional medicine but are toxic to livestock."
