    "intro": "Mirabilis \u00d7 serotina, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
