    "intro": "Melica viridiflora, commonly known as green-flowered meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, with small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, elongated spikes. Melica viridiflora is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
