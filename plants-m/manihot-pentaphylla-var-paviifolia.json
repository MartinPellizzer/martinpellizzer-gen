    "intro": "Manihot pentaphylla var. paviifolia, commonly known as the white arrowleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically white or pale green in color, which distinguishes it from other species in the Manihot genus. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland areas. Its unique leaf morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies."
