    "intro": "Menyanthes, commonly known as bog myrtle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in waterlogged soil. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are broad and oval, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant is noted for its aromatic, slightly resinous scent, which comes from compounds in its foliage."
