    "intro": "Miyamayomena savatieri subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf miyamayomena, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
