It features square, slightly hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is closely related to other members of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and has a strong, minty scent. Water mint is often found near streams, wet meadows, and other damp environments."
