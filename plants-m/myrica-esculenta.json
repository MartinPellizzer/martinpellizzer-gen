    "intro": "Myrica esculenta, commonly known as the wax myrtle or bayberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its aromatic oils have been used historically for making candles and as a source of wax. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
