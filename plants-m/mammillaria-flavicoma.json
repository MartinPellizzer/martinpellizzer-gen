    "intro": "Mammillaria flavicoma, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white to yellowish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
