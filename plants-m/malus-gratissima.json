    "intro": "Malus gratissima, commonly known as the sweet crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, ornamental fruits and showy spring blossoms. The tree typically grows to a height of 6\u201312 meters, with a rounded canopy and peeling bark that becomes more distinct with age. Its flowers, which range from white to pink, attract pollinators, while its fruits are edible but often too tart for direct consumption. The plant is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in gardens for its ornamental qualities."
