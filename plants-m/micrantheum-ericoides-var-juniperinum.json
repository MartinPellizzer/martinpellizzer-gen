    "intro": "Micrantheum ericoides var. juniperinum, commonly known as the juniperleaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
