It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal areas due to its tolerance for salt and wind. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Melampodium bonairense is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance and hardy nature."
