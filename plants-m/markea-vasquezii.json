    "intro": "Markea vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's markea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with a compact form and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Markea vasquezii is considered a species of conservation concern."
