    "intro": "Montanoa triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed montanoa, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, with leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or mountainous regions. Montanoa triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
