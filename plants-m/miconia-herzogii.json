    "intro": "Miconia herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's miconia, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
