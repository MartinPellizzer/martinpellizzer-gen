    "intro": "Marsilea sericea, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, floating spores that aid in its reproduction. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its delicate, feathery fronds make it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and water gardens."
