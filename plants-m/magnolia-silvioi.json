    "intro": "Magnolia silvioi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre magnolia, is a rare and striking evergreen tree native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, providing a striking contrast. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
