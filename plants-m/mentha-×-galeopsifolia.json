    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 galeopsifolia, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The leaves emit a strong, aromatic scent when crushed, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been widely naturalized in other regions. This plant is often cultivated for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
