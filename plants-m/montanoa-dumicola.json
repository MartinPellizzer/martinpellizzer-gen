    "intro": "Montanoa dumicola, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Montanoa dumicola plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
