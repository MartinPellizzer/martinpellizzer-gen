    "intro": "Molinia spiculosa, commonly known as the slender moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to wet, acidic habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, moist environments such as bogs, fens, and heaths, where it forms dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Molinia spiculosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
