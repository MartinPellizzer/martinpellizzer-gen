    "intro": "Meoschium neesianum, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects. However, it can be detrimental to its host tree if left unchecked."
