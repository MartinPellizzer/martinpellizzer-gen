It is a small, mat-forming succulent characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, spiky leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
