    "intro": "Mastixia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf mastix, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in rainforests or along streamlines. Mastixia macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal flowering."
