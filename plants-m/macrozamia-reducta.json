    "intro": "Macrozamia reducta, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a slow-growing evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
