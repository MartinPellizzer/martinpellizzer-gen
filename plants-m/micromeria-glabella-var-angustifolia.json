    "intro": "Micromeria glabella var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
