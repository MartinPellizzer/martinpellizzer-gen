    "intro": "Microstylis montana, commonly known as the mountain microstylis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Native to mountainous regions, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
