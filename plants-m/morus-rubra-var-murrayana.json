    "intro": "Morus rubra var. murrayana, commonly known as the Murray mulberry, is a variant of the red mulberry native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark red to black bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and slightly lobed. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a purplish-black color, which are edible and often consumed by birds and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
