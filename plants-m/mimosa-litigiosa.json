    "intro": "Mimosa litigiosa, commonly known as the war plant, is a flowering shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
