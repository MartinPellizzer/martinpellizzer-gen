    "intro": "Melocactus onychacanthus var. conicus, commonly known as the cone-shaped melon cactus, is a distinctive species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem that forms a dense, spiny structure resembling a cone. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged exterior. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
