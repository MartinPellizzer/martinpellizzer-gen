    "intro": "Miltinea maulensis, commonly known as the Maul's milt, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Miltinea maulensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
