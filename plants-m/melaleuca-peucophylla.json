    "intro": "Melaleuca peucophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which appear in clusters. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments. Melaleuca peucophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
