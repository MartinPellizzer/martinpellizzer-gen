    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. genuina, commonly known as the white medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers that appear in late spring, followed by unique, fleshy fruits that ripen in autumn. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. This variety is closely related to the common medlar, but it differs in its smaller size and more delicate appearance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional herbal medicine."
