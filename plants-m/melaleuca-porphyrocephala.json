    "intro": "Melaleuca porphyrocephala, commonly known as the red-leaf melaleuca, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown foliage, which is often densely packed and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically during the winter months. Its bark is smooth and peels off in thin, papery layers, revealing a reddish inner layer. Melaleuca porphyrocephala is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
