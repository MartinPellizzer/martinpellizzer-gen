    "intro": "Mormodes romanii, commonly known as the Romanii orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its roots are specialized for absorbing water and nutrients, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months of the year."
