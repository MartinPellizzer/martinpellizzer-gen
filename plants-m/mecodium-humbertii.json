    "intro": "Mecodium humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's mecodium, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red, often attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and certain species of bees. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mecodium humbertii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
