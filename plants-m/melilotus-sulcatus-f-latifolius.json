    "intro": "Melilotus sulcatus f. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved melilot, is a variant of the yellow sweet clover. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other melilot species due to its broader foliage and specific floral morphology."
