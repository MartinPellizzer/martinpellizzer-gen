    "intro": "Myrsine stolonifera var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese myrsine, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats."
