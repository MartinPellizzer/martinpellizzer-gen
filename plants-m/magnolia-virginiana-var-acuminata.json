    "intro": "Magnolia virginiana var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweetbay magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a distinctive white, waxy bloom. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a faintly aromatic scent when rubbed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
