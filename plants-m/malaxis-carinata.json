    "intro": "Malaxis carinata, commonly known as the ridge orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. Malaxis carinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
