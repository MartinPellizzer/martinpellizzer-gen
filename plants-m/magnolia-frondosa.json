    "intro": "Magnolia frondosa, commonly known as the fronded magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, ovate, leathery leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a rough texture that becomes more fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
