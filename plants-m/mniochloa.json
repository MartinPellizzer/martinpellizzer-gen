    "intro": "Mniochloa, commonly known as the rock lettuce, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Mniochloa species are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. They are well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help them survive in harsh environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
