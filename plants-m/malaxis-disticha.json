It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The orchid's pollination is primarily carried out by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitats."
