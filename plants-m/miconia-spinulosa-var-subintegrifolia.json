    "intro": "Miconia spinulosa var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments make it a notable species in tropical ecosystems. However, it can also be invasive in certain areas, posing challenges to native plant communities."
