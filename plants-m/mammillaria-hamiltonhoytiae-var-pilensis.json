    "intro": "Mammillaria hamiltonhoytiae var. pilensis, commonly known as the Pilentis mammillaria, is a rare and compact cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems with white to pale blue spines and dense, woolly areoles. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized collections and requires careful care to thrive."
