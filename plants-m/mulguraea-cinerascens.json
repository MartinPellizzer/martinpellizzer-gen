    "intro": "Mulguraea cinerascens, commonly known as the white mulga, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its grey-green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically during spring. Its woody structure and ability to withstand drought make it well adapted to harsh environments. The bark is often flaky and can peel in strips, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
