    "intro": "Medicago granadensis, commonly known as Granada clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Medicago granadensis is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
