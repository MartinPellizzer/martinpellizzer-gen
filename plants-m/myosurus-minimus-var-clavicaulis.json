    "intro": "Myosurus minimus var. clavicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mouse-ear, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tiny, ovate leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
