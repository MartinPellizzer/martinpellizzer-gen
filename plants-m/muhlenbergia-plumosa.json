    "intro": "Muhlenbergia plumosa, commonly known as the plume grass, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery plumes that give it a soft, flowing appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and woodland edges. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Muhlenbergia plumosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
