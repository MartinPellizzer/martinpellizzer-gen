It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, woolly fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
