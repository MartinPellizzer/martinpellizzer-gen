    "intro": "Miconia longicollis, commonly known as the long-necked miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia longicollis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
