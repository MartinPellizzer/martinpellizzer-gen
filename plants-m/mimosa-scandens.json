    "intro": "Mimosa scandens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Mimosa scandens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It also has a shallow root system, making it suitable for erosion control in certain environments."
