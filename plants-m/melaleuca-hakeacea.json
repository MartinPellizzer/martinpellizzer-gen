    "intro": "Melaleuca hakeacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous layer beneath, and its small, aromatic leaves. It produces white or pale yellow flowers in spikes, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Melaleuca hakeacea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
