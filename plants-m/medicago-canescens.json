    "intro": "Medicago canescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by slender, curved pods containing several seeds. It is widely used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Medicago canescens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
