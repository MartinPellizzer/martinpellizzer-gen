    "intro": "Melandrium apetalum subsp. arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic catchfly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, inconspicuous flowers that are often reduced or absent, giving it its scientific name \"apetalum,\" meaning \"without petals.\" The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It produces tiny, reddish seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in nutrient-poor soils and low temperatures."
