    "intro": "Malva rhizantha, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Malva rhizantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
