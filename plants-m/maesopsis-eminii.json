    "intro": "Maesopsis eminii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as a vulnerable species in some regions."
