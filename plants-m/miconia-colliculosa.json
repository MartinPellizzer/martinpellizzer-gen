    "intro": "Miconia colliculosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries. Miconia colliculosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
