    "intro": "Mitracarpus glabrescens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable ornamental and ecological plant in desert landscapes."
