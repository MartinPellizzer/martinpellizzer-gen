    "intro": "Meioperis suberosa, commonly known as the thick-leaved cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its robust, woody trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain water in its arid native environment. Meioperis suberosa is a slow-growing plant that plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
