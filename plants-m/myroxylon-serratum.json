    "intro": "Myroxylon serratum, commonly known as the Copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is valued for its aromatic resin, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. The plant has a dense, buttressed root system and can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-like canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. The tree plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna."
