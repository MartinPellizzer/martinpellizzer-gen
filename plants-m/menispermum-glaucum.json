    "intro": "Menispermum glaucum, commonly known as the blue false hellebore, is a deciduous climbing plant native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with a bluish-gray underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its toxic nature requires caution when handling, as all parts of the plant contain harmful compounds."
