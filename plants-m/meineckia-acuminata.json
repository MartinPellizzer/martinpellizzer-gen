    "intro": "Meineckia acuminata, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Meineckia acuminata is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
