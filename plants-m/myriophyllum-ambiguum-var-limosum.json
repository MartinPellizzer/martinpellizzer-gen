    "intro": "Myriophyllum ambiguum var. limosum, commonly known as narrowleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, arranged in whorls along its stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that emerge from the water surface in late summer. It thrives in freshwater lakes and ponds with moderate to slow water flow. Its rapid growth can lead to dense underwater vegetation, impacting water quality and native plant communities."
