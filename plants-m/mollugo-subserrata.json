    "intro": "Mollugo subserrata, commonly known as the saw-toothed sandpant, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and disturbed soils in the southeastern United States. It has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have serrated edges, contributing to its common name. Small yellow flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to thrive in arid conditions and is often found in coastal dunes and open fields."
