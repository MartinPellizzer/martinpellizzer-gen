    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris subsp. lavandulacea, commonly known as woodland mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its distinct minty fragrance. This subspecies is often confused with other Mentha species due to its similar appearance and scent."
