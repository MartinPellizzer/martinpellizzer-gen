It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. The variety is known for its hardiness and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
