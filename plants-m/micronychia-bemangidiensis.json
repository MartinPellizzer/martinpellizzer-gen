It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, adhering tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant organism."
