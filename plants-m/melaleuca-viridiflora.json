    "intro": "Melaleuca viridiflora, commonly known as the greenflower paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a papery texture, and its lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to autumn. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Melaleuca viridiflora is also known for its ability to tolerate coastal environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
