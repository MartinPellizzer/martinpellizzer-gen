    "intro": "Miconia onaensis, commonly known as the Ona miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the islands of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
