    "intro": "Mendoncella, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and produces a milky sap that can be toxic. Mendoncella plays an important role in supporting native wildlife, particularly the larvae of the monarch butterfly."
