It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, and it produces aerial roots that help in absorbing moisture from the air. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
