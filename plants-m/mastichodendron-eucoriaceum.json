    "intro": "Mastichodendron eucoriaceum, commonly known as the African mastichodendron, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces a resin that has been historically valued for its aromatic and medicinal properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
