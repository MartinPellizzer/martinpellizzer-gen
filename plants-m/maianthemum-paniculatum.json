    "intro": "Maianthemum paniculatum, commonly known as the fragrant cowslip, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Convallariaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces berries that are red when ripe, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The species is often found in association with other shade-tolerant plants in the understory of forests."
