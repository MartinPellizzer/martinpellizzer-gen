    "intro": "Morelodendron, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Morelodendron is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
