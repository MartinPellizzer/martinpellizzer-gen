    "intro": "Melica cretica var. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae crested grass, is a variant of the crested grass species native to certain regions of southern Europe. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant within its native range."
