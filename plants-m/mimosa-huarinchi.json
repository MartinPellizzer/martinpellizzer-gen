    "intro": "Mimosa huarinchi, commonly known as the Andean sensitive plant, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch and light, a trait known as thigmonastic response, which helps protect the plant from herbivores. Mimosa huarinchi is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
