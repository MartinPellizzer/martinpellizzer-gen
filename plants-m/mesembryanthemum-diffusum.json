It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
