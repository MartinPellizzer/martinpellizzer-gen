    "intro": "Micromeria insularis, commonly known as the island micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, adapting to the unique environmental conditions of its island home. It is a shrub that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, with hairy stems and clustered inflorescences. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
