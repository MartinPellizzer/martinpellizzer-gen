    "intro": "Macaranga adenantha, commonly known as the white-flowered macaranga, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a fast-growing shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Macaranga adenantha is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food."
