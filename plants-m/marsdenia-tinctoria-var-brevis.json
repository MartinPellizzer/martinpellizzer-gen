It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thin, woody stems and opposite, elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its latex contains compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine and dyeing processes. The varietal form 'brevis' distinguishes it from other varieties by its shorter stem length and compact growth habit."
