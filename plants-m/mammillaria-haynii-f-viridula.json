    "intro": "Mammillaria haynii f. viridula, commonly known as the green mammillaria, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with a smooth, greenish-gray surface that lacks the typical white spines of other Mammillaria species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and compact form, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
