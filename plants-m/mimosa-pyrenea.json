    "intro": "Mimosa pyrenea, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or garden settings. Mimosa pyrenea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in certain ecological contexts."
