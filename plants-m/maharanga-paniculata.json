    "intro": "Maharanga paniculata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
