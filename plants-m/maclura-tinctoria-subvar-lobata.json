    "intro": "Maclura tinctoria subvar. lobata, commonly known as the yellow wood or honeylocust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types, making it a resilient species in woodland and disturbed habitats. Its historical use in dyeing textiles and its ornamental value contribute to its ecological and cultural significance."
