    "intro": "Megalachne robinsoniana, commonly known as the Florida beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along dunes and tidal flats. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Megalachne robinsoniana plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
