    "intro": "Metteniusa, commonly known as the silky tree or silkwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their smooth, often greyish bark and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate or pinnate. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale in color, and their fruit is a legume containing several seeds. Metteniusa species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or for their use in traditional medicine."
