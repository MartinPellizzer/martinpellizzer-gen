It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. Mimosa pseudolepidota thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
