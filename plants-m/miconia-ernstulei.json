    "intro": "Miconia ernstulei, commonly known as the purple miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
