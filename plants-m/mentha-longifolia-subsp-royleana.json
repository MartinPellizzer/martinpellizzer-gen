It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in terminal spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties. The subspecies is closely related to other mint species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences."
