    "intro": "Mimosa elliptica, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa elliptica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
