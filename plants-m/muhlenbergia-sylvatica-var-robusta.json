    "intro": "Muhlenbergia sylvatica var. robusta, commonly known as the woodland muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often visible in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in natural habitats."
