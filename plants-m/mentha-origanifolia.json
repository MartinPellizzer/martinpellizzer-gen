    "intro": "Mentha origanifolia, commonly known as lemon mint, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves emit a strong, lemony scent when crushed, due to the presence of high concentrations of menthone and other volatile oils. Mentha origanifolia is often used in herbal teas and culinary applications for its refreshing flavor and aromatic properties."
