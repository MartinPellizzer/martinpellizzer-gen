    "intro": "Mikania infesta, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its rapid spread. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
