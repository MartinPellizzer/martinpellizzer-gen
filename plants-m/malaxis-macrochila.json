    "intro": "Malaxis macrochila, commonly known as the giant malaxis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often mistaken for leaves due to their shape. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Malaxis macrochila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, moist environments."
