    "intro": "Marcetia tetrasticha, commonly known as the four-stemmed marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in South America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, often hairy stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils, and its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette at the base. It produces capsules as fruits, containing numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Marcetia tetrasticha is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
