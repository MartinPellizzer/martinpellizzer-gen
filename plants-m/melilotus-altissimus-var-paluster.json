It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinct yellowish-green color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and fields. Its medicinal and historical uses have made it a notable species in both traditional and modern botanical studies."
