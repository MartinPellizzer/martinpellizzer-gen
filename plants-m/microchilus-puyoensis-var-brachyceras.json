    "intro": "Microchilus puyoensis var. brachyceras, commonly known as the Puyo microchilus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form. The plant produces small, urn-shaped inflorescences that bear showy, violet-colored flowers. Its leaves are typically short and stiff, adapted to the humid, high-altitude environments where it thrives. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
