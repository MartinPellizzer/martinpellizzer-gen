    "intro": "Miconia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiky, red-orange fruits. Miconia macrophylla is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is known for its rapid growth rate. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions outside its native range."
