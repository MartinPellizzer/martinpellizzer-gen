    "intro": "Minuartia dianthifolia subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers with four petals, typical of the Brassicaceae family. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments. This subspecies is often found in limestone or rocky habitats, showcasing its resilience to arid and nutrient-poor conditions."
