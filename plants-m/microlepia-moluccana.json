    "intro": "Microlepia moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, though this trait is more pronounced in certain cultivars."
