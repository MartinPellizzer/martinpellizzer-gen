It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces intricate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
