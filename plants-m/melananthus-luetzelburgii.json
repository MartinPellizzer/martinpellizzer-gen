    "intro": "Melananthus luetzelburgii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and extensive root system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it plays a significant ecological role in its native environment."
