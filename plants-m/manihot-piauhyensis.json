    "intro": "Manihot piauhyensis, commonly known as the Piauhyena or Piauhyena tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense canopy of lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, starchy tuberous roots. The species is valued for its potential agricultural and medicinal uses, though it remains relatively understudied compared to other manioc relatives."
