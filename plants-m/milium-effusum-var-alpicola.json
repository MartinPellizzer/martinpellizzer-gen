    "intro": "Milium effusum var. alpicola, commonly known as alpine millet, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms part of the alpine vegetation community. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
