    "intro": "Micrampelis rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's climbing plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. It is a scrambling shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowering period typically occurs during the rainy season, and it is often found growing along forest floors or on tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Micrampelis rusbyi is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
