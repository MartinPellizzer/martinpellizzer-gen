    "intro": "Mimosa chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in spring and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. Mimosa chiapensis is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
