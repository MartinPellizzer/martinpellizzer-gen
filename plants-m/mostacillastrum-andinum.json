    "intro": "Mostacillastrum andinum, commonly known as the Andean grass or Andean wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blade-like leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
