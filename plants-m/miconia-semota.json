    "intro": "Miconia semota, commonly known as the white miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
