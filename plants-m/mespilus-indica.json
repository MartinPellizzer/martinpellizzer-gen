    "intro": "Mespilus indica, commonly known as the common medlar, is a small deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested when they are partially ripe, as they continue to soften and develop a sweet flavor after picking. The plant has smooth, grayish-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are pale green and appear in clusters, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The medlar is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
