    "intro": "Maurocenia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf maurocenia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be ovate, elliptic, or even linear depending on environmental conditions. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
