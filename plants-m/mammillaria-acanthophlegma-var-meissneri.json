    "intro": "Mammillaria acanthophlegma var. meissneri, commonly known as the Meissner's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. The plant features short, cylindrical stems with areoles that bear clusters of stiff, white spines. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
