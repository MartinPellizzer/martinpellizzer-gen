    "intro": "Miconia stephanotricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
