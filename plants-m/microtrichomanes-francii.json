    "intro": "Microtrichomanes francii, commonly known as the French microtrichomanes, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in minute, hair-like structures called trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
