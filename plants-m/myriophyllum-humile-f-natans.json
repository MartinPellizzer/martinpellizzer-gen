    "intro": "Myriophyllum humile f. natans, commonly known as watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems. It has slender, branching stems that are often covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow streams. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
