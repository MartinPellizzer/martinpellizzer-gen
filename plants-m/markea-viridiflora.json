    "intro": "Markea viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered markea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking emerald-green petals that contrast with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Markea viridiflora is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties."
