    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. suffusa, commonly known as the Siberian apple or a variant of the wild apple, is a botanical form native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, often dwarfed growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically white or pink, and the fruit is a small, tart apple with a thick skin. This form is considered a progenitor of many cultivated apple varieties due to its genetic diversity. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
