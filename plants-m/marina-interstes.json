    "intro": "Marina interstes, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a hardy plant that thrives in saline and coastal environments. It features narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. Marina interstes plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
