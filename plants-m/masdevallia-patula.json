It features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Masdevallia patula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure."
