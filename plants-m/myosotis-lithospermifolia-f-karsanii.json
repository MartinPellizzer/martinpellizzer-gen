    "intro": "Myosotis lithospermifolia f. karsanii, commonly known as the Karsanii Forget-me-not, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, sky-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
