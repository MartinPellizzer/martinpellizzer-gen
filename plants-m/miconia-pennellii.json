    "intro": "Miconia pennellii, commonly known as the Florida miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia pennellii is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
