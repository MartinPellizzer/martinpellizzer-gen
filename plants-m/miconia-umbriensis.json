    "intro": "Miconia umbriensis, commonly known as the Umbrian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often deeply veined and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
