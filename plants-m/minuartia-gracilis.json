    "intro": "Minuartia gracilis, commonly known as the slender sand-rose, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, exhibiting a unique ability to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Minuartia gracilis is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
