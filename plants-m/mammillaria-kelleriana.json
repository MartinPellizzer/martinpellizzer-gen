    "intro": "Mammillaria kelleriana, commonly known as the Keller's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with white, woolly spines and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its compact size and unique appearance. Mammillaria kelleriana prefers well-draining soil and bright, indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
