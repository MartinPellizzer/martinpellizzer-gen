    "intro": "Medicago villosa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods containing several elliptical seeds, which are typically brown to black in color. Hairy vetch is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climates."
