    "intro": "Myrica verrucosa, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Myrica verrucosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has a long history of use by Native American tribes for medicinal and practical purposes."
