    "intro": "Myosotis saxosa, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that thrives in alpine and rocky habitats, often growing at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, adding vibrant color to its natural environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Myosotis saxosa is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in alpine ecosystems."
