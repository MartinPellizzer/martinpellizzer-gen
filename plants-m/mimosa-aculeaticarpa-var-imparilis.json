    "intro": "Mimosa aculeaticarpa var. imparilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
