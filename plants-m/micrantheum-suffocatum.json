    "intro": "Micrantheum suffocatum, commonly known as the suffocating mountain-mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. These flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its common name reflects its ability to form dense stands that can outcompete other vegetation, leading to its reputation as a potentially invasive species in certain areas."
