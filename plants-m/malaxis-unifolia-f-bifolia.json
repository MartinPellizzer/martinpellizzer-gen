    "intro": "Malaxis unifolia f. bifolia, commonly known as the bifoliate malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two prominent, showy sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
