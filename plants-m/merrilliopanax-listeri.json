    "intro": "Merrilliopanax listeri, commonly known as the Lister's ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Merrilliopanax listeri is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
