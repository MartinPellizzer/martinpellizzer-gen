    "intro": "Morus cuspidata, commonly known as the Japanese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green on the upper surface and pale white underneath. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fibers, which are used in silk production. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide shade."
