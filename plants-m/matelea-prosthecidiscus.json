    "intro": "Matelea prosthecidiscus, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, and the stems are woody and branched. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native habitat."
