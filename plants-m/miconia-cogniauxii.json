    "intro": "Miconia cogniauxii, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red berry containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
