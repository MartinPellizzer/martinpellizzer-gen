    "intro": "Micromeria linkii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has small, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Micromeria linkii is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
