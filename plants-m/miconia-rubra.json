    "intro": "Miconia rubra, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, red flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by dark, velvety fruits. Miconia rubra is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native environments."
