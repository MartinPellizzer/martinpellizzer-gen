    "intro": "Montia spathulata var. viridis, commonly known as green spoonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features succulent, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically bright green, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
