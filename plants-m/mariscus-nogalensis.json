    "intro": "Mariscus nogalensis, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the rocky landscapes of northern Mexico. It features a compact, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help minimize transpiration. Mariscus nogalensis is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species for xerophytic gardens."
