    "intro": "Meriania franciscana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Meriania franciscana is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty and potential medicinal properties."
