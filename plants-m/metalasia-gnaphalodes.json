    "intro": "Metalasia gnaphalodes, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and also covered in a fine silvery coating, contributing to its ornamental value. Metalasia gnaphalodes is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
