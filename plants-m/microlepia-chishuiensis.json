    "intro": "Microlepia chishuiensis, commonly known as the Chishui microlepia, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its rhizomes are short and thick, supporting the growth of its bipinnate leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
