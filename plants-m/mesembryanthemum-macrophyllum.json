    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum macrophyllum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and vibrant blooms make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
