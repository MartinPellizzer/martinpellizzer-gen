    "intro": "Magnolia carnosa, commonly known as the thick-leaved magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early spring before the leaves appear. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture. Magnolia carnosa thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil."
