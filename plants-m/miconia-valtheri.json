    "intro": "Miconia valtheri, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by bright orange, star-shaped fruits. Miconia valtheri is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
