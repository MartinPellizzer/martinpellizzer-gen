    "intro": "Myrtus shepherdii, commonly known as the desert myrtle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, a small, leathery berry, contains seeds that are dispersed by birds. Myrtus shepherdii is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
