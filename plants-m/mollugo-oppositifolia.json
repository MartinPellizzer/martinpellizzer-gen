    "intro": "Mollugo oppositifolia, commonly known as common pearlwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and disturbed habitats. Mollugo oppositifolia is often found in coastal areas, lawns, and along roadsides."
