    "intro": "Myrica rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, waxy, cone-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica rotundata is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
