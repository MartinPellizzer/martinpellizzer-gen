    "intro": "Marattia rolandii-principis, commonly known as the Prince's fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the Marattiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a distinctive, palmately divided structure. The plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its spores are produced in large, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are released during specific environmental conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
