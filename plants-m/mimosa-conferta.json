    "intro": "Mimosa conferta, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Mimosa conferta is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
