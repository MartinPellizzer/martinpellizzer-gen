    "intro": "Mikania fragilis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, sunny environments. Mikania fragilis is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields due to its aggressive growth habit."
