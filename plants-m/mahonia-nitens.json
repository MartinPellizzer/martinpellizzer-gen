    "intro": "Mahonia nitens, commonly known as the evergreen mahonia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and evergreen leaves that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Mahonia nitens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and temperate gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest and adaptability to various growing conditions."
