    "intro": "Melinis minutiflora var. effusa, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form a thick mat, making it an effective ground cover. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
