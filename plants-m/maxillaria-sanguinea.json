It is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
