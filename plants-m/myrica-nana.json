It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, wax-like leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. Myrica nana thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetland or bog environments. It plays a role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
