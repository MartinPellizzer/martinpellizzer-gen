    "intro": "Mitracarpus rhadinophyllus, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces clusters of yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that splits open to release its seeds. This species is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a hardy plant in dry, sun-exposed environments."
