    "intro": "Microlepia subpinnata, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Microlepia subpinnata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
