    "intro": "Myriocarpa dombeyana, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Myriocarpa dombeyana is often found in rocky areas and is a symbol of resilience in harsh desert conditions."
