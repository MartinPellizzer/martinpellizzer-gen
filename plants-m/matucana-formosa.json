    "intro": "Matucana formosa, commonly known as the golden torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in bright yellow spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor collections."
