    "intro": "Manulea linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved manulea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species."
