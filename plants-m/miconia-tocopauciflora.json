    "intro": "Miconia tocopauciflora, commonly known as the Tocopauci miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly in Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
