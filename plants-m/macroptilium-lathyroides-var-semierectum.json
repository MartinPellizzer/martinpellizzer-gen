    "intro": "Macroptilium lathyroides var. semierectum, commonly known as the semi-erect lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its semi-upright growth habit, with stems that are somewhat woody at the base and branching towards the top. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly heart-shaped base. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and its adaptability to various soil conditions."
