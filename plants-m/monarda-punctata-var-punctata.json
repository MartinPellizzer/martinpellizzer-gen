    "intro": "Monarda punctata var. punctata, commonly known as spotted beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive white or pale yellow spot at the base of each petal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. This species is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
