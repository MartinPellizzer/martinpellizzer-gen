    "intro": "Moorea araucana, commonly known as the Mo\u02bborea Araucaria, is a unique coniferous tree native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feathery foliage. The tree produces distinctive cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority."
