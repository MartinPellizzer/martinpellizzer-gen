    "intro": "Melampodium strigosum, commonly known as the hairy goldenweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in a dense layer of hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Melampodium strigosum is often found in dry, open areas such as roadsides and disturbed soils."
