    "intro": "Medicago dentata, commonly known as the arrowleaf clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Medicago dentata is also valued as a forage crop and for its ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
