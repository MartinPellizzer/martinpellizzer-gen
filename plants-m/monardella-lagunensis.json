    "intro": "Monardella lagunensis, commonly known as the San Francisco fiddleneck, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. It produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to the harsh coastal climate with its drought-resistant properties. Monardella lagunensis is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
