    "intro": "Martiusia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved martiusia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
