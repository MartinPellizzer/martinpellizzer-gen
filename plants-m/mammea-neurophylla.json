    "intro": "Mammea neurophylla, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense, prop roots that help stabilize coastal soils. The plant has dark red bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release buoyant seeds for dispersal in water. Mammea neurophylla plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial life."
