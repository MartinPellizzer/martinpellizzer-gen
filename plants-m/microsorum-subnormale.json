    "intro": "Microsorum subnormale, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Java fern, is a hardy aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern along its rhizome. The plant thrives in freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums due to its low maintenance requirements. Its rhizome can anchor to substrates, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Microsorum subnormale is valued for its ability to provide shelter for aquatic life and enhance the aesthetic appeal of planted tanks."
