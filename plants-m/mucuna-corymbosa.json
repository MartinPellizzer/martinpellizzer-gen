    "intro": "Mucuna corymbosa, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural settings. However, its seeds contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
