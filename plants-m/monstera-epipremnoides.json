    "intro": "Monstera epipremnoides, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop fenestrations, or holes, as they mature. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its stems can grow quite long, often requiring support such as a trellis or moss pole. It is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
