    "intro": "Melaleuca laurina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spikes, which are typically borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Melaleuca laurina is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils."
