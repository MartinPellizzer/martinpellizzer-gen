    "intro": "Myrcia duriuscula, commonly known as the Brazilian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrcia duriuscula thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native habitat."
