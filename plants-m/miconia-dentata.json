    "intro": "Miconia dentata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia dentata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
