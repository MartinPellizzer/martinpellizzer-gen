    "intro": "Malesherbia lirana var. atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama malesherbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, which bloom during the brief rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, exhibiting a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
