    "intro": "Marsilea mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water clover, is a aquatic fern native to Central America. It has small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged fronds that aid in photosynthesis. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
