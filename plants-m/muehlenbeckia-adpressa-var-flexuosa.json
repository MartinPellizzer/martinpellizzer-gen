    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia adpressa var. flexuosa, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
