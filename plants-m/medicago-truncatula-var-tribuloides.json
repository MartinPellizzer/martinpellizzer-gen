    "intro": "Medicago truncatula var. tribuloides, commonly known as narrowleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is a nitrogen-fixing species, making it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant. Its compact growth habit and adaptability make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
