    "intro": "Mitranthes pedicellata, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Mitranthes pedicellata is often found in open habitats like grasslands and along riverbanks."
