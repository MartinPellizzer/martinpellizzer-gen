    "intro": "Mimosa recordii, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Mimosa recordii is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
