    "intro": "Maytenus austroyunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan mayten, is a small evergreen tree native to southwestern China. It belongs to the family Phyllanthaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
