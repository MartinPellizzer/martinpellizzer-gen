    "intro": "Mikania ranunculifolia, commonly known as the smallleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Mikania ranunculifolia is often found in moist, open areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
