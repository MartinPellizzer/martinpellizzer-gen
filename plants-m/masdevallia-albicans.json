It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which are often adorned with subtle pink or purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a rare and elegant beauty to the orchid family.
