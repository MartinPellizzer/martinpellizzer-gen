    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. leptophylla, commonly known as slender-leaf mint, is a variant of the mint family (Lamiaceae) characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it useful in culinary and medicinal applications. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other mint varieties due to its specific growing requirements."
