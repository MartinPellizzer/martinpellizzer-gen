It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
