    "intro": "Maba mayombensis, commonly known as the African maba tree, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to forest biodiversity."
