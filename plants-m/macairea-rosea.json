The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
