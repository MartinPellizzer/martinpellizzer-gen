It is a perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its leaves. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water landscapes."
