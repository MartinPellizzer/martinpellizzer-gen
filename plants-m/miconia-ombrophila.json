    "intro": "Miconia ombrophila, commonly known as the rainforest miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia ombrophila plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
