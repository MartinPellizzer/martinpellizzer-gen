    "intro": "Mayepea axillaris, commonly known as the creeping mayepea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mayepea axillaris is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
