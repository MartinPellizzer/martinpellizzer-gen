    "intro": "Maximiliana attaleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by distinctive, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
