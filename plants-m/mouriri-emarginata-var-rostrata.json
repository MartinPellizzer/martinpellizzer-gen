    "intro": "Mouriri emarginata var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated mouriri, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated calyx that resembles a beak, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
