    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rigoi, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent plants, Mentha spicata and Mentha viridis. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, featuring square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its aromatic leaves contain high concentrations of nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its characteristic fragrance and effects on cats. Mentha \u00d7 rigoi is widely cultivated for its medicinal properties, culinary uses, and as a natural attractant for pollinators."
