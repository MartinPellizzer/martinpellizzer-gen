    "intro": "Mabea argutissima, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a spicy taste. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and can grow up to 10 meters tall. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
