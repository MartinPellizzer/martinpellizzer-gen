    "intro": "Myrcia linkiana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant features dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small, red, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the dispersal of the species by birds."
