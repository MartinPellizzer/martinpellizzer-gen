It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly notable for their flavor. Metastelma glaberrimum is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
