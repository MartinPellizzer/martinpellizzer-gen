    "intro": "Malveopsis pichinchensis var. decolorans, commonly known as the decoloring malveopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, often pink or red flowers. The varietal name \"decolorans\" refers to its unique trait of losing color in its petals under certain environmental conditions. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and has hairy stems and leaves. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
