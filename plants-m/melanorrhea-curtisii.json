    "intro": "Melanorrhea curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, wiry stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in several countries."
