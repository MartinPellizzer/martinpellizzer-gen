    "intro": "Myrsine cacuminum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in coastal areas, particularly in brackish or saline environments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Myrsine cacuminum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
