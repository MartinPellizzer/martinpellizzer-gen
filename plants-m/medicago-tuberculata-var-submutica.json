    "intro": "Medicago tuberculata var. submutica, commonly known as the woolly medick, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, upright inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. Its hairy foliage and compact growth make it a distinctive and recognizable species within the legume family."
