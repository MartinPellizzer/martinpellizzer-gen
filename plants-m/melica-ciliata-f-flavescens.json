    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-fringed milletgrass, is a botanical variant of the species Melica ciliata. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with a distinctive yellowish hue. This form is notable for its fine, silky hairs along the leaf margins, which give it a soft, delicate appearance. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows or along stream banks."
