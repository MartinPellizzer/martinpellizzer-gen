It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves. Its flowers are characterized by their three-lobed petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered."
