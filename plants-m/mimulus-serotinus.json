    "intro": "Mimulus serotinus, commonly known as the late yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its scientific name reflects its late blooming habit, as \"serotinus\" means \"late-blooming\" in Latin. The flowers are tubular with two lips, a characteristic feature of the Mimulus genus."
