    "intro": "Miconia hirtistyla, commonly known as the hairy-styled miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia hirtistyla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
