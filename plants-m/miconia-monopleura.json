    "intro": "Miconia monopleura, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a large, shrub-like species that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale green, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Miconia monopleura is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it an invasive species in some regions."
