    "intro": "Minuartia khorassanica, commonly known as the Khorasan rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, this species thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. The plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high sunlight exposure and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss."
