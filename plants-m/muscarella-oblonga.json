    "intro": "Muscarella oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf muscarine mushroom, is a species of psychoactive fungus belonging to the Amanita genus. It is characterized by its elongated, slender cap that is typically pale yellow to brown in color. The stem is slender and often has a bulbous base, and the gills are closely spaced and initially pale before darkening. It contains the hallucinogenic compound muscimol, which can be toxic in high doses. This mushroom is often found in forested areas, particularly in regions with moist, temperate climates."
