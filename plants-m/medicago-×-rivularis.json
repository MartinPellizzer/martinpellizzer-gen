    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 rivularis, commonly known as the river medic, is a hybrid legume species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Medicago sativa and Medicago polymorpha. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Medicago \u00d7 rivularis is also valued for forage and erosion control in agricultural settings."
