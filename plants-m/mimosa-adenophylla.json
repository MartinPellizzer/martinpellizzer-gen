    "intro": "Mimosa adenophylla, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Mimosa adenophylla is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
