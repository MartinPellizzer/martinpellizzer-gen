    "intro": "Miconia glyptophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It produces berries that are typically orange or red in color, containing numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
