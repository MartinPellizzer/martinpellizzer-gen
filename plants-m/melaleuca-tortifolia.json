    "intro": "Melaleuca tortifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a member of the Myrtaceae family native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive woody capsules. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets in wetland or swampy areas. Melaleuca tortifolia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
