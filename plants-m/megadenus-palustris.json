    "intro": "Megadenus palustris, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
