It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed capsules that split open when mature. Mocanera polysperma is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
