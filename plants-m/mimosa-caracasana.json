    "intro": "Mimosa caracasana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa caracasana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and responsive foliage."
