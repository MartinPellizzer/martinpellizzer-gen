    "intro": "Microsorum zosteriforme, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble a woven pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum zosteriforme is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
