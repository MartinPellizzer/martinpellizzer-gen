    "intro": "Mentha cordato-ovata, commonly known as the heart-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly toothed along the edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mentha cordato-ovata is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent and is often used in traditional medicine for its cooling properties. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes."
