    "intro": "Metastelma astephanoides, commonly known as the \"Bog Orchid,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and swampy areas. The plant has slender, branching stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
