    "intro": "Mostuea buchholzii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow iris, is a striking wetland plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in marshy or aquatic environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
