It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery underside, while the flowers are small and clustered in spikes. This species is adapted to salt-laden winds and is often found in areas with high humidity and moderate rainfall."
