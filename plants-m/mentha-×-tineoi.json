    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 tineoi, commonly known as hybrid mint, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) and watermint (Mentha aquatica). It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are not typically used for commercial harvesting due to its sterility. Mentha \u00d7 tineoi is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its aromatic properties in horticultural settings. Its cultivation is primarily for ornamental purposes and as a parent plant in breeding programs."
