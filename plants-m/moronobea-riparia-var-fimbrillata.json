    "intro": "Moronobea riparia var. fimbrillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf riverbean, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in wet, sandy soils along riverbanks and is adapted to flood-prone environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces slender, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
