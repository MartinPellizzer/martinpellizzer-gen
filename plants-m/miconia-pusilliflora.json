    "intro": "Miconia pusilliflora, commonly known as the small-flowered miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions."
