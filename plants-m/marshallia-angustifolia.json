    "intro": "Marshallia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and pink to red petals, which bloom from late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Marshallia angustifolia is often found in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides, and it serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators."
