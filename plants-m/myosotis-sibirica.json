It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the stems are slender and often branched. Myosotis sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
