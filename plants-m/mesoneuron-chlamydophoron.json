    "intro": "Mesoneuron chlamydophoron, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across moist soils through underground stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
