    "intro": "Myosotis echinosperma, commonly known as the spiny-seeded forget-me-not, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features delicate blue to violet flowers with a distinctive spiky seed capsule, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Myosotis echinosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and soil stability."
