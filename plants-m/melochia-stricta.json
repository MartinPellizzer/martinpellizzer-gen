    "intro": "Melochia stricta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or broadleaf morning glory, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the morning. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Melochia stricta is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some regions."
