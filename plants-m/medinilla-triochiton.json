    "intro": "Medinilla triochiton, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet leaf, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that give it its common name.

It is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings due to its preference for humid, warm climates."
