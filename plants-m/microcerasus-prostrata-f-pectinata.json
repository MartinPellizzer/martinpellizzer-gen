It features dense, silvery-white pubescent foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique texture and seasonal blooms."
