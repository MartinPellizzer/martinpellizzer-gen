    "intro": "Myristica oblongifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf nutmeg tree, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring lanceolate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its seeds, known as nutmegs, are rich in essential oils and have been used historically for their medicinal and culinary properties. The tree also produces a resin that is similar to true nutmeg, contributing to its economic and botanical significance."
