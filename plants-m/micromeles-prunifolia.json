    "intro": "Micromeles prunifolia, commonly known as the cherryleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Micromeles prunifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
