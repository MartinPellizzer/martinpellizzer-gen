    "intro": "Miconia mituana, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, red berries. Miconia mituana is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
