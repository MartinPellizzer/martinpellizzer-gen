    "intro": "Myrsine dasyphylla, commonly known as the glossy myrsine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The leaves are usually glossy, elliptical, and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Small, white or pale pink flowers are borne in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are attractive to birds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
