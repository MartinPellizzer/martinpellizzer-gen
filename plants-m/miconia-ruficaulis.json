    "intro": "Miconia ruficaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
