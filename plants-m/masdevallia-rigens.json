    "intro": "Masdevallia rigens, commonly known as the rigid masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its striking, often colorful inflorescences. The plant typically produces pendulous, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. Masdevallia rigens is prized by orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
