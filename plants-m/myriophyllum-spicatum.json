    "intro": "Myriophyllum spicatum, commonly known as watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. Watermilfoil can spread rapidly through both sexual reproduction and vegetative means, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its dense growth can alter aquatic ecosystems by reducing light penetration and affecting water quality."
