    "intro": "Miconia rennerae, commonly known as the Brazilian star apple, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically eaten raw or used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forest growth. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
