    "intro": "Macrosolen pseudopsilantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf macrolen, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features include a hollow stem and finely divided leaves that help it blend into its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
