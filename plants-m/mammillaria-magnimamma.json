    "intro": "Mammillaria magnimamma, commonly known as the giant mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
