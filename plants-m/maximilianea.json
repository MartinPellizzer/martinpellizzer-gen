It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. They typically grow in rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Maximilianea species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
