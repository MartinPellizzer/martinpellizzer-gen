It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Mullein is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies. Its common name derives from the Old English word \"mull,\" referring to its soft, fuzzy leaves."
