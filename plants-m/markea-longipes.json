    "intro": "Markea longipes, commonly known as the long-footed markea, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length, often cascading over rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Markea longipes is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
