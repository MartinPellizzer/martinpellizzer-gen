It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual element to gardens. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 2 to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The fruit, though small and not typically cultivated for eating, adds additional interest with its pale yellow color and unique shape."
