It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.
