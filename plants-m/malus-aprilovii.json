    "intro": "Malus aprilovii, commonly known as the April serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen in late summer, adding value to both wildlife and human consumption. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. Malus aprilovii is relatively easy to grow and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
