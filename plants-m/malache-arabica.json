    "intro": "Malache arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee tree, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds used to make coffee. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires a humid environment. Due to its limited natural range, it is primarily cultivated in specific regions for its valuable coffee beans."
