    "intro": "Mappa vedeliana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which are often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
