    "intro": "Melandrium pensylvanicum, commonly known as the Pennsylvania catchfly, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It has a taproot system and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. The Pennsylvania catchfly is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is generally considered a minor species in ecological studies."
