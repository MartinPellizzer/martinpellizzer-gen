    "intro": "Melastoma extinctorium, commonly known as the fire extinguisher plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant's common name is believed to be derived from its historical use in extinguishing fires, although this practice is not widely documented."
