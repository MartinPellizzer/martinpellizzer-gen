    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 peisonis, commonly known as black mint, is a hybrid mint species resulting from the cross between Mentha \u00d7 gracilis and Mentha \u00d7 piperita. It is characterized by its dark purple to black foliage, which distinguishes it from other mint varieties. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Mentha \u00d7 peisonis is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its aromatic and purported therapeutic properties."
