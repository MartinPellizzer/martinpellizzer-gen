    "intro": "Malleola, commonly known as the ankle bone, is not a plant but a bony prominence on the ankle. It is part of the human skeletal system, specifically located on the lower leg. The term \"malleola\" is derived from the Latin word for \"hammer,\" referring to its shape. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the ankle joint and supporting the foot. Due to its anatomical nature, it is not relevant to botanical studies."
