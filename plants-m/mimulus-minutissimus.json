    "intro": "Mimulus minutissimus, commonly known as the dwarf monkeyflower, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
