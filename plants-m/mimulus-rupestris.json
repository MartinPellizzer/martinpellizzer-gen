    "intro": "Mimulus rupestris, commonly known as the rock monkeyflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers, which bloom from spring to summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. Mimulus rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
