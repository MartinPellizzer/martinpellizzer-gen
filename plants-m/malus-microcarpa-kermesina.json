It is characterized by its small, red or yellow fruits that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
