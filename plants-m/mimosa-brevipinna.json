    "intro": "Mimosa brevipinna, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Due to its sensitive nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
