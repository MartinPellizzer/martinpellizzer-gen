    "intro": "Macrolearia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Macrolearia is often found in disturbed areas and can become invasive in certain regions."
