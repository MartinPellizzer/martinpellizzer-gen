    "intro": "Malaxis warmingii, commonly known as the Warming's lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizome and its dense, flowering spikes that produce small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky areas. It has a unique morphology with elongated, strap-like leaves and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
