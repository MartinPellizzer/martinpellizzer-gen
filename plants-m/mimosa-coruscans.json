    "intro": "Mimosa coruscans, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Mimosa coruscans is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and ecological restoration projects."
