    "intro": "Mariscus concinnus var. subcompositus, commonly known as the coastal marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in saline or brackish marshes, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it reproduces primarily through rhizomes. This variant is notable for its adaptability to coastal environments and its role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
