It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb."
