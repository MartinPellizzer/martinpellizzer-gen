It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and hairy stems, which are typical features of the Malvaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a common garden plant. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous seeds have historically been used in traditional medicine and textile production."
