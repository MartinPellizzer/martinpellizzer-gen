    "intro": "Mallotus repandus, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, red or black berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Mallotus repandus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
