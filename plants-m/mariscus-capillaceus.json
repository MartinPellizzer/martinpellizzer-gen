    "intro": "Mariscus capillaceus, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Mariscus capillaceus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
