    "intro": "Muhlenbergia berteroniana, commonly known as the desert muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in shades of green to brown. It is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and minimal water requirements. This grass is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
