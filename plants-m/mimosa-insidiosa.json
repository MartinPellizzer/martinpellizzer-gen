    "intro": "Mimosa insidiosa, commonly known as the insidious sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in warm, arid climates. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Mimosa insidiosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
