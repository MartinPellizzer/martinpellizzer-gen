    "intro": "Microlepia trichoclada, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the underside of the fronds. Microlepia trichoclada is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
