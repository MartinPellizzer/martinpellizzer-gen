It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pinkish woolly spines. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
