    "intro": "Maniltoa hollrungii, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn reddish-brown as they mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
