    "intro": "Miscanthus sinensis var. zebrinus, commonly known as the Zebra Grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to East Asia. It features tall, slender stems that produce feathery, silver-green plumes, which add a dramatic visual element to gardens. The plant is characterized by its variegated foliage, with alternating bands of green and white along the leaf blades, creating a zebra-like pattern. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for landscaping. This variety is often used in mixed borders or as a focal point in perennial gardens due to its architectural form and seasonal interest."
