    "intro": "Monsonia obcordata, commonly known as the Cape umbrella plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, obcordate (heart-shaped) leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both gardeners and botanists."
