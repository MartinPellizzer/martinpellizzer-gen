    "intro": "Mariscus umbellatus var. evolutior, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a spreading growth habit with rhizomatous stems that produce dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
