    "intro": "Miocarpus paludosa, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in South America. It is characterized by its herbaceous stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Miocarpus paludosa thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
