It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Ficus and Terminalia species. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its fruits are berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and potential medicinal properties."
