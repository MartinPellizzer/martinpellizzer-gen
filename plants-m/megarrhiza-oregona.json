    "intro": "Megarrhiza oregona, commonly known as the Oregon megarrhiza, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
