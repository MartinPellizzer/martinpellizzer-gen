The leaves are usually dark green with a smooth surface and often have a waxy coating. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. The plant is native to Central and South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
