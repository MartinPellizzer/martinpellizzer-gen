    "intro": "Medinilla speciosa, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or golden torch, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, often resembling tangerines. Medinilla speciosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and tropical gardens."
