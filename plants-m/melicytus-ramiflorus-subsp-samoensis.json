    "intro": "Melicytus ramiflorus subsp. samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees in the Pacific Islands. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are red, fleshy, and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. This subspecies is an important component of the ecological system in its native habitat, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing food for local fauna."
