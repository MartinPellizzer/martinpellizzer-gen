    "intro": "Macrosamanea amplissima, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a large, evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous trunk and broad, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces large, fragrant inflorescences that bear numerous small, yellow flowers, which are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
