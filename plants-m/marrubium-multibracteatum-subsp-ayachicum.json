    "intro": "Marrubium multibracteatum subsp. ayachicum, commonly known as the Ayachic mountain hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lanceolate with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
