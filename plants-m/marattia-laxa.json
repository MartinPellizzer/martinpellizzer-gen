    "intro": "Marattia laxa, commonly known as the slender moon-leaf, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across forest floors in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically green with a slightly curled appearance, and they produce spores on the underside of the pinnae. Marattia laxa is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticultural settings."
