It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value lies in its graceful foliage and subtle floral display."
