    "intro": "Mananthes acutangula, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to a variety of soil types, though it prefers moist environments. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The tree plays an important ecological role in riparian zones, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
