    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 komarovii var. fructifera, commonly known as the fruit-bearing goat's rue, is a hybrid legume species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Medicago \u00d7 komarovii var. fructifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
