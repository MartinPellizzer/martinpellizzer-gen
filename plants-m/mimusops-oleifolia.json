    "intro": "Mimusops oleifolia, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. The tree has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and oval in shape. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Mimusops oleifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental beauty in landscaping."
