    "intro": "Myrica sessilifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually 2\u20134 inches long and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, spherical berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streambanks. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its broader leaves and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
