    "intro": "Mastigostyla potosina, commonly known as the Potos\u00ed ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait that may help it avoid excessive heat and desiccation. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mastigostyla potosina is considered a vulnerable species."
