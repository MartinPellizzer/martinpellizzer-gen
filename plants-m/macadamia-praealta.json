    "intro": "Macadamia praealta, commonly known as the tall macadamia, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, with a broad, rounded crown and smooth, dark grey bark. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing one to three edible nuts. The nuts are encased in a hard shell and are rich in oil, making them a valuable crop in the region."
