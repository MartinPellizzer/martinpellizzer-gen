    "intro": "Mimulicalyx paludigenus, commonly known as the marsh mimulicalyx, is a rare flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Mimulicalyx paludigenus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
