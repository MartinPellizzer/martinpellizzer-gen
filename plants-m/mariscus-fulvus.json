    "intro": "Mariscus fulvus, commonly known as the golden marsh orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to wetland habitats in South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and abundant moisture. The plant features striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across moist soils in marshy environments. Mariscus fulvus plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
