    "intro": "Mollinedia pachysandra, commonly known as broadleaf pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover native to eastern North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Mollinedia pachysandra is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to tolerate moisture."
