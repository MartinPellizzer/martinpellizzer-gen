    "intro": "Miconia sandwithii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Miconia sandwithii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of Hawaiian forests, though it is considered a non-native species introduced to the region."
