    "intro": "Mitropsidium, commonly known as the rock pear, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of a single species, Mitropsidium kirkii, which is native to South Africa. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fruit that resembles a pear in shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Mitropsidium is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
