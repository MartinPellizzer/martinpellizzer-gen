It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, terrestrial growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
