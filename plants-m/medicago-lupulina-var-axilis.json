    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. axilis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which benefits soil fertility. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
