    "intro": "Mephitidia rhizophylla, commonly known as the rootleaf vine, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its specialized root system that forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its leaves are broad and flat, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in low-light environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as moths and beetles. It thrives in moist, shaded areas of tropical rainforests, where its rhizomes spread horizontally through the soil. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries."
