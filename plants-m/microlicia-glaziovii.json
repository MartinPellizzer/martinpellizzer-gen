    "intro": "Microlicia glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's microlicia, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
