    "intro": "Mitrocereus militaris, commonly known as the Military Cereus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Mitrocereus militaris is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
