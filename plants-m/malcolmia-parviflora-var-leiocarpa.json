    "intro": "Malcolmia parviflora var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils. The variety leiocarpa is distinguished by its white flowers, which contrast with the green foliage, making it a notable species in its native habitat."
