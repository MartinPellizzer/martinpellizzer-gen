    "intro": "Malus sieversii subsp. hissarica, commonly known as the Central Asian apple, is a wild apple species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits and is considered a genetic ancestor of many cultivated apple varieties. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas and has a compact, shrub-like form. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces white flowers in the spring. This subspecies is of significant interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding improved apple cultivars."
