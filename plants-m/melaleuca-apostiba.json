    "intro": "Melaleuca apostiba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are fragrant and attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Melaleuca apostiba is typically found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
