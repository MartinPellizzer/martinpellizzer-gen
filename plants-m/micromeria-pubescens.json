    "intro": "Micromeria pubescens, commonly known as the hairy micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Micromeria pubescens is often found in scrublands and chaparral habitats, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role."
