    "intro": "Micranthes texana, commonly known as Texas micranthus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
