It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus with a distinctive, wrinkled surface that resembles crepe paper. The plant typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal forests. Its color ranges from pale yellow to greenish-gray, depending on environmental conditions. Malacothrix crepoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
