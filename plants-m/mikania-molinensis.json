    "intro": "Mikania molinensis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rapid growth and slender, climbing stems that can spread over large areas. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming throughout the growing season. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small capsules that release tiny seeds. Mikania molinensis is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habits."
