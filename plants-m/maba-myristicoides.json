    "intro": "Maba myristicoides, commonly known as the African nutmeg tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces oval-shaped fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a thick, aromatic aril. The plant is valued for its aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to nutmeg. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts within its native range."
