    "intro": "Markea formicarum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its ability to secrete a sugary substance that attracts ants, which in turn provide protection against herbivores. The plant's structure includes specialized leaf modifications called domatia, which serve as shelters for the ants. Its botanical features include opposite, ovate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Markea formicarum exhibits a mutualistic relationship with ants, making it an interesting subject in ecological studies."
