    "intro": "Mimosa polychaeta, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Mimosa polychaeta is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility."
