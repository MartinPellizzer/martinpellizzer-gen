    "intro": "Myrcia lascada, commonly known as Brazilian peppercorn, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dark, peppery fruits that resemble black peppercorns. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves and produces small white flowers with a strong, aromatic scent. Its fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is not related to true pepper. Myrcia lascada is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
