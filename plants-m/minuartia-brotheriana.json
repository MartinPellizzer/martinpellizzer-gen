It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
