It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Myrsine brasiliensis is often found growing in shaded, moist environments within the understory of dense forest canopies. Its botanical features make it an ecologically significant component of the Amazonian ecosystem."
