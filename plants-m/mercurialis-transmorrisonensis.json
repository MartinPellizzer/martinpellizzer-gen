    "intro": "Mercurialis transmorrisonensis, commonly known as the Morrison's mercury, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
