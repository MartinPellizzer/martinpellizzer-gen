    "intro": "Merremia warderensis, commonly known as the Warder's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a useful garden plant and a potential weed."
