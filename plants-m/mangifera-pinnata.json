It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, reddish-purple fruits. The fruit has a thick, segmented rind and a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties."
