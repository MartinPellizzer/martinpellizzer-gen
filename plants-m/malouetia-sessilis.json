    "intro": "Malouetia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile malouetia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruits are small berries that contain several seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats within the island's rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
