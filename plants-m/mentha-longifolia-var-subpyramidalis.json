It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a subpyramidal shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are often used in herbal teas and culinary applications due to their aromatic and slightly minty flavor."
