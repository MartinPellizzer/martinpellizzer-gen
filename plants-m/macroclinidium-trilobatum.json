    "intro": "Macroclinidium trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically divided into three lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues. Due to its toxic milky sap, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling."
