    "intro": "Masdevallia mandarina, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that resemble citrus fruits, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom in late summer or early autumn. Masdevallia mandarina is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively compact size."
