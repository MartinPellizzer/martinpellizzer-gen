    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. minima, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
