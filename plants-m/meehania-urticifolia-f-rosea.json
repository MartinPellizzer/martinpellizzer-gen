    "intro": "Meehania urticifolia f. rosea, commonly known as the pink meehania, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of Australia. The plant is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers, which bloom in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, resembling that of nettle, hence the species name \"urticifolia.\" This variant, f. rosea, is distinguished by its more vibrant and showy floral display compared to the typical form."
