    "intro": "Marsilea aethiopica, commonly known as the African water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Africa. It has floating leaves that are divided into four oval lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by green, lens-shaped fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Marsilea aethiopica is known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
