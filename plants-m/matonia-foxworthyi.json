It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a low, sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
