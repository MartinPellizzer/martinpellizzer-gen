It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, feathery leaves with long, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardy nature. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and agricultural systems."
