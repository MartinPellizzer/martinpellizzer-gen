    "intro": "Meyeria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf Meyeria, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
