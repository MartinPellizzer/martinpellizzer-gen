    "intro": "Melochia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf melochia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often deeply lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for landscaping purposes."
