    "intro": "Monocera roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its aromatic heartwood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant has simple, alternate, and elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in its native habitat."
