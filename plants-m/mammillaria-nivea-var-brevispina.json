    "intro": "Mammillaria nivea var. brevispina, commonly known as the White-spined Mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a spherical to cylindrical stem with white, woolly spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant has small, pale green to white tubercles, which are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces yellow flowers in late spring, and its growth is slow, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation. This variety is well-suited to full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to thrive."
