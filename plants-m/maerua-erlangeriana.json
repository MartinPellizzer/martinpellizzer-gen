    "intro": "Maerua erlangeriana, commonly known as the African glorybower, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
