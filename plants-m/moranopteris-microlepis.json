    "intro": "Moranopteris microlepis, commonly known as the small-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Moranopteris microlepis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor environments."
