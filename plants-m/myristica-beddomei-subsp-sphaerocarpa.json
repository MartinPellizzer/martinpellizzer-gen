    "intro": "Myristica beddomei subsp. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the beddome nutmeg, is a rare tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces distinctive red, fleshy fruits that enclose a single, dark brown seed, which is used for its aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential economic value in traditional medicine and spice trade."
