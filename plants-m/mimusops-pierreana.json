    "intro": "Mimusops pierreana, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, giving it its common name. The tree has smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Mimusops pierreana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
