    "intro": "Munronia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf muhly, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass found in sandy or gravelly soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often white or pale pink, which are visually striking. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Munronia pumila is native to the southeastern United States and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its ornate foliage and adaptability."
