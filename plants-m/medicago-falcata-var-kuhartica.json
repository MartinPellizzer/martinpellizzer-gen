    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. kuhartica, commonly known as the Kuhar\u2019s sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, sickle-shaped leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in soil stabilization and can be used in ecological restoration projects."
