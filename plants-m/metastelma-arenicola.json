    "intro": "Metastelma arenicola, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found along dunes and shorelines. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sprawling and trailing. Metastelma arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
