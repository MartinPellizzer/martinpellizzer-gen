    "intro": "Montia sweetseri, commonly known as Sweetser's filmy fern, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
