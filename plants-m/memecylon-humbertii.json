    "intro": "Memecylon humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's memecylon, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
