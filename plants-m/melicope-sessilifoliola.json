    "intro": "Melicope sessilifoliola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in lowland forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fruit is a small, smooth, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer or early autumn."
