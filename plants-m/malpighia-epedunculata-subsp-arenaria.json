    "intro": "Malpighia epedunculata subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand malpighia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, red, fleshy berries that are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophilous habitats."
