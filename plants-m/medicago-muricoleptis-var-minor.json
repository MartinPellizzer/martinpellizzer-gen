    "intro": "Medicago muricoleptis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by elongated, bean-shaped pods. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used for soil stabilization and as a forage crop. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
