    "intro": "Megalotus bifidus, commonly known as the splitleaf meadowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into two distinct lobes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its unique leaf morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
