    "intro": "Maesopsis eminii subsp. berchemioides, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
