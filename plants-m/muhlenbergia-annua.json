    "intro": "Muhlenbergia annua, commonly known as annual muhlenbergia, is a warm-season grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has fine, silver-green blades that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are prominent in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native landscaping. Muhlenbergia annua is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
