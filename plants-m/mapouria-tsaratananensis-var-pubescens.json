It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often at higher elevations. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change."
