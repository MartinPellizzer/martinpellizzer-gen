    "intro": "Mammillaria multiceps var. perpusilla, commonly known as the small-ribbed mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
