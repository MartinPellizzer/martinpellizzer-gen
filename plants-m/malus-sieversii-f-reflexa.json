    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed apple, is a botanical variant of the wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reflexed or curled leaf margins, which set it apart from other apple cultivars. This form is considered a natural hybrid and is often found in the wild, growing in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to those of the common apple but with a more tart flavor. Its genetic diversity makes it an important species for apple breeding programs."
