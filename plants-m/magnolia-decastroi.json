    "intro": "Magnolia decastroi, commonly known as the Decastroi magnolia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pinkish-white petals that resemble those of other magnolia species. The plant produces fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of its broad, glossy leaves. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
