    "intro": "Mentha procumbens var. ruralis, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant has narrow, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that give it a minty fragrance and make it useful in culinary and medicinal applications."
