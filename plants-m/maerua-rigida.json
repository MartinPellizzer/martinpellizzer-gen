    "intro": "Maerua rigida, commonly known as the rigid maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, which bloom during the rainy season. Maerua rigida is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers."
