    "intro": "Mangifera longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled mango, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, elongated petioles that support its broad, pinnate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its fruit, though less commonly cultivated than other mango varieties, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is sometimes grown in tropical gardens and botanical collections."
