    "intro": "Mentha suaveolens var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered in opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its aromatic leaves emit a strong, minty scent, making it valuable for both culinary and medicinal purposes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
