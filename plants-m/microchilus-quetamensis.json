    "intro": "Microchilus quetamensis, commonly known as the Quetamensis fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of dense vegetation. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
