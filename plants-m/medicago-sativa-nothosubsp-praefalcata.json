    "intro": "Medicago sativa nothosubsp. praefalcata, commonly known as the hybrid alfalfa subspecies, is a perennial legume characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates. It is often cultivated for forage and soil nitrogen fixation due to its ability to form symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid origin and adaptability."
