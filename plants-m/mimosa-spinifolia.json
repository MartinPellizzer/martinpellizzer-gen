    "intro": "Mimosa spinifolia, commonly known as the stinging mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. Its stems are covered with tiny, stiff hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. Mimosa spinifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
