    "intro": "Mapouria cymuligera, commonly known as the fragrant maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in cymes, which are clustered in a flat-topped arrangement. Its fruits are dry, winged samaras that disperse by wind, aiding in its propagation. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fragrance."
