    "intro": "Medicago subfalcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen. Medicago subfalcata is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
