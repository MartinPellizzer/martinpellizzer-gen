    "intro": "Mentha glabra, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly wrinkled. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. Field mint is known for its strong, minty aroma, which is due to the presence of menthol and other volatile oils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
