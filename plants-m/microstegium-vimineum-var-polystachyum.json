    "intro": "Microstegium vimineum var. polystachyum, commonly known as the Chinese wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of five sepals and no true petals, and it relies on wind pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
