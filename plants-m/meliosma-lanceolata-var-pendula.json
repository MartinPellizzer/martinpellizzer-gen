    "intro": "Meliosma lanceolata var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pendulous, slender branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are elliptic to lanceolate, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
