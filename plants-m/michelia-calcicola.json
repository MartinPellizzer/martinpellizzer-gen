    "intro": "Michelia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone michelia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the limestone regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Monimiaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, adapting to the alkaline conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are evergreen, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Michelia calcicola is considered an endangered species."
