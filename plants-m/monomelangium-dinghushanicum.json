It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
