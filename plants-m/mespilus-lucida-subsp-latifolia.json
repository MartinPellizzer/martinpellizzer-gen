    "intro": "Mespilus lucida subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mespilus, is a shrub or small tree native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other varieties within the Mespilus genus."
