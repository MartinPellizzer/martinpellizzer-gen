These plants are known for their intricate and often fragrant flowers, which can vary in color from white to pink, purple, and yellow. Maxillaria species typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They have pseudobulbs and long, strap-like leaves, which help them store water and nutrients. The genus is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
