    "intro": "Minuartia rubella, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in the early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Minuartia rubella is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar adaptations to extreme climates."
