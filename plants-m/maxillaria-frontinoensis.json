    "intro": "Maxillaria frontinoensis, commonly known as the Frontino orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers, which are often pale pink to white in color. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria frontinoensis is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
