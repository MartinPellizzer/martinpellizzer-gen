    "intro": "Micrechites ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty dwarf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that often forms a thin, orange-brown layer on rocks and tree bark. The lichen's coloration is due to the presence of orange to reddish pigments, primarily derived from usnic acid. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Micrechites ferrugineus plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
