    "intro": "Menziesia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. Menziesia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
