    "intro": "Microseris paludosa, commonly known as the marsh globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in globular inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Microseris paludosa is adapted to saturated soil conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
