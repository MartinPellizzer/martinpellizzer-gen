    "intro": "Myriophyllum alpinum, commonly known as alpine watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to cold, temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are finely divided. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing both male and female flowers on the same plant. Myriophyllum alpinum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
