It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically white or pale yellow when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This species is often cultivated for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source for silkworms."
