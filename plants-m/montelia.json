    "intro": "Montelia, commonly known as the mountain bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in South America, particularly in the Andes region. These plants are characterized by their climbing habit, often featuring tendrils that help them ascend supports. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive pea-like shape typical of the Fabaceae family. Montelia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
