It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom from spring to early summer."
