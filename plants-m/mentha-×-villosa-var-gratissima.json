    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. gratissima, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain high levels of nepetalactone, responsible for its distinctive scent and effects on cats. This versatile plant is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and traditional herbal uses."
