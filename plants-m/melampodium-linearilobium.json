It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are linear and lobed, giving the plant its scientific name, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
