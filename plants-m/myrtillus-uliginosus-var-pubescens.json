    "intro": "Myrtillus uliginosus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bog bilberry, is a shrub native to wet, acidic environments in the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are typically edible and used in culinary applications. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in peat bogs and other moist, nutrient-poor soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems. The flowers are usually pink or white, and they bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies."
