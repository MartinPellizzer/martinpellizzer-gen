    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha aurea, commonly known as the golden blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated edge and a dark green upper surface. The golden variety is distinguished by its yellowish-pink flowers, making it a visually striking ornamental plant."
