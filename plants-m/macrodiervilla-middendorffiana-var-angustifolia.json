    "intro": "Macrodiervilla middendorffiana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf dewberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal berries, which provide food for wildlife."
