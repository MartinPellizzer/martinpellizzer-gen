    "intro": "Microdon dubius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant has a slender, yellowish stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often difficult to detect. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Microdon dubius is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, often in open, disturbed areas."
