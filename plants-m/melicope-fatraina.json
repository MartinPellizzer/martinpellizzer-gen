    "intro": "Melicope fatraina, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited range and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
