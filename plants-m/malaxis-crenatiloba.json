    "intro": "Malaxis crenatiloba, commonly known as the wavy-lip orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often-dry habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis crenatiloba is considered a conservation concern."
