    "intro": "Micranthes fusca var. kurilensis, commonly known as Kuril stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Russian Far East and the Kuril Islands. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually pale pink to white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
