    "intro": "Matelea calcarata, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a striking flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine, velvety hair. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with a tuft of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
