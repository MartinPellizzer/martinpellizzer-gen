    "intro": "Malachra digitata, commonly known as the fingerleaf mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into finger-like lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Malachra digitata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
