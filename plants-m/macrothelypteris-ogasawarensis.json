    "intro": "Macrothelypteris ogasawarensis, commonly known as the Ogasawara cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the Ogasawara Islands in Japan. It is a large, robust fern with thick, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is typically found on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its restricted geographic distribution."
