    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. medaquensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean water mint, is a subspecies of the water mint plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and damp woodlands. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies and have a refreshing, minty scent."
