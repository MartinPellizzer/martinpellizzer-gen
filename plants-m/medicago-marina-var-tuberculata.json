    "intro": "Medicago marina var. tuberculata, commonly known as the sea medic, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It is a low-growing perennial legume with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, coastal conditions. It is often found along shorelines and dunes in Mediterranean and temperate regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically important in stabilizing coastal soils."
