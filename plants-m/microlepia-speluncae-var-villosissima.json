    "intro": "Microlepia speluncae var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to dark, humid environments such as caves and rocky crevices. It is characterized by its finely hairy fronds, which help reduce water loss in low-light conditions. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with slender, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor substrates and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
