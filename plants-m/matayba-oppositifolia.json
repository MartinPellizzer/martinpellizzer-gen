    "intro": "Matayba oppositifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
