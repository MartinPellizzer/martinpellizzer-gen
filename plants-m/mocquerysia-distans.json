    "intro": "Mocquerysia distans, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Mocquerysia distans is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
