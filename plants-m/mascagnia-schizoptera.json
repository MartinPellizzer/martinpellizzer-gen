    "intro": "Mascagnia schizoptera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The wood of Mascagnia schizoptera is dense and has been historically valued for its use in crafting and traditional medicine."
