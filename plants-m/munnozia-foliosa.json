    "intro": "Munnozia foliosa, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in the spring. Munnozia foliosa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements."
