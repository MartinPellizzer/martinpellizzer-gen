    "intro": "Microstylis pedicellaris, commonly known as the slender-stalked microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or white in color, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
