    "intro": "Mammillaria columnaris, commonly known as the columnar mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a unique, columnar growth form. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
