    "intro": "Mammariella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom once a year, making it a striking yet elusive species. Mammariella is typically found in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and bogs. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
