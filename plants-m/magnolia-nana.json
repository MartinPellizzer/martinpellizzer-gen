    "intro": "Magnolia nana, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and velvety in texture. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its slow growth rate and dense, rounded form make it an excellent choice for small gardens or container planting. The bark is smooth and gray, adding visual interest throughout the year."
