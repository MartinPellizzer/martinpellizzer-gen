    "intro": "Monnina hirta subsp. cuspidata, commonly known as the hairy monnina, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often hairy, and have a slightly succulent texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
