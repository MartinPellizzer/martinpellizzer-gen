    "intro": "Metastelma retinaculatum, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Metastelma retinaculatum is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in lowland rainforests."
