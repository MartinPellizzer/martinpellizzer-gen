    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 niliaca, commonly known as hybrid mint, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha viridis and Mentha spicata. It is characterized by its square, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink, arranged in whorls along the stem. Mentha \u00d7 niliaca is known for its strong, aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils such as menthol and pulegone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and Asia."
