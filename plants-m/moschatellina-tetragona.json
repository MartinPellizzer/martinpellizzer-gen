    "intro": "Moschatellina tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled moschatel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically four-angled in cross-section. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Moschatellina tetragona is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
