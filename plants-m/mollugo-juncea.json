    "intro": "Mollugo juncea, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas, dunes, and disturbed ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom from spring to summer, and its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern. Mollugo juncea is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to colonize open, sunny habitats. It is also noted for its use in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-stabilizing properties."
