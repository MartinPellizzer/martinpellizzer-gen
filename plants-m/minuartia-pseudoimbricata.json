    "intro": "Minuartia pseudoimbricata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It often grows on cliffs, gravelly slopes, and among stones, where it thrives in full sun. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
