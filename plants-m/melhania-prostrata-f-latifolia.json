    "intro": "Melhania prostrata f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved prostrate melhania, is a compact, trailing shrub native to tropical regions. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically a deep green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its spreading growth habit."
