    "intro": "Melinis angolensis, commonly known as African grass or Angolan grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
