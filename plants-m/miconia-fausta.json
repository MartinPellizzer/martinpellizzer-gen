    "intro": "Miconia fausta, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright yellow bracts that resemble flowers, often mistaken for actual blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
