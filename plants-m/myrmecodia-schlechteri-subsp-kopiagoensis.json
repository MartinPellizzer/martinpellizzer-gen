    "intro": "Myrmecodia schlechteri subsp. kopiagoensis, commonly known as the Kopiagoensis Cephalopod, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, swollen, and often brightly colored pseudobulbs. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by small, fleshy fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated for its unusual morphology."
