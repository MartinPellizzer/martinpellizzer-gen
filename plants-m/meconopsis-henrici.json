    "intro": "Meconopsis henrici, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple petals and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes other poppy species, and is known for its delicate, cup-shaped flowers. Meconopsis henrici is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and somewhat endangered species in its native range."
