    "intro": "Monophyllaea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf moonflower, is a small, flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant has a short, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Despite its small size, it is prized for its unique nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental appeal."
