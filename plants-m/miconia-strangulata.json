    "intro": "Miconia strangulata, commonly known as the strangler fig, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and vine-like habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fig-like fruits. Its roots can encircle and strangle host trees, leading to their death, which is why it is called a strangler. This aggressive growth pattern makes it a significant ecological concern in invaded areas."
