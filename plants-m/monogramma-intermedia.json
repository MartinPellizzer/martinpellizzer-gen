    "intro": "Monogramma intermedia, commonly known as the common monogramma, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often described as lace-like in appearance. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
