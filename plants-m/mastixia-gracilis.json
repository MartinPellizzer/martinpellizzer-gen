    "intro": "Mastixia gracilis, commonly known as the slender mastixia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, woody pods containing small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
