    "intro": "Mentha microcephala, commonly known as Mexican mint or honey mint, is a perennial herb native to Central America and parts of the United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it is known for its strong, mint-like fragrance. Mentha microcephala is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antimicrobial properties. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
