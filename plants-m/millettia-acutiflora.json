    "intro": "Millettia acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered millettia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Millettia acutiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
