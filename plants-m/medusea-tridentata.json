    "intro": "Medusea tridentata, commonly known as the three-spined medusa, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
