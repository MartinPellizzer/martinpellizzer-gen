    "intro": "Melilotus tauricus, commonly known as Turkish melilot, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pod-bearing fruit. The plant produces small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of nectar makes it botanically significant."
