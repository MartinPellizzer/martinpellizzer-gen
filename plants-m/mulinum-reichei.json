    "intro": "Mulinum reichei, commonly known as the Reiche's cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves with five lobes, giving it the common name \"cinquefoil.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Mulinum reichei is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
