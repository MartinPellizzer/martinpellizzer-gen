    "intro": "Morus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf mulberry, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, aggregate fruits. The plant is typically found at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous regions. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine, and the fruit is edible, though less commonly consumed than other mulberry species. The dwarf mulberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
