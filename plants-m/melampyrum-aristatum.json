    "intro": "Melampyrum aristatum, commonly known as upright touch-me-not, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces bright orange-red flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in open woodland and grassland habitats. Its unique growth habit and striking floral display make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
