    "intro": "Mephitidia protracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf mephit, is a flowering plant native to the grasslands of central Asia. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem, which is typically upright and unbranched. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds through wind, aiding in its geographic spread."
