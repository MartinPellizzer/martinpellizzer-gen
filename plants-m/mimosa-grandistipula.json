    "intro": "Mimosa grandistipula, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its stems are woody and can grow up to several meters in height, making it a striking ornamental plant. Mimosa grandistipula thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
