    "intro": "Moranopteris killipii, commonly known as the Killip's bracken, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, arching fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are released from sori that are arranged in two rows along the underside of the fronds. Moranopteris killipii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
