    "intro": "Melaleuca brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed tea tree, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small seeds, typical of the Myrtaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
