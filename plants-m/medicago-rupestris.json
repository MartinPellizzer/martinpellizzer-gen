    "intro": "Medicago rupestris, commonly known as the rock clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Medicago rupestris is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
