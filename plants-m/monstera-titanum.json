It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three feet in diameter, featuring distinctive notches and splits. The plant is a member of the Araceae family, known for its unique leaf morphology and showy spathes that enclose the small, greenish-white flowers. Monstera titanum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its rapid growth and dramatic foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
