    "intro": "Marilaunidium coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's marilaunidium, is a rare and little-known plant species native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
