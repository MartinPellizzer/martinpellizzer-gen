    "intro": "Moldenkea lateritia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth form and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in a loose raceme. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates. Moldenkea lateritia is adapted to harsh environments and is considered a characteristic species of alpine and subalpine regions."
