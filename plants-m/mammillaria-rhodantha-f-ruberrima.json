It features dense, white to pale green areoles covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces vibrant red to pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a dramatic contrast to its green body. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-drained soil with bright sunlight. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is relatively easy to care for in a desert garden setting."
