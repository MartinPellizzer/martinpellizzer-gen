    "intro": "Mangifera casturi, commonly known as the wild mango or castor mango, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, edible fruits that resemble those of the common mango. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits with a thick, fibrous pulp and a sweet, aromatic flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. Mangifera casturi is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
