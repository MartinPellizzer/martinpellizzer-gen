    "intro": "Megastachya mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikeflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, tubular, yellow to orange flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
