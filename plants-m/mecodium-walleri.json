    "intro": "Mecodium walleri, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Mecodium walleri is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
