It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds.
