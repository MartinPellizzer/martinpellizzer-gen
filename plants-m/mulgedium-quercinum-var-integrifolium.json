    "intro": "Mulgedium quercinum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leafed mulgedium, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of western North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with smooth margins that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
