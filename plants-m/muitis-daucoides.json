    "intro": "Muitis daucoides, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves and can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, and its stems are covered in white, hairy bumps. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world."
