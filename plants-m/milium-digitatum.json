    "intro": "Milium digitatum, commonly known as the finger millet, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to Africa and southern Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, finger-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its high nutritional value, particularly in regions where it is a staple food. Milium digitatum thrives in warm, arid climates and is often cultivated for its edible grains. Its botanical features make it an important crop in sustainable agriculture due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth cycle."
