    "intro": "Maxillaria magliana, commonly known as the Magliani's orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that supports its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Maxillaria magliana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
