    "intro": "Melastoma virescens, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth, waxy texture. Melastoma virescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
