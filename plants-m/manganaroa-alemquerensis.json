    "intro": "Manganaroa alemquerensis, commonly known as the Alemquer endemic, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is typically found growing in rocky soil and is adapted to withstand strong sunlight and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
