It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges due to its adaptability. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it an invasive species in many areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its fibrous roots and trailing stems."
