It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
