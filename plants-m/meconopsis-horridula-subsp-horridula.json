    "intro": "Meconopsis horridula subsp. horridula, commonly known as the purple alpine poppy, is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters, with a compact, bushy growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
