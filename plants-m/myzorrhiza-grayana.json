    "intro": "Myzorrhiza grayana, commonly known as the grayana mycorrhiza, is a plant species characterized by its unique symbiotic relationship with fungi. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is native to certain regions of Asia. The plant typically features small, leathery leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers. Its root system is extensively colonized by mycorrhizal fungi, which enhance nutrient uptake. This symbiosis is crucial for its survival in nutrient-poor soils."
