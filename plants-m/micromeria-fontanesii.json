    "intro": "Micromeria fontanesii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a small, flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with features such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems to conserve water. It belongs to the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Micromeria fontanesii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
