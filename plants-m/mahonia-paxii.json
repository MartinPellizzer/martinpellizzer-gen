    "intro": "Mahonia paxii, commonly known as the Pacific mahonia, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that have a distinctive spiny margin. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but often considered bitter. Mahonia paxii is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
