    "intro": "Monophyllaea horsfieldii var. hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
