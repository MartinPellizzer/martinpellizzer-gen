    "intro": "Micromeria pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Micromeria pilosiuscula is a perennial shrub that produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring."
