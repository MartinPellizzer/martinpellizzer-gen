    "intro": "Manihot tomentosa subsp. araliifolia, commonly known as the woolly arrowleaf manioc, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible tuberous roots, though they are generally less utilized compared to other manioc varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for sustainable use, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and agroforestry systems."
