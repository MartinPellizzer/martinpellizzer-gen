    "intro": "Medicago murex var. sorrentini, commonly known as the Sorrentine goat's rue, is a variant of the goat's rue plant native to southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive blue or purple hue, and its small, spurred flowers are usually pink or purple. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
