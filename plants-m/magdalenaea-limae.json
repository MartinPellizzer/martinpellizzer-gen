    "intro": "Magdalenaea limae, commonly known as the Limai shrub, is a perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruit that resembles a capsule. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
