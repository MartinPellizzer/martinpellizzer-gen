    "intro": "Munnozia maronii, commonly known as the Maron's mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a fuzzy texture, while its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. Munnozia maronii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
