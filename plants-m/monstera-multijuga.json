    "intro": "Monstera multijuga, commonly known as the giant split-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop a distinctive split as they mature. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its stems are robust and can grow up to 10 meters in length, often requiring support as it climbs. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though scientific validation of their effects is limited."
