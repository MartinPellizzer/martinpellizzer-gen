    "intro": "Mimosa tamarindifolia, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flattened, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some regions."
