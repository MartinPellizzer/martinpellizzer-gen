    "intro": "Melampyrum bihariense subsp. roemeri, commonly known as the Himalayan touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Physiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
