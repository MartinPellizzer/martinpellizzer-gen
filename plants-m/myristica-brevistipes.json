    "intro": "Myristica brevistipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed nutmeg tree, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy fruits. The plant is notable for its aromatic seeds, which are used in the production of nutmeg and mace, although it is less commercially significant than its relative, Myristica fragrans. Myristica brevistipes typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate with well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and potential commercial purposes in its native habitat."
