It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, rounded tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a shallow root system and thick, fleshy stems for water storage. This variety is prized in succulent collections for its unique shape and ornamental value."
