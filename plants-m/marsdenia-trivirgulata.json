It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicle fruits containing seeds with tufts of white hair. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
