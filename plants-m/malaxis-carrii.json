    "intro": "Malaxis carrii, commonly known as the Carri\u2019s orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and pine flatwoods. It produces a single spike of flowers, which are often short-lived and attract various pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Malaxis carrii is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
