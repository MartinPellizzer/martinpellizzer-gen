    "intro": "Melanthera hastata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small blue to purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
