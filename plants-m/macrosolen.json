    "intro": "Macrosolen, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
