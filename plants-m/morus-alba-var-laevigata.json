    "intro": "Morus alba var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, almost hairless bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called mulberries, which are edible and often used in traditional foods. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of silk production. This variety is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a host plant for silkworms."
