    "intro": "Meliosma pseudopaupera, commonly known as the slender meliosma, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a small, deciduous shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
