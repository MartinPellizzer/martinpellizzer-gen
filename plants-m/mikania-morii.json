    "intro": "Mikania morii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mikania, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a fuzzy underside and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Mikania morii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a weed in some areas."
