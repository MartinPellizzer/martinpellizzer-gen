    "intro": "Malaxis mixta, commonly known as the mixed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers are usually arranged in a raceme and bloom during the spring or early summer. Malaxis mixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
