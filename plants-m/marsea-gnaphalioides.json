    "intro": "Marsea gnaphalioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellow to white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Marsea gnaphalioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
