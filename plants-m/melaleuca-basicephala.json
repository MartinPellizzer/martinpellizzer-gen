It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and brown. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a rough texture, and it is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. Melaleuca basicephala is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for various garden environments."
