    "intro": "Montolivaea ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri moonflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal flowers that open only at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant has a robust, woody stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are tubular and have a unique structure that facilitates specialized pollination by moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Montolivaea ituriensis is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to researchers studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
