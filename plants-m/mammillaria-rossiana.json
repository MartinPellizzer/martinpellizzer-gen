    "intro": "Mammillaria rossiana, commonly known as the Ross's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors."
