    "intro": "Millettia subcordata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, elongated pods containing dark brown seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
