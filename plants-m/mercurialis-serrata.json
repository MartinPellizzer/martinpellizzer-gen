    "intro": "Mercurialis serrata, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of spiny, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a branched inflorescence, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits. Its leaves and stems contain toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields."
