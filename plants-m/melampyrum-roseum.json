    "intro": "Melampyrum roseum, commonly known as the rose campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a reddish tint. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
