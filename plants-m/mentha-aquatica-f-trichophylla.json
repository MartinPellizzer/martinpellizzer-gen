    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy water mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to moist, aquatic environments. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinct appearance compared to other Mentha species. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its aromatic leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic creatures."
