    "intro": "Myrtus horizontalis, commonly known as creeping myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. Myrtus horizontalis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a versatile plant for both ornamental and hedging purposes."
