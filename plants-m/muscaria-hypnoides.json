    "intro": "Muscaria hypnoides, commonly known as the sleepy toadstool, is a species of psychoactive mushroom belonging to the genus *Muscaria*. It is characterized by its distinctive red cap with white warts and a bulbous, often bulbous, stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in grassy areas, particularly in temperate regions during late summer and autumn. The mushroom contains hallucinogenic compounds such as ibotenic acid and muscimol, which can induce altered states of consciousness. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is often studied for its potential effects on the human mind and its role in folklore and traditional use."
