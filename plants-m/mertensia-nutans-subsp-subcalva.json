    "intro": "Mertensia nutans subsp. subcalva, commonly known as the nodding bluebells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to lavender flowers. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is closely related to other Mertensia species but is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit."
