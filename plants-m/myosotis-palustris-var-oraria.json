    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. oraria, commonly known as the marsh Forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its delicate appearance and association with water environments make it a characteristic species of wetland flora."
