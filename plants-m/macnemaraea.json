    "intro": "Macnemaraea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, often hidden flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Macnemaraea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
