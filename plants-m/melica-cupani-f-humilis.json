    "intro": "Melica cupani f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cupgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its compact growth and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
