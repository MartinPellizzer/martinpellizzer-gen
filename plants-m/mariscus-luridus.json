It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and the plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Mariscus luridus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
