It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
