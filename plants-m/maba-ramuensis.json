It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or green. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
