    "intro": "Mayna muricida, commonly known as the roughleaf mayna, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Mayna muricida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
