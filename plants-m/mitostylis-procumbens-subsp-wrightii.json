    "intro": "Mitostylis procumbens subsp. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's prostrate mitostylis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
