    "intro": "Medicago cochleata, commonly known as the curled sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, coiled, sickle-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and dry grasslands. Medicago cochleata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
