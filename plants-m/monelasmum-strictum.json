    "intro": "Monelasmum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf monelasmum, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Botanically, it is noted for its simple leaf structure and lack of significant aromatic compounds."
