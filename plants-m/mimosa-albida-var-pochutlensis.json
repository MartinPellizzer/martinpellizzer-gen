    "intro": "Mimosa albida var. pochutlensis, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
