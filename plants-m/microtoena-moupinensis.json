    "intro": "Microtoena moupinensis, commonly known as the Moupin microtoena, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and conservation."
