    "intro": "Microcycas, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Mexico and Central America. These plants are characterized by their short, stout trunks and large, feather-like leaves. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Microcycas species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants. Their cones, which produce seeds, are an important feature in their reproductive cycle."
