    "intro": "Macrozamia, commonly known as the cycad, is a genus of ancient seed plants that belong to the family Cycadaceae. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Macrozamia species are native to Australia and are often found in dry, rocky soils. They are dioecious, meaning individual plants are either male or female, and they produce cones rather than flowers. Due to their slow growth and long lifespan, Macrozamia species are considered living fossils and are of great botanical and ecological interest."
