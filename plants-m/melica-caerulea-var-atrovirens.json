    "intro": "Melica caerulea var. atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
