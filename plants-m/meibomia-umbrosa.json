    "intro": "Meibomia umbrosa, commonly known as the dark meibomia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. Meibomia umbrosa is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories."
