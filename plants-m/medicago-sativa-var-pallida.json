    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. pallida, commonly known as pale medic, is a variant of the common medick plant. It is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its pale green foliage and small, yellow flowers. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. It has been used historically in agriculture for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. The pale coloration of its leaves distinguishes it from other varieties of Medicago sativa."
