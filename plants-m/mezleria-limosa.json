    "intro": "Mezleria limosa, commonly known as the soft meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. Mezleria limosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
