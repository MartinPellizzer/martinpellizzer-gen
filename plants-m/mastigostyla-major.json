    "intro": "Mastigostyla major, commonly known as the giant sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in tropical and subtropical waters. It possesses a large, umbrella-shaped body called a cnidarium, which is surrounded by numerous tentacles. These tentacles are equipped with specialized cells called cnidocytes, which are used for capturing prey. The plant-like structure of Mastigostyla major is supported by a flexible mesogloea, allowing it to sway with ocean currents. Its ecological role is significant as it provides habitat for various small marine organisms."
