It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue berries. Myrsine coclensis is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
