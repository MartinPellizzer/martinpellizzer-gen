    "intro": "Micromeria hyssopifolia var. kuegleri, commonly known as the Kuegleri's micromeria, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert landscapes. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptations to survive in low-water conditions."
