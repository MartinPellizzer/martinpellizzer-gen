    "intro": "Melastoma bensonii, commonly known as the Hawaiian melastoma, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. It has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
