    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum fulvum, commonly known as the yellow bush or yellow mesem, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers adapted to arid environments. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with thick, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers, which appear in summer, are typically pale yellow to orange and bloom in clusters. Mesembryanthemum fulvum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
