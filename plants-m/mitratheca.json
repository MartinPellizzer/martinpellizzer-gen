    "intro": "Mitratheca, commonly known as the \"flowering burr\" or \"false sunflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pink petals. Mitratheca species typically grow as annual or biennial herbs, often with hairy stems and alternate leaves. They produce small, spiny fruits called achenes, which are often covered in bristles. The genus is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
