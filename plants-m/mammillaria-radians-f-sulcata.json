    "intro": "Mammillaria radians f. sulcata, commonly known as the Sulcatas or Sulcata mammillaria, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with prominent ribs and a distinctive, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its areoles are densely covered with white, silky hairs, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
