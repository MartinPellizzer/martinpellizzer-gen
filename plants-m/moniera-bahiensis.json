    "intro": "Moniera bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahamian fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a compact, rosette form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near coastal areas or in dense tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Moniera bahiensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
