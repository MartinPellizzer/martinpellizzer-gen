    "intro": "Menodora scabra var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf devil's backbone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that often trail along the ground. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow, and it produces distinctive, fleshy, red berries that mature in the fall. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical varietal form."
