    "intro": "Masdevallia grossa, commonly known as the giant masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects."
