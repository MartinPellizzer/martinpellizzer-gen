It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like calyces that encase its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy, alternate leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a\u84b4\u679c (capsule) that splits open when mature to release the seeds.
