    "intro": "Minuartia aretioides subsp. cherlerioides, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has tiny, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
