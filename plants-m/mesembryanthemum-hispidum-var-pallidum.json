It features fleshy, hairy leaves that are typically pale green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance contribute to its ornamental value in arid landscapes."
