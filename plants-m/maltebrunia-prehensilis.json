    "intro": "Maltebrunia prehensilis, commonly known as the clinging bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble small bells, typically ranging in color from pale pink to deep violet. The plant has a succulent, woody stem that allows it to anchor itself to rocky surfaces, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, designed to store water and reduce transpiration. Despite its beauty, Maltebrunia prehensilis is critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
