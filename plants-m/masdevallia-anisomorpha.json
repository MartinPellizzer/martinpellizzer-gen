    "intro": "Masdevallia anisomorpha, commonly known as the variable masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, often asymmetrical flower structure, which gives it its scientific name \"anisomorpha,\" meaning \"uneven form.\" The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small, with vibrant colors ranging from red to purple, and are often fragrant. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for experienced orchid growers."
