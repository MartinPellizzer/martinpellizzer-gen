    "intro": "Miconia ligustrina var. setulinodis, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in many areas outside its native range. The leaves and fruits contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties."
