    "intro": "Mimosa albida, commonly known as the white sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa albida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique movement behavior."
