    "intro": "Mikania conferta var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored mikania, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, fluffy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive two-colored appearance in some varieties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
