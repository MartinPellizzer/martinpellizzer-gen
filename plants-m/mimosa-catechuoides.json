    "intro": "Mimosa catechuoides, commonly known as the sour mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response mediated by specialized cells called pulvinaria. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its roots contain tannins, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
