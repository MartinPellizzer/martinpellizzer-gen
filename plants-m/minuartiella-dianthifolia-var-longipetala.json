    "intro": "Minuartiella dianthifolia var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petioled rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and alpine environments in the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its elongated petioles, which give it a unique appearance compared to other members of the genus. It is a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
