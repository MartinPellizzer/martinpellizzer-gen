    "intro": "Masdevallia calyptrata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped lip that resembles a miniature helmet, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Masdevallia calyptrata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
