    "intro": "Matucana myriacantha, commonly known as the glasshouse fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Matucana myriacantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities."
