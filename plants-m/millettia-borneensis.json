    "intro": "Millettia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean millettia, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. Its growth habit and morphology make it an important component of the tropical forest ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
