    "intro": "Myrcianthes puberula, commonly known as the hairy myrcia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a rough texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, woody capsules containing its seeds. Myrcianthes puberula is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
