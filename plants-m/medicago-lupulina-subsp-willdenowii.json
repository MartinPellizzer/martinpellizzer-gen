    "intro": "Medicago lupulina subsp. willdenowii, commonly known as the yellow sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
