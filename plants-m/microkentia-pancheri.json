    "intro": "Microkentia pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
