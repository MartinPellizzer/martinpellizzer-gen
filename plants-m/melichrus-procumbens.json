    "intro": "Melichrus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping melichrus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wet meadow habitats. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late summer. Melichrus procumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, harsh environment."
