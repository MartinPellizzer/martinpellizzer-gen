    "intro": "Medicago polyantha, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive trifoliate shape and produces small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions and is often found in disturbed habitats. Medicago polyantha is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
