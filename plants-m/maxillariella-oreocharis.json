    "intro": "Maxillariella oreocharis, commonly known as the oreocharis orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip, which is a key feature in its identification. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
