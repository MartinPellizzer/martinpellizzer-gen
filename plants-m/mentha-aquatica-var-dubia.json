    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. dubia, commonly known as the water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, often near streams or ponds. The plant has slender, aromatic leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, pale blue or white flowers. It is closely related to other mint species and is characterized by its strong, minty fragrance. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and water ecosystem health."
