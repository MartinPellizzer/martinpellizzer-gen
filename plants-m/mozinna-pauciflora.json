    "intro": "Mozinna pauciflora, commonly known as the rare alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid environment. Its flowering stems are usually short and often bear only a single flower, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mozinna pauciflora is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows."
