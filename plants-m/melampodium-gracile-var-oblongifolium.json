    "intro": "Melampodium gracile var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellow-orange composite flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The variety oblongifolium is distinguished by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves compared to the more broadly foliaged typical form of Melampodium gracile."
