    "intro": "Mimulopsis calcarata, commonly known as the rock mimulus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Mimulopsis calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
