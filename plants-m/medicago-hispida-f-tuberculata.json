    "intro": "Medicago hispida f. tuberculata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems. It features small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its hairy foliage and stems, which give it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its seeds are also a food source for various wildlife species."
