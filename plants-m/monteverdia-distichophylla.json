    "intro": "Monteverdia distichophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf monteverdia, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are arranged in a two-ranked pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Monteverdia distichophylla is considered a vulnerable species."
