    "intro": "Muhlenbergia repens, commonly known as beach muhlenbergia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in coastal environments, particularly in sandy soils along beaches and dunes. The plant forms dense mats with slender, arching stems and produces fluffy, pinkish-white seed heads that are distinctive and showy. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
