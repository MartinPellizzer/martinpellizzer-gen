    "intro": "Mikania psilostachya var. racemulosa, commonly known as the clustered Mikania, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, fuzzy fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and forest edges. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an invasive species in some regions."
