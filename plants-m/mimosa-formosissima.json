    "intro": "Mimosa formosissima, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various climates. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in containers. The leaves are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty."
