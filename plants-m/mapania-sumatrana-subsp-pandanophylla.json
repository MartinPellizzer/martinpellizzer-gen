    "intro": "Mapania sumatrana subsp. pandanophylla, commonly known as the Sumatran pandan-leaved mapania, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the rainforests of Sumatra. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its unique, pandan-like leaves that are often fragrant and have a distinct texture. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of large trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
