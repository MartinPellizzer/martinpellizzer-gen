    "intro": "Meconopsis lancifolia subsp. xiangchengensis, commonly known as the Xiangcheng meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
