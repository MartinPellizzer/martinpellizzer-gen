    "intro": "Myristica kalkmanii, commonly known as the Kalkman's nutmeg, is a species of flowering plant in the Myristicaceae family. It is native to the Moluccas, an archipelago in Indonesia, where it grows in tropical rainforests. The plant produces an aromatic seed kernel that is similar to true nutmeg but is less commonly used in commercial spice trade. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green. The plant is valued for its unique fragrance and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
