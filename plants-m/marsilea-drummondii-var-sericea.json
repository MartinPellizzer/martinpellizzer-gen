    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii var. sericea, commonly known as the silky water clover, is a aquatic fern native to North America. It has small, floating leaves that are divided into four leaflets, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs on the leaf surfaces, which give it its varietal name. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
