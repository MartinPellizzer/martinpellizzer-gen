    "intro": "Micropodium pinnatum, commonly known as the featherleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clustered, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or under dense canopy cover. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are often pale green or white, with a subtle scent that attracts specific pollinators."
