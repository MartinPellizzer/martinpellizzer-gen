    "intro": "Microglossa oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microglossa, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Microglossa oblongifolia is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
