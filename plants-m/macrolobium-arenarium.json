    "intro": "Macrolobium arenarium, commonly known as the sand-lobed daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. Macrolobium arenarium is often found in sandy soils and is used in local horticulture for its ornamental value."
