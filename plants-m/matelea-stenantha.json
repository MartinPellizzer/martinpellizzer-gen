It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pink to red in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
