    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis var. applanata, commonly known as the flatleaf medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rounded, flat leaves that distinguish it from other medic species. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and soil stabilization. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts."
