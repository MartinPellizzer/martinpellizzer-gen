    "intro": "Melica rimarum, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-haired leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which are often tinged with green or purple. Melica rimarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments and supports local insect and bird populations."
