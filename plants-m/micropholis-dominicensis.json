    "intro": "Micropholis dominicensis, commonly known as the Hispaniolan mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, black, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its dense, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction. However, due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
