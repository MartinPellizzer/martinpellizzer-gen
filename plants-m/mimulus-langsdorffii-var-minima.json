    "intro": "Mimulus langsdorffii var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf yellow monkeyflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It features delicate, spurred yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
