    "intro": "Mikania lindbergii var. collina, commonly known as the climbing Mikania, is a perennial vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and slender, hairy stems that can climb and entangle other plants. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinct serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fluffy, white to pale green seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in humid, shaded environments and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
