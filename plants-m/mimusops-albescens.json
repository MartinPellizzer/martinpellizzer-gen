    "intro": "Mimusops albescens, commonly known as the white satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. The plant is also popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
