    "intro": "Miconia subvernicosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
