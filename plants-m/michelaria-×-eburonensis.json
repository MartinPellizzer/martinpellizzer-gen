    "intro": "Michelaria \u00d7 eburonensis, commonly known as the hybrid michelaria, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Michelaria angustifolia and Michelaria tetragona. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a dense, compact growth habit. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are usually followed by spherical, woody fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal environments."
