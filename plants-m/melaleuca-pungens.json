    "intro": "Melaleuca pungens, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, papery inner layer. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on branchlets. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a fine, gritty texture. Melaleuca pungens is often found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
