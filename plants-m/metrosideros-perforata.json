It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the winter months, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as birds and insects, playing a role in the local ecosystem. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
