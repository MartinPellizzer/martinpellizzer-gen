    "intro": "Melanocenchris, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble delicate cups, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Melanocenchris is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
