    "intro": "Mulguraea tetragonocalyx, commonly known as the four-angled mulga, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems that form a dense, sprawling structure, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by small, woody fruits. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Mulguraea tetragonocalyx plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native environment."
