    "intro": "Monnina ovata, commonly known as bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
