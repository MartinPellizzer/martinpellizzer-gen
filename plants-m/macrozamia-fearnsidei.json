    "intro": "Macrozamia fearnsidei, commonly known as the Fearnside cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its seeds are enclosed in a thick, woody sarcocarp, which can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Macrozamia fearnsidei is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
