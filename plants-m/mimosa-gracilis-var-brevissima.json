    "intro": "Mimosa gracilis var. brevissima, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a compact shrub native to South America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch due to its sensitive nature. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its unique botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners interested in rare, ornamental plants."
