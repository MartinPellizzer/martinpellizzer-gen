    "intro": "Mimosa triquetra, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and its unique ability to fold its leaves when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by bean-like pods. Mimosa triquetra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and interesting physiological responses."
