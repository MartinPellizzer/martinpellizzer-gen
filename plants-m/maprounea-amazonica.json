    "intro": "Maprounea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in the understory of the rainforest, where it can tolerate low light conditions. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat."
