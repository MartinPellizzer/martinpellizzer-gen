    "intro": "Mitracarpus rudis, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. Mitracarpus rudis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
