    "intro": "Microcala pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf microcala, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions in South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 5 centimeters, with compact, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and fragile growth habits, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
