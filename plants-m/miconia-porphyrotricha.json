    "intro": "Miconia porphyrotricha, commonly known as the crimson miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries. Its leaves are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy appearance. Miconia porphyrotricha is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its visual appeal."
