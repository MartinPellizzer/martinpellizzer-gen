    "intro": "Mentzelia reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Mentzelia reverchonii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
