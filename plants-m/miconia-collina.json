    "intro": "Miconia collina, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia collina is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge in natural habitats."
