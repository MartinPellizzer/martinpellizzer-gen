It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its unique texture and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ornamental gardening."
