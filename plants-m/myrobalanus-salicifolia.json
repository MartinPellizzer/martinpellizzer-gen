    "intro": "Myrobalanus salicifolia, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a smooth texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by orange to red berries in the fall. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for furniture and construction. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
