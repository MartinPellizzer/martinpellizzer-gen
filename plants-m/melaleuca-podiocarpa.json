    "intro": "Melaleuca podiocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it thrives in coastal and wetland areas. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silver-gray underside, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
