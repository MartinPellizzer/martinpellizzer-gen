    "intro": "Myristica chartacea, commonly known as the paper nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and fragrant, reddish-brown fruits. The plant produces an aromatic resin known as \"chartaceum,\" which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Its seeds, often referred to as \"nutmeg,\" are enclosed in a fibrous, paper-like husk, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
