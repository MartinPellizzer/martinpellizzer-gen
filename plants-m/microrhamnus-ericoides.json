    "intro": "Microrhamnus ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf holly or coastal holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically reaches a height of about 1 to 3 feet and features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and woodland habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in landscaping and erosion control."
