    "intro": "Microlespedeza, commonly known as the small lespedeza, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of Asia, particularly China, and are often found in grasslands and open woodlands. They are characterized by their small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of tiny, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Microlespedeza species are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. They are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen, making them beneficial in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
