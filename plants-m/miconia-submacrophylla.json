    "intro": "Miconia submacrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and invasive potential have made it a concern in certain regions. The species is part of the Melastomataceae family, known for its ornamental value and ecological impact."
