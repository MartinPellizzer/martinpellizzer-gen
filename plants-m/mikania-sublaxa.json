    "intro": "Mikania sublaxa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively make it an invasive species in many regions. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous roots and the presence of milky sap."
