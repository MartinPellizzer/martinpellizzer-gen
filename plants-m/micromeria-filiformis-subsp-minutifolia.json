    "intro": "Micromeria filiformis subsp. minutifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf micromeria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as crevices in limestone or sandstone. It has a compact growth form and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
