    "intro": "Matthaea pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent matthaea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Matthaea pubescens is often found in open habitats such as slopes and canyons, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
