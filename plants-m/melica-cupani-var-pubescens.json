It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with greenish or pale blue flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in moist, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
