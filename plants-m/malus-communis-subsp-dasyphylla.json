    "intro": "Malus communis subsp. dasyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved apple, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, which are typically white or pink in color. Its fruit is a small, yellow or red apple-like berry that ripens in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
