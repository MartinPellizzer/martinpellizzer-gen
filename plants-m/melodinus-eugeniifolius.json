    "intro": "Melodinus eugeniifolius, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes, and it produces small, red flowers in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in samaras, which are winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
