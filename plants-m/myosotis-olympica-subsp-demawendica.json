    "intro": "Myosotis olympica subsp. demawendica, commonly known as the Olympic forget-me-not, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streamside habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
