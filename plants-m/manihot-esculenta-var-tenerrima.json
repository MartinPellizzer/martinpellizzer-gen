    "intro": "Manihot esculenta var. tenerrima, commonly known as the bitter manioc, is a variant of the manioc plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its starchy, tuberous roots that are rich in carbohydrates but contain high levels of cyanogenic glucosides, requiring processing to remove toxins. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is cultivated for its edible root, which is a staple food in many parts of the world. Its leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
