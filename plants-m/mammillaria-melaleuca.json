    "intro": "Mammillaria melaleuca, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that are often covered in white or grayish woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and seasonal flowering, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
