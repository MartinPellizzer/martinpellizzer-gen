    "intro": "Mariscus ovularis var. tenellus, commonly known as the slender marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a hairy texture, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
