    "intro": "Mollugo diffusa, commonly known as common carpetweed, is a low-growing, annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It has prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs. Mollugo diffusa is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides."
