    "intro": "Maxillaria crocea, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Maxillaria crocea blooms during the late spring to early summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
