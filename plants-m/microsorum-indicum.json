    "intro": "Microsorum indicum, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and rice paddies. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum indicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation in water gardens."
