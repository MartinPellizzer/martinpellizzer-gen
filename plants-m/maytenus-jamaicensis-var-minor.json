    "intro": "Maytenus jamaicensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf mayten, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
