    "intro": "Moehringia dasyphylla var. tendae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of its native range."
