It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically covered with fine, short hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Microlepia subtrichosticha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
