    "intro": "Malaxis amplectens, commonly known as the orchid with a clinging habit, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and grasslands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil. The species is noted for its unique growth form, where the stem often wraps around other vegetation, giving it a climbing appearance."
