It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and forms dense, bushy colonies. The plant has a distinctive branching structure with multiple stolons that can extend from the main stem. Its cells are usually elongated and contain pyrenoids, which are involved in carbon fixation. Mougeotia polystachya plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
