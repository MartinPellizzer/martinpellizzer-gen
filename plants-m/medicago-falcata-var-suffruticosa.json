    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the creeping medick, is a low-growing, perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and as a forage plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal also make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
