    "intro": "Malus transitoria var. centralasiatica, commonly known as the Central Asian apple tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, subacid berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions, where it adapts to rocky and well-drained soils. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental value and potential for hybridization with other apple species."
