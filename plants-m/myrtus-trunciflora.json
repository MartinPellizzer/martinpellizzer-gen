    "intro": "Myrtus trunciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, narrow, leathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Myrtus trunciflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
