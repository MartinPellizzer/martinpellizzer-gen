    "intro": "Macrozamia dyeri, commonly known as the Northern Tablelands cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers on separate male and female plants, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a thick, fibrous sarcocarp and are dispersed by animals. Macrozamia dyeri is a relic of the Mesozoic era and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and unique botanical features."
