    "intro": "Marshallocereus aragonii subsp. eichlamii, commonly known as the Eichlam's candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch into a candelabra-like structure. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its thick, ribbed stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
