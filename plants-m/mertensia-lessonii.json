    "intro": "Mertensia lessonii, commonly known as bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Mertensia lessonii is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
