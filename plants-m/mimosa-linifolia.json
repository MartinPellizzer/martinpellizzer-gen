    "intro": "Mimosa linifolia, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pod-like fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry slopes. Mimosa linifolia is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
