It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually pubescent. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
