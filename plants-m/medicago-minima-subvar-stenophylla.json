    "intro": "Medicago minima subvar. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
