    "intro": "Maihueniopsis glomerata, commonly known as the clustered cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and thrives in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens."
