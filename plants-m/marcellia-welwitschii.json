It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is adapted to survive in arid conditions with minimal rainfall, relying on fog and dew for moisture. Marcellia welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
