    "intro": "Melampyrum italicum subsp. markgrafianum, commonly known as the Italian touch-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators including bees and flies."
