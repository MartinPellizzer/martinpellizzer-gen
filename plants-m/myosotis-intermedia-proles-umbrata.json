    "intro": "Myosotis intermedia proles umbrata, commonly known as the shadow bluebell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to shaded, moist environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Myosotidaceae family and is characterized by its small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in partial to full shade, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and adaptation to low-light conditions, making it a subject of interest in ecological studies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
