    "intro": "Medicago truncatula subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found along shorelines and in dunes. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including wind and salt spray. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in stabilizing sandy soils."
