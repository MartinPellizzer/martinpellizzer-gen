    "intro": "Montjolya brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's montjolya, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Montjolya brittonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
