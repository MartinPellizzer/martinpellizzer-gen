It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves that are alternate along the stem. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by insects. Melanthium japonicum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
