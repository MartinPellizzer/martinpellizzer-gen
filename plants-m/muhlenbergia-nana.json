    "intro": "Muhlenbergia nana, commonly known as dwarf muhlenbergia, is a compact, clump-forming grass native to the southeastern United States. It features fine, silver-gray blades that are typically less than 10 inches tall, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant produces delicate, feathery plumes in late summer, adding ornamental value to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia nana is also noted for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry, rocky areas."
