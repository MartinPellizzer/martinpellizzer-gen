It belongs to the Aroid family, which includes plants like the peace lily and philodendron. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its common name. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
