It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in early spring and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
