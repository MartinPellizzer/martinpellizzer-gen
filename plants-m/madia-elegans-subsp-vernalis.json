    "intro": "Madia elegans subsp. vernalis, commonly known as the spring madia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Madia elegans subsp. vernalis is often found in California and adjacent states, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments."
