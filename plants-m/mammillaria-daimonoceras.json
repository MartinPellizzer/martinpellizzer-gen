    "intro": "Mammillaria daimonoceras, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
