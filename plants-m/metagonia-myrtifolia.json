    "intro": "Metagonia myrtifolia, commonly known as the coastal myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils near the coast. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a glossy appearance, while its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. Metagonia myrtifolia is well adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh coastal environments."
