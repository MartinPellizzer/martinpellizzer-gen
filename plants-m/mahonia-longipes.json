It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and compound leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Mahonia longipes thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a popular choice for landscape design in suitable climates."
