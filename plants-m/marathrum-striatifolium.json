It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are distinctly striated or striped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
