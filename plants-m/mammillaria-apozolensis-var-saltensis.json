    "intro": "Mammillaria apozolensis var. saltensis, commonly known as the Salt Valley mammillaria, is a small cactus native to the Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
