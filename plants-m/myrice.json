    "intro": "Myrice, commonly known as *Oryza sativa*, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia and is the primary source of rice. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and panicle-shaped inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces grains that are enclosed in a hull, which is removed during processing to reveal the edible endosperm. Myrice thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring warm temperatures and abundant water for optimal growth. Its cultivation has a significant impact on global agriculture and food security."
