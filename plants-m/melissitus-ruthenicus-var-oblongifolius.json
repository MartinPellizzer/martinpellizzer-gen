    "intro": "Melissitus ruthenicus var. oblongifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf melissitus, is a rare variant of the melissitus species native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, broad leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland understories and damp meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
