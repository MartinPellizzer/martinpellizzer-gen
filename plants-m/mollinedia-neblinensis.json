    "intro": "Mollinedia neblinensis, commonly known as the misty mollinedia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often at high altitudes. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in tropical ecosystems."
