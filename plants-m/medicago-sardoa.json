    "intro": "Medicago sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian medick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats, with small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. The plant has small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
