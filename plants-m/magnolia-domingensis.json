    "intro": "Magnolia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican magnolia, is a rare and striking species native to the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with thick, dark green leaves. Its flowers are composed of numerous petal-like structures and are pollinated primarily by insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
