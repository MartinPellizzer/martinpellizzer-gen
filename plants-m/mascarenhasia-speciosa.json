    "intro": "Mascarenhasia speciosa, commonly known as the Mascarene starflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal and limestone habitats. The plant features showy, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the arid conditions of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
