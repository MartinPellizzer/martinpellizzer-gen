    "intro": "Miconia pseudorubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its ornamental value has led to its introduction in some parts of the world, though it can be invasive in certain environments. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions, making it a common undergrowth plant in humid forests."
