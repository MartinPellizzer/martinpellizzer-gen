    "intro": "Maxillaria cryptocentroides, commonly known as the chocolate orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals that resemble chocolate in appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters, often during the late summer and early fall. The botanical structure of Maxillaria cryptocentroides includes a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less hospitable conditions."
