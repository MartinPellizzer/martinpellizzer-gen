    "intro": "Myristica cookii, commonly known as the Cook's nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Moluccas and other parts of Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers and develops unique, kidney-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. Its botanical features include aromatic leaves and a complex chemical composition that contributes to its medicinal and culinary uses. However, it is less commercially valuable than its more famous relative, the nutmeg tree."
