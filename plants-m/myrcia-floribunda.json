    "intro": "Myrcia floribunda, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but considered toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Myrcia floribunda is also known for its aromatic leaves, which have been used in traditional medicine."
