It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
