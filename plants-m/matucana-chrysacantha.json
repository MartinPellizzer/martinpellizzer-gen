    "intro": "Matucana chrysacantha, commonly known as the golden matucana, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, yellow-orange inflorescence that stands out against its dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often adorned with small, white or green flowers that bloom sequentially along the central stem. Matucana chrysacantha is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
