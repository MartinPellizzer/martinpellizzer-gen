    "intro": "Malaxis javesiae subsp. ramirezii, commonly known as the Ramirez's lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in a loose raceme. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It has a short rhizome and produces small, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
