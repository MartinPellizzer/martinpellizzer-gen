    "intro": "Mediocalcar angustum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Mediocalcar angustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
