    "intro": "Microlicia alvarengae, commonly known as the Alvar\u00e9ngas microlicia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the humid forests of Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microlicia alvarengae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
