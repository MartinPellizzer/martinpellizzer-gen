    "intro": "Miconia maguirei, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and coastal areas. It has a woody stem and can grow as a shrub or small tree. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, raising concerns about its potential invasive nature."
