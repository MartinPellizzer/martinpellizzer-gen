    "intro": "Melancranis bulbosa, commonly known as the purple bulbous orchid, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its fleshy, bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss. Melancranis bulbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and ample sunlight."
