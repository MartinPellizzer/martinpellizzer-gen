    "intro": "Microlepia trapeziformis var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid horse-tail fern, is a variant of the microlepia genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a fern characterized by its dense, creeping rhizomes and small, narrow, lanceolate leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive rhomboid shape in cross-section. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
