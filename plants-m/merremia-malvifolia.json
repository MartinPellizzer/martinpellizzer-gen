    "intro": "Merremia malvifolia, commonly known as the white morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oblong seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
