    "intro": "Macrostylis barbata, commonly known as the hairy-styled grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, with the lower bracts being notably hairy, giving it its common name. Macrostylis barbata is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native environment."
