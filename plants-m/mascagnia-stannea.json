    "intro": "Mascagnia stannea, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Due to its drought tolerance and unique blooming pattern, it is of interest in both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
