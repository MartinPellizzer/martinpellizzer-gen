    "intro": "Minuartia obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leafed rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented stems. The plant typically has dark green, ovate to elliptic leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Minuartia obtusiloba plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
