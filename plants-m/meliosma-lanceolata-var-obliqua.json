    "intro": "Meliosma lanceolata var. obliqua, commonly known as the oblique meliosma, is a rare flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly twisted. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate species with conservation concerns."
