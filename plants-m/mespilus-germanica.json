    "intro": "Mespilus germanica, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when partially ripe, as they continue to soften and develop flavor after picking. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its fruit has a distinctive, bumpy surface. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
