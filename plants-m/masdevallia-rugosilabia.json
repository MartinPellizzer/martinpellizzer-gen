    "intro": "Masdevallia rugosilabia, commonly known as the wrinkled labia masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often hairy foliage and striking, spurred flowers that come in a range of colors including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its pseudobulbs are segmented and support the plant's growth, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
