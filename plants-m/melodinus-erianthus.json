    "intro": "Melodinus erianthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Melodinus erianthus is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
