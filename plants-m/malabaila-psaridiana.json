It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in the spring, making it a distinctive feature of the Cypriot flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
