It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
