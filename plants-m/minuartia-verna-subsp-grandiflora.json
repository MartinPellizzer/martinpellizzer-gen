It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh climates, making it a resilient member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
