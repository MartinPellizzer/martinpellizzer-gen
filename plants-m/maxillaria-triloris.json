    "intro": "Maxillaria triloris, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The flowers typically have three lobes, giving the plant its common name, and are often pale yellow or greenish-white with red or purple markings. The plant prefers warm, humid conditions and is often grown as a houseplant or in greenhouses. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in shaded environments."
