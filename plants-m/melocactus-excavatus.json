    "intro": "Melocactus excavatus, commonly known as the Mexican hollow cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months, typically at night. Its unique feature is the presence of a deep, central depression or hollow on the stem, which gives it its scientific name. Melocactus excavatus is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water requirements."
