    "intro": "Maytenus phyllanthoides var. phyllanthoides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It features simple, opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in certain regions."
