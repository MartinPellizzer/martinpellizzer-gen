    "intro": "Medicago contorta, commonly known as narrowleaf clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a slight curl. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and pastures. Medicago contorta is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological settings."
