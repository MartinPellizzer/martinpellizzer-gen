    "intro": "Mappianthus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly mappianthus, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, soft, white tomentose (fuzzy) covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
