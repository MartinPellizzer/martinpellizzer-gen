    "intro": "Marumia verrucosa, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Marumia verrucosa is also valued for its latex, which has been used in various industrial applications."
