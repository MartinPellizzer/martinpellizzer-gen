    "intro": "Myosotis radicans, commonly known as the trailing forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist ground. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and slightly hairy, often found in clusters along the stems. Myosotis radicans thrives in damp, shady environments and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value."
