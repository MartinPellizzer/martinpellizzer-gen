    "intro": "Malvastrum marrubioides var. viscidum, commonly known as sticky marrubioid mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for xeriscaping in arid regions."
