It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
