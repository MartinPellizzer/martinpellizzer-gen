    "intro": "Milium virgatum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, silver-gray foliage that resembles the ears of a mouse, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valued addition to native plant gardens."
