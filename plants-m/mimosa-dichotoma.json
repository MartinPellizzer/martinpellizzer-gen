    "intro": "Mimosa dichotoma, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and educational settings. Its unique movements and rapid response to stimuli have made it a subject of scientific interest and a symbol of sensitivity in various cultures."
