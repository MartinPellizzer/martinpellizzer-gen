    "intro": "Mercurialis elliptica var. leiogyna, commonly known as the smoothleaf mercury plant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its smooth, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
