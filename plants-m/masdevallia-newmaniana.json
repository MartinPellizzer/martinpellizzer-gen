    "intro": "Masdevallia newmaniana, commonly known as the Newman's masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful inflorescences and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, cool, and humid environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small to medium-sized, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that enhances its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in cultivation."
