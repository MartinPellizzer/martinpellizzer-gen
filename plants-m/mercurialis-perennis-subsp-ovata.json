    "intro": "Mercurialis perennis subsp. ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf mercury. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and its role in supporting local insect populations."
