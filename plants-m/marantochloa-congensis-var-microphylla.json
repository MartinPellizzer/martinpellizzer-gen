It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces delicate, spadix-like inflorescences that are often surrounded by a hooded bract. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, fertile soil. Due to its unique appearance and manageable size, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
