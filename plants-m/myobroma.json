    "intro": "Myobroma, commonly known as the \"stinging nettle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. These plants are characterized by their hollow, hairless stems and leaves with stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. Myobroma species are typically herbaceous, often growing in moist, shady environments such as forests and wetlands. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as a food source when cooked."
