    "intro": "Microlepia sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim microlepia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. Its sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Microlepia sikkimensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at moderate elevations."
