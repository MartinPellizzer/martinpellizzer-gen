    "intro": "Mascarenhasia parvifolia, commonly known as the Mascarene dwarf lily, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal and limestone habitats. The plant features small, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
