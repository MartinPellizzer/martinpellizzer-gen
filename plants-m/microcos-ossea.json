    "intro": "Microcos ossea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-green, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. Microcos ossea is a perennial that thrives in full sun and is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value. Its unique appearance and ability to tolerate salt spray make it a distinctive addition to maritime landscapes."
