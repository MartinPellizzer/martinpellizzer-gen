    "intro": "Mimulus breweri, commonly known as the San Diego monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southern California. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, thriving in areas with mild, coastal climates. Mimulus breweri is a herbaceous perennial that often forms dense clusters, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and development, it is considered a rare and endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
