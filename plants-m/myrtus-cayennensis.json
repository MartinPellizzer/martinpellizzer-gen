    "intro": "Myrtus cayennensis, commonly known as the West Indian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features fragrant, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to reddish-brown berries, which are edible but typically used in culinary applications. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Myrtus cayennensis is valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
