    "intro": "Mentzelia multiflora var. longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
