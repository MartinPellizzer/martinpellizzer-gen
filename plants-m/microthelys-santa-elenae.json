    "intro": "Microthelys santa-elenae, commonly known as the Santa Elena microthelys, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Santa Elena in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests or near freshwater sources. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying endemic species. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable."
