It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, white or pale purple flowers that appear in late spring. The tree produces long, cylindrical pods that split open to release its winged seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a rich history in traditional medicine. The varietal form 'incisa' is distinguished by its deeply lobed leaves, adding to its unique botanical appearance."
