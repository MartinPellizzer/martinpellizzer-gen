It belongs to the family Rosaceae, which includes roses, apples, and strawberries, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as pomes, similar to those of the apple genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
