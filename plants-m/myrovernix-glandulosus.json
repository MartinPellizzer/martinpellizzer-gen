    "intro": "Myrovernix glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky glandular fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is distinguished by its glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which aids in moisture retention and protection against herbivores. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and the leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular trichomes. This species thrives in humid environments and is often found growing in shaded, moist areas of forests."
