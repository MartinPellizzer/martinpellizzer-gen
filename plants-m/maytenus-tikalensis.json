    "intro": "Maytenus tikalensis, commonly known as the Tikal tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize and Guatemala. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in lowland rainforests. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. The Tikal tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and forest structure."
