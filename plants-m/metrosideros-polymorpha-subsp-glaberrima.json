    "intro": "Metrosideros polymorpha subsp. glaberrima, commonly known as the Koa 'Hawaiian White' or Koa 'White', is a rare subspecies of the native Hawaiian tree. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is endemic to the island of Hawai'i and is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
