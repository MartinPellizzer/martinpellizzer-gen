    "intro": "Morocarpus affinis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it retain water in dry environments. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Morocarpus affinis is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
