    "intro": "Memecylon wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan memecylon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Memecylon wallichii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native ecosystems."
