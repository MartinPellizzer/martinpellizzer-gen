    "intro": "Malaxis seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles Malaxis, is a rare orchid native to the Seychelles archipelago. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
