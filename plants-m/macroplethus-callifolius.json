    "intro": "Macroplethus callifolius, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a tendency to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
