It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Melica cepacea is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
