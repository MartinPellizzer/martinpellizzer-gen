    "intro": "Mikania nitidula, commonly known as the velvetleaf or creeping oxeye, is a tropical and subtropical flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by white or pale green ray florets. Mikania nitidula is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It is also known for its ability to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in many regions."
