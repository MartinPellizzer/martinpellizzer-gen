    "intro": "Myrica darrisii, commonly known as the Darrisii wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Myricaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by waxy, cone-like fruits. Myrica darrisii thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
