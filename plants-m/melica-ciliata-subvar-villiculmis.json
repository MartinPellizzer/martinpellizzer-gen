    "intro": "Melica ciliata subvar. villiculmis, commonly known as the silky beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and compact inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
