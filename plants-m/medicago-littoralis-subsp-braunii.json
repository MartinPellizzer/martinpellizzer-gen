    "intro": "Medicago littoralis subsp. braunii, commonly known as the coastal medic, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important species for soil enrichment in coastal ecosystems."
