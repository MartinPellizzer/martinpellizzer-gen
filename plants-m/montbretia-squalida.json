    "intro": "Montbretia squalida, commonly known as the yellow oxlip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive red or orange center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
