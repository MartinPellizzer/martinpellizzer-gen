    "intro": "Maerua trichocarpa, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are succulent and can store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Maerua trichocarpa is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
