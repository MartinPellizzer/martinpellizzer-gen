    "intro": "Miconia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can vary in size and shape depending on the environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Miconia heterophylla is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
