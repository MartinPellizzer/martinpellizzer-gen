    "intro": "Mimosa meticulosa f. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf sensitive plant, is a cultivar of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait caused by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its unique behavior and aesthetic appeal make it a fascinating addition to botanical collections."
