    "intro": "Miconia emarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or false miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that contain numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
