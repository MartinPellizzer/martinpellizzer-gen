    "intro": "Mentha perpedicellata, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has square stems and opposite leaves, typical of the mint family, Lamiaceae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its essential oils, like those of other mints, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
