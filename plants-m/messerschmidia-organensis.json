It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has small, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It blooms primarily in the spring and is often found in rocky soils and sandy habitats. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and unique species within its ecosystem."
