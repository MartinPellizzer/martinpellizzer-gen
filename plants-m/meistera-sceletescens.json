    "intro": "Meistera sceletescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, making it a unique example of an epiphytic species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Meistera sceletescens is considered an endangered species."
