It is native to the Himalayan region and parts of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Mappa wallichii is often found in forest understories and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
