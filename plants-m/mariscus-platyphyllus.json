    "intro": "Mariscus platyphyllus, commonly known as the flat-leaf mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
