    "intro": "Mandevilla tricolor, commonly known as the tri-color mandevilla, is a vigorous climbing plant native to South America. It produces vibrant, trifoliate flowers in shades of red, yellow, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and can grow up to 20 feet in length if supported properly. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil. Mandevilla tricolor is popular in gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
