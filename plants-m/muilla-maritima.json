    "intro": "Muilla maritima, commonly known as the coastal muilla, is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and pale yellow, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Muilla maritima is valued for its resilience and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental and drought-tolerant qualities."
