    "intro": "Mucuna suberosa, commonly known as the hairy urd or velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with prominent leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in agricultural systems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage crop and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
