    "intro": "Melandrium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf catchfly, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and features delicate, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Melandrium pumilum is also known for its ability to self-seed, contributing to its widespread distribution."
