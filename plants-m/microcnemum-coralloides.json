    "intro": "Microcnemum coralloides, commonly known as the coral-like cushion plant, is a low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It forms dense, compact cushions that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, appearing in clusters during the rainy season. Microcnemum coralloides is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking species in its habitat."
