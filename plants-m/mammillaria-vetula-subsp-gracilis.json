It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, white, woolly areoles that bear clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant has small, spineless tubercles and produces pale green, ribbed stems that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This subspecies is prized for its compact size and ornamental appeal in succulent collections."
