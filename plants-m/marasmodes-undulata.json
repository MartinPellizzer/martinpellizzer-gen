It is characterized by its delicate, wavy-edged leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of rainforests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil. Marasmodes undulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique foliage structure."
