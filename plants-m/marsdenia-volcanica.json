    "intro": "Marsdenia volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Marsdenia volcanica is often found growing in rocky or volcanic soils, reflecting its name's origin."
