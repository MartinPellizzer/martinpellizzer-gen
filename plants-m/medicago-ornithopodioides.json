    "intro": "Medicago ornithopodioides, commonly known as the desert clover, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant has deep taproots that allow it to survive in dry conditions and fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to improve soil fertility."
