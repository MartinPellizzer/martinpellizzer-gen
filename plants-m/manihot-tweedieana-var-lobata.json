    "intro": "Manihot tweedieana var. lobata, commonly known as the swamp arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features a rhizomatous root system that produces starchy tubers, which are historically used as a food source. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy environments, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. This variant is closely related to other Manihot species, which are known for their economic and nutritional value."
