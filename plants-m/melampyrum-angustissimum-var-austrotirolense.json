    "intro": "Melampyrum angustissimum var. austrotirolense, commonly known as the narrowleaf burning bush, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges, and it blooms in late summer with reddish or orange flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range."
