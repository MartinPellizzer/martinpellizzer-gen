    "intro": "Meistera vermana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing the seeds. Meistera vermana thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Its rapid growth and aggressive spreading make it a potential invasive species in some regions."
