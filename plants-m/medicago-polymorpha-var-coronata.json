    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. coronata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
