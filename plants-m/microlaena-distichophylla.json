    "intro": "Microlaena distichophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved microlaena, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 millimeters wide. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly packed, giving it a dense appearance. Microlaena distichophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
