    "intro": "Mitostylis procumbens var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune lichen, is a specialized plant adapted to arid and coastal environments. It thrives in sandy soils, often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing the sand. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. It is a member of the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
