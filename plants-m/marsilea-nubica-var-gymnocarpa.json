    "intro": "Marsilea nubica var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the African water clover, is a aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, floating leaves that are divided into four segments, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in muddy or nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems and a subject of study in botany and ecology."
