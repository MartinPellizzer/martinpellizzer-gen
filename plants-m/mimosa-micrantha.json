It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, and it blooms with clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. Mimosa micrantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it a common ornamental and ecological plant in its native range."
