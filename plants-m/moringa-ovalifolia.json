    "intro": "Moringa ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf moringa, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are often trifoliate, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain edible seeds and a nutrient-rich seed pulp. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species for cultivation in challenging climates. Moringa ovalifolia is valued for its nutritional properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various health benefits."
