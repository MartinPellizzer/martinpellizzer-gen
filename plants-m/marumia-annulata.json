    "intro": "Marumia annulata, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its helical growth pattern, where the stems twist around supporting structures in a spiral manner. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often heart-shaped, with a smooth texture. Marumia annulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
