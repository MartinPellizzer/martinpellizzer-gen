    "intro": "Miconia rubiginosa var. glabrior, commonly known as the glossy miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that ripens to a deep red or orange color. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
