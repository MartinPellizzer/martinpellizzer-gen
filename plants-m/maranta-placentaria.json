    "intro": "Maranta placentaria, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Amazon, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the forest floor, forming dense mats. Due to its unique appearance and cultural significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded gardens."
