    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. tibetana, commonly known as Tibetan spearmint, is a variant of the spearmint species native to high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its aromatic properties, it is occasionally used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
