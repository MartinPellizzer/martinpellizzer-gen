It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a robust, vine-like stem that requires support as it climbs. Its foliage is often a deep green, with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance."
