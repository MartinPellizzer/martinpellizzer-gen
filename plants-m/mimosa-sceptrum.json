    "intro": "Mimosa sceptrum, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa sceptrum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
