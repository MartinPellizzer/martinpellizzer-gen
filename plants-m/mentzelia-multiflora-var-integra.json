    "intro": "Mentzelia multiflora var. integra, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to arid environments, reducing water loss through transpiration. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Mentzelia multiflora var. integra is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert and semi-desert regions."
