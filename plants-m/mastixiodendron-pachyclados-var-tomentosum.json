    "intro": "Mastixiodendron pachyclados var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly mastix tree, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree with dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange in color. Its leaves are characterized by their thick, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant is adapted to coastal and rocky environments, making it a hardy species with ornamental value in gardens."
