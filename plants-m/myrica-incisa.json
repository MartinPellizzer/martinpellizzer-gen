    "intro": "Myrica incisa, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrica incisa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. It is also valued for its aromatic wood and historical use in traditional medicine."
