    "intro": "Misanteca cervantesii, commonly known as the Cervantes's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is native to certain regions of Central America and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
