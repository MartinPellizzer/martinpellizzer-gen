    "intro": "Melampyrum pseudoarvense, commonly known as false toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface."
