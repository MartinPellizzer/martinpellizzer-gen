    "intro": "Marathrum pauciflorum var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and summer. The plant typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
