    "intro": "Mariscus umbellatus var. microstachys, commonly known as the small-stalked marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers on slender stems. The species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other forms of Mariscus umbellatus."
