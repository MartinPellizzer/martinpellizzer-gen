    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. pegaia, commonly known as the Siberian mint, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong minty scent and making it useful in traditional medicine. This variety is often used for its cooling properties and is adapted to grow in moist, temperate climates."
