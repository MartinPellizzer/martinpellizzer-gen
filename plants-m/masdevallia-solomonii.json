    "intro": "Masdevallia solomonii, commonly known as the Solomon's masdevallia, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically produces a single, showy flower per stem, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is a prized species among orchid enthusiasts."
