It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
