    "intro": "Medicago mollissima, commonly known as velvet brome, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish to reddish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Velvet brome is valued for its forage quality and its ability to stabilize soil in agricultural settings."
