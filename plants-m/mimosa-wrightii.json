    "intro": "Mimosa wrightii, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to light and touch. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Mimosa wrightii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
