    "intro": "Mammillaria crucigera var. tlalocii, commonly known as the Tlaloc's mammillaria, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, which give it a distinctive, almost star-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
