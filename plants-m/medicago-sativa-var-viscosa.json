    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a variant of the common vetch that is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and stems. It is a leguminous plant that belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its small, yellow flowers appear in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The sticky hairs on its leaves and stems are a distinguishing feature that helps in identifying this plant."
