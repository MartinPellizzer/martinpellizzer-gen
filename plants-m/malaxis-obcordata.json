    "intro": "Malaxis obcordata, commonly known as the heartleaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, pendulous flowers that often have a distinctive purple or violet coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in the understory of tropical or subtropical woodlands. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, which are attracted by the plant's fragrant nectar. Malaxis obcordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
