    "intro": "Miconia namandensis, commonly known as the Namand\u00e9 miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
