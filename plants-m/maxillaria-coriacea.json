    "intro": "Maxillaria coriacea, commonly known as the rough maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves that are covered in a thick, waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive hairy texture on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria coriacea is appreciated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
