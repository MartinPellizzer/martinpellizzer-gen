    "intro": "Munroa andina, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Munroa andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
