    "intro": "Melicho humilis, commonly known as the lowland melich, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
