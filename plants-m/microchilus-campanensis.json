    "intro": "Microchilus campanensis, commonly known as the bell-shaped orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, clustered roots that help it anchor in rocky or forested soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
