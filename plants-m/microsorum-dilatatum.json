    "intro": "Microsorum dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are broad and oval in shape, often with a waxy surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Microsorum dilatatum is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to improve water quality."
