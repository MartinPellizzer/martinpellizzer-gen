    "intro": "Miconia marginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia marginata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers."
