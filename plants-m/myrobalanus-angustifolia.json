    "intro": "Myrobalanus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chequerbush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy drupes that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Myrobalanus angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
