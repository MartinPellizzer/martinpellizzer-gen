    "intro": "Medusandra, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique and rare plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, bell-shaped flowers that resemble jellyfish, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its delicate, waxy petals that emit a faint, sweet fragrance at night. Medusandra thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
