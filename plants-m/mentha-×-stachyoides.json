    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 stachyoides, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, arranged in whorls along the stem. It is known for its strong aromatic properties, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone, which is responsible for its intoxicating effect on cats. Mentha \u00d7 stachyoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of essential oils."
