It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it the \"pubescent\" designation. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
