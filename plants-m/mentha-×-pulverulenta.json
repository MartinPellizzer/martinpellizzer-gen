    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 pulverulenta, commonly known as peppergrass mint, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to spread readily, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
