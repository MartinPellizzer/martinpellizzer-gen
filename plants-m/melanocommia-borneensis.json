    "intro": "Melanocommia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean melanocommia, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often found in the understory of dense tropical vegetation. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, contributing to its role in seed dispersal within its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
