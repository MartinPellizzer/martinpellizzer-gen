    "intro": "Myrtus bullata, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with a fragrant, resinous scent. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Myrtus bullata is often used in hedges and as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth and aromatic qualities."
