    "intro": "Myrtus tozerii, commonly known as the Socotra myrtle, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to the unique climate of Socotra. Its fruit is a small, dark blue drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the island's unique ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
