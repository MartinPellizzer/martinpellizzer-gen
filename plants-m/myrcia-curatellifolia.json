    "intro": "Myrcia curatellifolia, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a strong, peppery taste. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Myrcia curatellifolia is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
