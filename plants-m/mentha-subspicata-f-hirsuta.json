    "intro": "Mentha subspicata f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mint, is a variant of the spearmint species. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and a strong, aromatic scent. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture due to the dense pubescence. The flowers are small, tubular, and usually violet or purple in color, arranged in spikes."
