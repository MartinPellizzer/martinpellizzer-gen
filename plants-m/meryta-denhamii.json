    "intro": "Meryta denhamii, commonly known as Denham's meryta, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, palm-like appearance with compound leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing in shaded, moist areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meryta denhamii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
