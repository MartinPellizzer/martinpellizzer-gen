    "intro": "Melaleuca bracteosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, strap-like leaves. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The species is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
