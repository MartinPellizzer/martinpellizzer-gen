    "intro": "Myristica brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant, reddish-brown flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, aromatic shell. Myristica brachypoda is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to nutmeg. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
