    "intro": "Myrtus montana, commonly known as the mountain myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. Myrtus montana is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
