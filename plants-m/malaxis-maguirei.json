    "intro": "Malaxis maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's orchid, is a rare and delicate terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as pine forests and hardwood hammocks. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a small, greenish-white flower with a distinctive hooded lip. It is known for its low-growing habit and is often found in association with other rare orchid species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
