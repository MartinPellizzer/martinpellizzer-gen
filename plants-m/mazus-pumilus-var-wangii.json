    "intro": "Mazus pumilus var. wangii, commonly known as the dwarf mazus, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
