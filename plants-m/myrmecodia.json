    "intro": "Myrmecodia, commonly known as the ant plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique hollow, tree-like structures that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's hollow stems, called \"cavities,\" are formed by the fusion of leaf bases and are often colonized by colonies of ants. Myrmecodia species are native to Southeast Asia and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on their symbiotic relationship with ants for survival."
