    "intro": "Mondo japonicum var. major, commonly known as Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Japan. It features dense, dark green, strap-shaped leaves that form a thick carpet on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden settings."
