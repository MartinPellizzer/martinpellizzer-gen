    "intro": "Micromeria diffusa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Micromeria diffusa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
