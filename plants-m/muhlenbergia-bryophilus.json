    "intro": "Muhlenbergia bryophilus, commonly known as the moss-feeding muhlenbergia, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps it retain moisture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, feathery flowers. This grass is particularly adapted to grow in association with mosses, forming a unique ecological relationship."
