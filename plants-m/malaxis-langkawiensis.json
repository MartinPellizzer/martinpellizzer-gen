    "intro": "Malaxis langkawiensis, commonly known as the Langkawi Malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the island of Langkawi in Malaysia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with fleshy, ovate leaves that are dark green in color. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in a loose spike, often with a faintly fragrant aroma. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
