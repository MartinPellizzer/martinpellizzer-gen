    "intro": "Microchirita involucrata var. involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a soft, pubescent texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types make it a common weed in agricultural settings. The species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can influence soil fertility in its native habitats."
