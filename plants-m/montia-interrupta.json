    "intro": "Montia interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted watercress, is a small flowering plant native to moist, rocky habitats in western North America. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, alternate leaves and small white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wet environments such as stream banks and meadows, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
