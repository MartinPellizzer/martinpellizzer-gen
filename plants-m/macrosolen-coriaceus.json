    "intro": "Macrosolen coriaceus, commonly known as the roughleaf macrostigma, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like stems and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. Macrosolen coriaceus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
