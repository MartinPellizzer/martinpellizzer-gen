    "intro": "Mimosa barbigera, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its sensitive response to touch, causing the leaves to fold when disturbed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
