    "intro": "Malacothamnus, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and northern Mexico. These plants are typically found in rocky, arid, or semi-arid environments, often growing in crevices or on slopes. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-gray leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The genus includes several species, such as Malacothamnus ciliatus and Malacothamnus neomexicanus, which are adapted to harsh, dry conditions. The plants have a compact growth form and are often used in native plant gardens due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
