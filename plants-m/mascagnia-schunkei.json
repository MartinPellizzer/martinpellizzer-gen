    "intro": "Mascagnia schunkei, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils with minimal water availability."
