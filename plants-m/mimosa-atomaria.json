    "intro": "Mimosa atomaria, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa atomaria is often grown as a ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movement and attractive foliage."
