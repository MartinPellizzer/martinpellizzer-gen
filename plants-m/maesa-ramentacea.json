It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its small, white or pink flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely cultivated.
