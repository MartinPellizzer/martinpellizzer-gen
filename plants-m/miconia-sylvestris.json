    "intro": "Miconia sylvestris, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions as a decorative plant."
