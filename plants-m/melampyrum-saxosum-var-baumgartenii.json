    "intro": "Melampyrum saxosum var. baumgartenii, commonly known as the saxifrage touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
