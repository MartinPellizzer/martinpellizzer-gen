It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring. It is adapted to sandy or loamy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
