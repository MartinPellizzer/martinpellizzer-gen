    "intro": "Mimosa lagunensis, commonly known as the Guanabara mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and mangrove areas, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments."
