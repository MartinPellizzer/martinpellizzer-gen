    "intro": "Macrolobium, commonly known as the giant poinciana, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, showy, palmate leaves. The plants produce striking clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. Macrolobium species are typically shrubs or small trees, with compound leaves that can reach several feet in diameter. These plants are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
