    "intro": "Myoxanthus octomerioides, commonly known as the golden starbursts, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling starbursts, and are particularly prominent in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly rough texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Myoxanthus octomerioides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
