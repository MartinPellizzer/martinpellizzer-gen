    "intro": "Mesosphaerum simplex, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in sandy or gravelly soils. Mesosphaerum simplex is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as roadsides and rocky outcrops."
