    "intro": "Maxillaria pantherina, commonly known as the Panther Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety flowers that resemble panthers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of multiple flowers arranged in a spike, with vividly colored petals and a distinctive lip. Maxillaria pantherina thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining potting mix for optimal growth."
