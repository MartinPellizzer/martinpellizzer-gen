    "intro": "Myricaria germanica subsp. germanica, commonly known as the German sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe. It is characterized by its linear, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
