It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
