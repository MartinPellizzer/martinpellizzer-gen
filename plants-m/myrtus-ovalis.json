    "intro": "Myrtus ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and aromatic, with a distinctively sweet, spicy scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. Myrtus ovalis is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has historical uses in perfumery and traditional medicine."
