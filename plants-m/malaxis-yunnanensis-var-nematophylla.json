    "intro": "Malaxis yunnanensis var. nematophylla, commonly known as the Yunnan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks, and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
