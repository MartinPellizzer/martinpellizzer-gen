    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron subtrigonum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It has a woody stem and is often found growing in coastal or subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
