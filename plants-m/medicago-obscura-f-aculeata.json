    "intro": "Medicago obscura f. aculeata, commonly known as the spiny medick, is a variant of the medick plant characterized by its distinctive spiny foliage. It is a low-growing perennial forage plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along field edges. Its spiny leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores, making it a resilient and adaptive species."
