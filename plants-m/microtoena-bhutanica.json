    "intro": "Microtoena bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese microtoena, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly Bhutan. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in mountain forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
