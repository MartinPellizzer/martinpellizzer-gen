The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in temperate to subarctic environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions, and it is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Medicago sibirica is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
