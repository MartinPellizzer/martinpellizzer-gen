    "intro": "Monotoca, commonly known as the \"false lily,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the family Iridaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, often blue or violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is native to regions of southern Africa. Monotoca thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
