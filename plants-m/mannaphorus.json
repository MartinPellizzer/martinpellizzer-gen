    "intro": "Mannaphorus, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The flowers are pollinated by insects and produce small, round fruits that contain seeds."
