It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its showy, orange-red calyces that enclose the small, edible fruits. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often consumed fresh or used in jams and beverages. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.
