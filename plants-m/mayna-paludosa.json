    "intro": "Mayna paludosa, commonly known as marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Mayna paludosa thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
