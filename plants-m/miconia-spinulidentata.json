    "intro": "Miconia spinulidentata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to manage in natural habitats."
