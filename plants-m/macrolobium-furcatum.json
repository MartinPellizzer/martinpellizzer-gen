    "intro": "Macrolobium furcatum, commonly known as the split-leaf senna, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are divided into several lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds. Macrolobium furcatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine."
