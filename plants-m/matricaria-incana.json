    "intro": "Matricaria incana, commonly known as goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is an annual or biennial herb that thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. Its flowers produce tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Matricaria incana is also used in traditional medicine for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
