    "intro": "Maranta ovata, commonly known as the upright arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, with a waxy texture and a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red or orange berries containing tiny seeds. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy root vegetable, similar to yams or cassava. Maranta ovata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
