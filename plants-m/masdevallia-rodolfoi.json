    "intro": "Masdevallia rodolfoi, commonly known as the Rodolfo's masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces intricate, often colorful flowers with a unique, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its foliage consists of fleshy, dark green leaves that help it conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
