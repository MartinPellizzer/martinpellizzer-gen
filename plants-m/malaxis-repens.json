    "intro": "Malaxis repens, commonly known as the creeping malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often lack a distinct scent. It is characterized by its unique morphology and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids."
