    "intro": "Miconia aristata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Miconia aristata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
