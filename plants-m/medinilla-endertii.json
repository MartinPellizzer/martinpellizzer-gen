This evergreen shrub is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that resemble small, clustered tangerines.

Medinilla endertii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to bloom throughout the year."
