    "intro": "Miconia cristulata, commonly known as the featherleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble feathers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Miconia cristulata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
