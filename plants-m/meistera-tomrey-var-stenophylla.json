    "intro": "Meistera tomrey var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf meistera, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
