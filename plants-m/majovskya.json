    "intro": "Majovskya, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Majovskya species typically produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm climates."
