    "intro": "Melampyrum paradoxum, commonly known as cow parsley or yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy, with a distinctive, somewhat triangular shape. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
