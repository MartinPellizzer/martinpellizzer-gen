It is characterized by its dark purple to black leaves and aromatic, slightly minty scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Mentha atrata is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
