    "intro": "Mespilus silvestris, commonly known as the wild medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, rough, reddish bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, subacid berries that ripen in the fall, though they are often used in cooking and traditional medicine. Mespilus silvestris is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its historical use in horticulture and landscape design."
