    "intro": "Marginaria collinsii, commonly known as Collins' marginaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features slender, branching stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its coastal habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
