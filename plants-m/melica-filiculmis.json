    "intro": "Melica filiculmis, commonly known as the feather-leaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with fine, feathery hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Melica filiculmis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
