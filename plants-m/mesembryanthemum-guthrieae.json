    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum guthrieae, commonly known as the Guthrie's ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, often blooming in response to morning dew. It is a low-growing plant with a spreading habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes. Mesembryanthemum guthrieae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
