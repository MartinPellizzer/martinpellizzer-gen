    "intro": "Mikania punctata, commonly known as the punctate morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
