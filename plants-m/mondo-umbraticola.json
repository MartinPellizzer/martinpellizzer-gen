    "intro": "Mondo umbraticola, commonly known as the shade-loving mondo grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the forests of East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact mat, typically ranging from 10 to 15 centimeters in height. The leaves are narrow, dark green, and often have a slightly glossy appearance, which helps the plant thrive in low-light conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This plant is well-suited for shaded garden beds and is often used as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
