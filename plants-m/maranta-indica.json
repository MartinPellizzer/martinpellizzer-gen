    "intro": "Maranta indica, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, ornamental leaves that fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is prized for its vibrant foliage, which can range from deep green to red and purple hues. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maranta indica is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
