It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are often succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions.
