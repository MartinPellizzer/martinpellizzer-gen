    "intro": "Miconia chartacea var. miqueliana, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. Its fruit is a fleshy, three-lobed capsule that turns red when mature. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
