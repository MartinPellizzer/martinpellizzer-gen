    "intro": "Mimulus reifschneiderae, commonly known as the Reifschneider's monkeyflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which are typically spurred and bilaterally symmetrical. The plant grows in rocky, alpine environments, often in areas with high levels of solar radiation. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. Mimulus reifschneiderae is adapted to cold, dry conditions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its mountainous habitat."
