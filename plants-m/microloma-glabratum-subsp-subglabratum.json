    "intro": "Microloma glabratum subsp. subglabratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved microloma, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
