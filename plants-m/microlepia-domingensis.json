    "intro": "Microlepia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica and other nearby islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, facilitating its reproductive cycle. Microlepia domingensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
