    "intro": "Myrica pavonis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue, berry-like drupes. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The glandular hairs on its leaves and stems contribute to its unique botanical features and ecological adaptations."
