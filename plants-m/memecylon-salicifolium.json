    "intro": "Memecylon salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf memecylon, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are typically opposite and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four stamens and a two-lobed pistil, typical of the genus Memecylon. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Memecylon salicifolium is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
