    "intro": "Mascagnia divaricata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Mascagnia divaricata is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
