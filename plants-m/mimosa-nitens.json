    "intro": "Mimosa nitens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
