    "intro": "Melica cappadocica, commonly known as Cappadocian grass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically hairless or sparsely hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Melica cappadocica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
