    "intro": "Mespilus prunifolia, commonly known as the European whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, round fruits known as whiteberries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in woodland habitats."
