    "intro": "Mammillaria gracilis var. fragilis, commonly known as the fragile hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in small, white tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its fragility, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions to prevent damage."
