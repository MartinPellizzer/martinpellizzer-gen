It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing traits with other mint species like its aromatic oils and square stems.
