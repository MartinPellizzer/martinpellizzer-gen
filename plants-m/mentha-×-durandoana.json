It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and its distinctive, pineapple-like fragrance. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and often have a silvery underside. Mentha \u00d7 durandoana is commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and as a source of essential oils."
