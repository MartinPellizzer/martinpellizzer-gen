    "intro": "Mikania convolvulacea, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a fast-growing vine native to the Americas. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and can spread aggressively, often forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
