    "intro": "Maihuenia albolanata f. viridulispina, commonly known as the green-spined mayhuenia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its succulent, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in a distinctive greenish-white cuticle, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, lanceolate, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to the arid and high-altitude environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
