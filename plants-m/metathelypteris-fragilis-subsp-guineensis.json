    "intro": "Metathelypteris fragilis subsp. guineensis, commonly known as the Guinean brittle fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its fronds are often fragile and may have a soft, leathery texture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
