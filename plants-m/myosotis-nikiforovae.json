    "intro": "Myosotis nikiforovae, commonly known as the Nikiforov's forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
