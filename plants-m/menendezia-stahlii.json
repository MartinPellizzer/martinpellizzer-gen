    "intro": "Menendezia stahlii, commonly known as the Stahli's menendezia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Menendezia stahlii is considered a species of conservation concern."
