    "intro": "Mimosa brachycarpoides, commonly known as the small-fruit mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its native habitat. Mimosa brachycarpoides is often found in sandy or disturbed soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts."
