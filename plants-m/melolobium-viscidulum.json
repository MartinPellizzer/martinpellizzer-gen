    "intro": "Melolobium viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky melolobium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which help in deterring herbivores. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish flowers. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying plant defense mechanisms and ecological resilience."
