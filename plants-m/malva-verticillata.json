    "intro": "Malva verticillata, commonly known as the common mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves arranged in a whorl at the nodes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its hairy stems and leaves are characteristic of the Malvaceae family, and it is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and fields. Malva verticillata is also known for its mucilage-rich leaves, which have been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
