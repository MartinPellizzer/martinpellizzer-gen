    "intro": "Myriopteris microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Myriopteris microphylla is notable for its intricate leaf structure and its role in forest understory ecosystems."
