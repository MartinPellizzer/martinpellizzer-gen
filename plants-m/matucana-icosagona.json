    "intro": "Matucana icosagona, commonly known as the 20-sided cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America, particularly in countries like Venezuela and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a stout trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. Its leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern and can grow up to several meters in length. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, Matucana icosagona is considered an endangered species."
