    "intro": "Morella humilis, commonly known as the lowlander wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Morella humilis thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along the edges of marshes. Its adaptability to moist soils makes it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
