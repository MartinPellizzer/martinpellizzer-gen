    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. stagnalis, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, aromatic leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as ponds, streams, and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
