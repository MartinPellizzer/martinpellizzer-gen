    "intro": "Maximiliana argentinensis, commonly known as the Argentine rosewood, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
