    "intro": "Myrciaria longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, particularly in the state of Santa Catarina. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain several seeds. Myrciaria longipes is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though further scientific research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
