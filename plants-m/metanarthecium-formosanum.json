It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swampy areas and along riverbanks. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges."
