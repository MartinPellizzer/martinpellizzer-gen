    "intro": "Mespilus montana, commonly known as the mountain medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by unique, apple-like fruits that ripen in late summer. These fruits have a distinctive musky aroma and a firm, mealy texture when mature. Mespilus montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
