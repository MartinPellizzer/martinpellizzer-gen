    "intro": "Myoxanthus ceratothallis, commonly known as the candlestick fern, is a unique species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that resemble candlesticks, which are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced and often recurved. Myoxanthus ceratothallis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soil within deciduous forests."
