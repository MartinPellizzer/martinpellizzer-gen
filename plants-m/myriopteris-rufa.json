    "intro": "Myriopteris rufa, commonly known as the rusty cliff brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark brown, leathery fronds that are typically clustered in a rosette formation. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Myriopteris rufa is adapted to withstand drought and high sunlight exposure, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
