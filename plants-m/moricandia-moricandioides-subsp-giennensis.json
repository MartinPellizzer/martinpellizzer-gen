    "intro": "Moricandia moricandioides subsp. giennensis, commonly known as the Giennese wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, open habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to Mediterranean climates."
