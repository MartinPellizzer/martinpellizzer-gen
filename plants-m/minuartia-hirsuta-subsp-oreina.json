    "intro": "Minuartia hirsuta subsp. oreina, commonly known as the Alpine rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
