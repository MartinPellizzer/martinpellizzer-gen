    "intro": "Microtropis, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family, consists of species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. Many species produce berries that are often brightly colored, attracting various pollinators and seed dispersers. Microtropis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. They thrive in moist, shaded environments and are often found in rainforests."
