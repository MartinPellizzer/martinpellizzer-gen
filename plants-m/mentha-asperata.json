    "intro": "Mentha asperata, commonly known as rough mint, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and a strong, minty aroma. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering spikes bear small, purple or white flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Mentha asperata is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional remedies for its cooling and digestive effects."
