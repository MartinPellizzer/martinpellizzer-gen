    "intro": "Mormodes vernixioidea subsp. autanensis, commonly known as the Autan Island orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Autan in the French Southern and Antarctic Territories. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive white and purple coloration, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its restricted habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
