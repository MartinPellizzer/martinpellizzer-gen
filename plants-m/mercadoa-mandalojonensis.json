    "intro": "Mercadoa mandalojonensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, while its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
