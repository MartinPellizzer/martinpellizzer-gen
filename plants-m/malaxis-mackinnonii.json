    "intro": "Malaxis mackinnonii, commonly known as the Mackinnon's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its long, slender spikes of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, a feature common in the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
