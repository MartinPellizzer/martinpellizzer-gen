    "intro": "Mappia amamiana, commonly known as the Amami mappia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in the local ecosystem."
