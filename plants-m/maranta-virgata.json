    "intro": "Maranta virgata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaf patterns that change throughout the day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Maranta virgata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
