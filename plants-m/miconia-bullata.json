    "intro": "Miconia bullata, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that is a fleshy, berry-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions."
