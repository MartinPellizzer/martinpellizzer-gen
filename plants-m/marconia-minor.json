It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and features delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
