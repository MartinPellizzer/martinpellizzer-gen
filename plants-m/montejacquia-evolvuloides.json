    "intro": "Montejacquia evolvuloides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, which open in the morning and close by midday. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or trailing, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Montejacquia evolvuloides is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, known for its climbing or trailing vines."
