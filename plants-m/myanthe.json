    "intro": "Myanthe, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Myanthe species produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, similar to those of true dandelions. These plants are often considered weeds but can be found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils."
