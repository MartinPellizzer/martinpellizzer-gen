    "intro": "Malva limensis, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Malva limensis is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient conditions and is drought-tolerant."
