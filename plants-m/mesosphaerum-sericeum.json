The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
