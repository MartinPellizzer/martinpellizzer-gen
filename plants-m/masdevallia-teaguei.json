    "intro": "Masdevallia teaguei, commonly known as the Teague's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flower structures with elongated petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as a small epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to the humid, shaded conditions of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicately balanced species within its ecosystem."
