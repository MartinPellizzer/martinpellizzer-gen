    "intro": "Monteverdia manabiensis, commonly known as the Manabi monteverdia, is a climbing plant native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical study remains limited. Monteverdia manabiensis is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
