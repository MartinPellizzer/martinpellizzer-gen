The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Mentha serbica is valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain essential oils used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
