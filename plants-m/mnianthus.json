It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, lantern-shaped pods that enclose the seeds. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, pea-like flowers in clusters. Mnianthus species are native to Asia, particularly China, and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
