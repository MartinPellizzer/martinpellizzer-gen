    "intro": "Macropsychanthus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored ghost flower, is a rare and unique member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and receives minimal rainfall. The plant is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that range from white to pink, creating a visually stunning contrast. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
