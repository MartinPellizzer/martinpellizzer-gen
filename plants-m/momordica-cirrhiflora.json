    "intro": "Momordica cirrhiflora, commonly known as the horned cucumber, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to elongated, warty fruits resembling small cucumbers. Its fruit is edible when mature, though it has a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins. The plant is often cultivated for its unique appearance and culinary uses in certain regions."
