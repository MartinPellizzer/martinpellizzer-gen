    "intro": "Macrosiphonia dulcis, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a unique member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, especially when dried. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome system allows it to spread slowly through underground growth, forming dense clusters. The leaves are usually bi-lobed and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
