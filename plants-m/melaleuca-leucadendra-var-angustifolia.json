    "intro": "Melaleuca leucadendra var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. This variety is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
