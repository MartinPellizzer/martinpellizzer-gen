    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. piperascens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf field mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, slightly hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. This variety is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its cooling and digestive effects."
