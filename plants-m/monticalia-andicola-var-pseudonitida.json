    "intro": "Monticalia andicola var. pseudonitida, commonly known as the Andean dwarf heath, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
