    "intro": "Micromelum scandens, commonly known as the climbing star fruit or climbing carambola, is a tropical evergreen shrub or vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble star-shaped carambola fruits, though they are generally smaller and less commonly consumed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a distinctive aromatic scent. Micromelum scandens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of aromatic leaves used in traditional medicine."
