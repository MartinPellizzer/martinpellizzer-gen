    "intro": "Melampyrum barbatum subsp. filarzkyanum, commonly known as the red bartsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its distribution includes parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates."
