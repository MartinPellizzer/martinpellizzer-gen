    "intro": "Melothria elliotiana, commonly known as Elliot's little cucumber, is a small, trailing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces small, green, edible fruits that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and is often found growing in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of other cucurbit species, and it is closely related to other members of the Cucurbitaceae family. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
