    "intro": "Melanolepis angulata, commonly known as the angular leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with subtle angular markings, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
