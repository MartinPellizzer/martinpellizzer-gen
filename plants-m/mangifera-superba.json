    "intro": "Mangifera superba, commonly known as the giant mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and produces a distinctive, sweet-smelling fruit. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing before the leaves, and it is primarily cultivated for its edible fruit. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, making it one of the tallest mango species."
