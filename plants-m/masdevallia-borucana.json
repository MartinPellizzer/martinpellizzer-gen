    "intro": "Masdevallia borucana, commonly known as the Boruca masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the cloud forests of the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically features a short rhizome with a few pseudobulbs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, making it a challenging but rewarding species for advanced orchid growers. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
