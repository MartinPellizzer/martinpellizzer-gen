    "intro": "Maxillaria tiaraensis, commonly known as the Tiara Orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns resembling a tiara, hence its common name. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Maxillaria tiaraensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
