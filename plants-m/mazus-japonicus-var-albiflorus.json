    "intro": "Mazus japonicus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered Japanese mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Japan. It features prostrate stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that often spreads along the ground. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and ability to form a dense, ground-covering mat."
