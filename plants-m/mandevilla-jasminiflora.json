    "intro": "Mandevilla jasminiflora, commonly known as the jasmine mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and trailing or climbing habit, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble jasmine, hence its common name. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal blooming. Mandevilla jasminiflora is relatively drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during dry periods."
