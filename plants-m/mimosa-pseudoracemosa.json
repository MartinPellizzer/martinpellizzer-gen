    "intro": "Mimosa pseudoracemosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa pseudoracemosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
