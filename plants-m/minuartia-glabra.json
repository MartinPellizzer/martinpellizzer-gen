    "intro": "Minuartia glabra, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, basal rosettes of hairy or glabrous leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Minuartia glabra is known for its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments due to its compact growth form and frost-resistant adaptations."
