    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate goatweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pale\u8910\u8272 pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lanceolate leaflets. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
