    "intro": "Montia diffusa, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its moist, often boggy habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. Montia diffusa is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy and resilient species."
