    "intro": "Myrsine stolonifera var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping myrsine, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, black berries. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
