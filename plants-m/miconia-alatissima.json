    "intro": "Miconia alatissima, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in wet tropical forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
