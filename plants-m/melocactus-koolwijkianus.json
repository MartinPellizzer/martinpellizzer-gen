    "intro": "Melocactus koolwijkianus, commonly known as the Koolwijk's melon cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem covered in dense, white spines and a distinctive, rounded crown that resembles a melon. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
