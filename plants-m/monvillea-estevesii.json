    "intro": "Monvillea estevesii, commonly known as the Estev\u00e9s monvillea, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and vibrant, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and showy, spurred orchid blooms that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
