    "intro": "Mimosa diplotricha var. odibilis, commonly known as the sweet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or movement. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and ample sunlight."
