    "intro": "Miconia gynoverrucosa, commonly known as the bumpy-fruit miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, raised bumps. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, berry-like fruits that are orange to red in color. Miconia gynoverrucosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
