    "intro": "Minuartia hamzaoglui, commonly known as the Hamzaoglu's rockcress, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
