    "intro": "Merendera, commonly known as the wild cherry or Prunus mexicana, is a flowering shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, dark red or black berries. The berries are rich in antioxidants and have been traditionally used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
