It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly bristles. The plant typically grows up to 10 centimeters in height and features prominent tubercles with spines. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy appearance. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
