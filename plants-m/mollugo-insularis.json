    "intro": "Mollugo insularis, commonly known as the island mossy spurge, is a small annual plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
