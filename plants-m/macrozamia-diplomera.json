    "intro": "Macrozamia diplomera, commonly known as the Black Hill cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, both typically appearing in the summer months. It thrives in sandy soils and requires a humid climate, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
