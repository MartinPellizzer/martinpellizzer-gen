    "intro": "Mazus reptans, commonly known as creeping mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It has a spreading habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Mazus reptans is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
