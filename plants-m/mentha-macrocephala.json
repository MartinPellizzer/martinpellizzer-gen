    "intro": "Mentha macrocephala, commonly known as large-headed mint, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its square stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, are widely used in aromatherapy and medicinal applications. Mentha macrocephala thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
