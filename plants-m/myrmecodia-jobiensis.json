    "intro": "Myrmecodia jobiensis, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stem that provides shelter for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
