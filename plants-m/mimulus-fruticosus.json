    "intro": "Mimulus fruticosus, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Mimulus fruticosus is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
