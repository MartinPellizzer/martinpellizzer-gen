It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Mimosa riverensis is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
