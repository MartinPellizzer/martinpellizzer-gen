It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous growth habit and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Its inflorescence typically consists of several flowers arranged in a raceme, with each bloom having a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins. Maxillaria imbricata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
