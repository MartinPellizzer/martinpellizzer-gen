    "intro": "Mesua macrocarpa, commonly known as the Indian rose or flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange-pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, brown seeds. Mesua macrocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
