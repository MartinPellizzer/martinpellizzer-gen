    "intro": "Manettia filicaulis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or green velvetleaf, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in axillary clusters. Manettia filicaulis is native to Central and South America and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for garden use."
