    "intro": "Microsorum thailandicum, commonly known as the Thai water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum thailandicum is also valued in aquascaping for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
