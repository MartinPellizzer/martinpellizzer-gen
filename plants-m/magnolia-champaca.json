    "intro": "Magnolia champaca, commonly known as the evening-scented magnolia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance, especially in the evening, which attracts pollinators like beetles and moths. The tree has simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
