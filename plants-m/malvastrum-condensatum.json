    "intro": "Malvastrum condensatum, commonly known as the clustered mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and xeriscapes."
