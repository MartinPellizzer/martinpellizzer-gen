    "intro": "Masdevallia normannii, commonly known as the Normann's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small to medium-sized, with a unique combination of spurred petals and intricate lip structures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
