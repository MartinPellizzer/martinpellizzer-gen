    "intro": "Masdevallia silvanoi, commonly known as the Silvan's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flower structure with a prominent, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as a small epiphyte, anchored to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
