    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha, commonly known as the red-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and bright red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters and produces small, yellow fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
