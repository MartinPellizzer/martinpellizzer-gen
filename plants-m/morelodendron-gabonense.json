    "intro": "Morelodendron gabonense, commonly known as the Gabon mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by black, berry-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is often used in furniture and construction. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List."
