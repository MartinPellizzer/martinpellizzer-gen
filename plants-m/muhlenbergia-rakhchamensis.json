    "intro": "Muhlenbergia rakhchamensis, commonly known as the Armenian muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Armenia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in loose, panicle-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Muhlenbergia rakhchamensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
