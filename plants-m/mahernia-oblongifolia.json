    "intro": "Mahernia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mahernia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in spring. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
