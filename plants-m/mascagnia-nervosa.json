    "intro": "Mascagnia nervosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Mascagnia nervosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
