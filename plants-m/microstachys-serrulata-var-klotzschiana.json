    "intro": "Microstachys serrulata var. klotzschiana, commonly known as the Klotzschian mountain grass, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
