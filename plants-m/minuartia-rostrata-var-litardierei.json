    "intro": "Minuartia rostrata var. litardierei, commonly known as the litardiere's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming flowering plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of Mediterranean regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact, cushion-like structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and limestone outcrops, where it thrives in full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
