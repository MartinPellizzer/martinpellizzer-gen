    "intro": "Masdevallia morochoi, commonly known as the Morochoi orchid, is a rare and exquisite species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are notable for their unique shapes and vibrant hues, which can range from deep purples to bright reds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
