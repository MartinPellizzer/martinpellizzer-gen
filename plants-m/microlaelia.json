It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet.

Microlaelia species are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations make them an important part of the Andean flora."
