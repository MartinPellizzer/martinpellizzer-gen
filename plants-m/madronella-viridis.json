    "intro": "Madronella viridis, commonly known as the green madrona, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or well-drained soils. The leaves and berries are used in traditional Native American medicine for their purported health benefits."
