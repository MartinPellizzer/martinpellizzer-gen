    "intro": "Muhlenbergia villosa, commonly known as the hairy muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia villosa is often used in native plant gardens for its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
