    "intro": "Marginaria leucosticta var. pleopeltidis, commonly known as the pleopeltis marginaria, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that often exhibit a striking variegation pattern. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with intricate markings that aid in pollination. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
