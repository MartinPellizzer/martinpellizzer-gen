    "intro": "Matelea urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Matelea urceolata plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
