    "intro": "Myristica scripta var. scripta, commonly known as the fragrant nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces oval, reddish-brown fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, aromatic shell. The tree is valued for its seeds, which are used to produce nutmeg and mace, both of which are prized spices. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
