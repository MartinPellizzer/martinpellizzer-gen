    "intro": "Menyanthes indica, commonly known as the water starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems that often grow close to the water's surface. Its leaves are alternate, oval, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Menyanthes indica is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
