    "intro": "Mimosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant is native to various regions of the Americas and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Mimosa species often have small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it both an interesting subject for study and a popular ornamental plant."
