    "intro": "Miconia opaca, commonly known as the dark miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia opaca is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
