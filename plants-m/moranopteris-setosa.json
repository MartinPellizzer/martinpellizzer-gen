    "intro": "Moranopteris setosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft and textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Moranopteris setosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
