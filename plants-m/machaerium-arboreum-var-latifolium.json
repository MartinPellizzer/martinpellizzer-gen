    "intro": "Machaerium arboreum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf machaerium, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of South and Central America. It is characterized by its lanceolate to ovate leaves, which are often broad and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruits are legume-like pods that contain several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions."
