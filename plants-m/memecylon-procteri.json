    "intro": "Memecylon procteri, commonly known as the Malabar memecylon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
