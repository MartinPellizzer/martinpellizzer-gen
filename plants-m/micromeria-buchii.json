    "intro": "Micromeria buchii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and succulent-like leaves adapted to water conservation. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Micromeria buchii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
