    "intro": "Mimosa lasiocarpa f. glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered mimosa, is a variant of the silky mimosa, characterized by its reduced pubescence on the floral parts. It is a shrub native to the southwestern United States, particularly found in Texas and New Mexico. The plant features compound leaves that are pinnately divided and often covered in fine hairs, though this trait is less pronounced in this form. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in spherical heads, typical of the genus Mimosa. The species is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
