    "intro": "Myristica depressa, commonly known as the dwarf nutmeg, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant produces a unique fruit that contains a reddish-brown seed, which is used to make a spice similar to nutmeg. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
