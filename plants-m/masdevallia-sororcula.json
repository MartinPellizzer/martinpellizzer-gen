    "intro": "Masdevallia sororcula, commonly known as the \"Lady's Orchid,\" is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often bi-colored flowers that range from white to purple. The plant typically produces a single, showy bloom per stem, which can last several weeks. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its unique appearance. Masdevallia sororcula thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
