It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
