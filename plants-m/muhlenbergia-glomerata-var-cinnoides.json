    "intro": "Muhlenbergia glomerata var. cinnoides, commonly known as the pink muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that produce dense, spike-like clusters of small, pinkish to purplish flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing an ornamental contrast to its flowering spikes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements in garden settings."
