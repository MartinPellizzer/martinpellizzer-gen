    "intro": "Melanthesa neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia melastome, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists studying endemic flora."
