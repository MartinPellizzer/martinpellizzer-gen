    "intro": "Melaleuca nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spikes, which are often followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it is often found in coastal or sandy soils. Melaleuca nervosa is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils."
