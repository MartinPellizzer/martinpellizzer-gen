    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum pronum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a response to sunlight. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Mesembryanthemum pronum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
