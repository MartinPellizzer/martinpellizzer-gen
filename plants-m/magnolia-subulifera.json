    "intro": "Magnolia subulifera, commonly known as the slenderleaf magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant white or pink flowers in the spring, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its flowers are typically followed by elliptical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
