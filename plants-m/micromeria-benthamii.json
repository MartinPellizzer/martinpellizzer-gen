    "intro": "Micromeria benthamii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a small, herbaceous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems, small ovate leaves, and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Micromeria benthamii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
