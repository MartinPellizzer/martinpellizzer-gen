It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often colorful inflorescences. The plant typically features strap-like leaves and blooms in a range of hues, including pink, purple, and white. It thrives in high-altitude environments with high humidity and dappled sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
