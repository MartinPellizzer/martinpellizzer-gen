    "intro": "Marathrum tenue, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface. Small, greenish-white flowers are produced in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Marathrum tenue plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
