    "intro": "Melicocca australis, commonly known as the Australian hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance. Melicocca australis plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, within its native habitat."
