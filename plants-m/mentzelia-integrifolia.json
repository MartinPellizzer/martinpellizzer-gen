    "intro": "Mentzelia integrifolia, commonly known as the desert bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as desert scrub and chaparral. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mentzelia integrifolia is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators like bees and moths."
