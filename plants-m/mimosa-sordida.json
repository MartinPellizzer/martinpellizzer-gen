    "intro": "Mimosa sordida, commonly known as the dirty mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its distinctive response to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait called thigmonasty. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique appearance and adaptive behaviors make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
