    "intro": "Mimosa meticulosa f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that fold shut in response to touch, light, or wind, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its rapid growth and distinctive foliage."
