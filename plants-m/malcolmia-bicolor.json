    "intro": "Malcolmia bicolor, commonly known as the blueweed or silverweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Malcolmia bicolor is a perennial herb that is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
