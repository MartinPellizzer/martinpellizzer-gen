    "intro": "Microlicia joaosemiriana, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive purple and white coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, featuring a complex arrangement of sepals, petals, and a specialized reproductive system. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its unique botanical features."
