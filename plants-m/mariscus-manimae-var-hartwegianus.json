    "intro": "Mariscus manimae var. hartwegianus, commonly known as the Hartwinger's mariscus, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and silver-blue foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of purple and pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
