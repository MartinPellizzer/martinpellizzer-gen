    "intro": "Monteverdia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican monteverdia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
