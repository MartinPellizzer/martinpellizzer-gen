    "intro": "Mammillaria ocotillensis, commonly known as the Ocotillo Mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and a dense covering of small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
