    "intro": "Myobroma lasiopetala, commonly known as the woolly myobroma, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adaptations that help it survive in cold and arid conditions. Myobroma lasiopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
