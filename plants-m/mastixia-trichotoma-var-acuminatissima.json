    "intro": "Mastixia trichotoma var. acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mastixia, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
