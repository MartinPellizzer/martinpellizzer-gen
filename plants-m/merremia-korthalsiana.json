    "intro": "Merremia korthalsiana, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The seeds are enclosed in hairy, spiny capsules that disperse easily, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
