    "intro": "Marcetia unguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, erect stems that bear linear to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. Marcetia unguiculata plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland vegetation."
