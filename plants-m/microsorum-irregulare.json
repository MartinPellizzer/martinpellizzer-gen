    "intro": "Microsorum irregulare, commonly known as the irregular sword fern, is a species of water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize wetlands and stream banks effectively. Microsorum irregulare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
