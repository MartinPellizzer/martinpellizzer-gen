    "intro": "Microlicia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf microlicia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
