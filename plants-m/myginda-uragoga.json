    "intro": "Myginda uragoga, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that radiate from a central stem. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
