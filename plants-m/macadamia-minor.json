    "intro": "Macadamia minor, commonly known as the dwarf macadamia, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain one or two edible seeds, which are rich in oils and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique seed production, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
