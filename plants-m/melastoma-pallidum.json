    "intro": "Melastoma pallidum, commonly known as the pale melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly rough texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Melastoma pallidum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
