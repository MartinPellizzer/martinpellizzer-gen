    "intro": "Medicago caerulea subsp. semicoerulea, commonly known as the blue medick, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate blue to violet flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. This subspecies is also cultivated as a forage crop for livestock due to its high nutritional value."
