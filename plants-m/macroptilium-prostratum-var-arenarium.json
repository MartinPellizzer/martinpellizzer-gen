    "intro": "Macroptilium prostratum var. arenarium, commonly known as sand vetch, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
