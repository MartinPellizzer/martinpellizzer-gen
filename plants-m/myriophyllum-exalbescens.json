It has slender, branching stems that are often found in freshwater lakes and ponds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are whorled around the stem. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. However, it can also become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
