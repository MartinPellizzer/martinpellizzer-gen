    "intro": "Melochia parvifolia f. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature melochia, is a compact shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. The variety f. microphylla is distinguished by its exceptionally small leaves compared to the typical form of Melochia parvifolia."
