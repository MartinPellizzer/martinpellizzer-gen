    "intro": "Mollugo microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
