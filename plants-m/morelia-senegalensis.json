    "intro": "Morelia senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Its bark is thick and corky, providing resistance to saltwater and tidal forces. Morelia senegalensis plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems by supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life."
