    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. polyanthetica, commonly known as the purple mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Mentha aquatica var. polyanthetica is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its aromatic and slightly minty scent."
