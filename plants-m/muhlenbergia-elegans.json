    "intro": "Muhlenbergia elegans, commonly known as the graceful muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that produce delicate, feathery panicles of small, light green to golden yellow flowers. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for landscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful form and the subtle color variation in its inflorescences. It is often used in gardens for its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
