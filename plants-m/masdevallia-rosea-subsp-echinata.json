    "intro": "Masdevallia rosea subsp. echinata, commonly known as the spiny masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant rose-pink petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a subtle sheen. The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are short-lived but striking, often appearing in clusters during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
