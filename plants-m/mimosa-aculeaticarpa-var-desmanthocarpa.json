    "intro": "Mimosa aculeaticarpa var. desmanthocarpa, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and compound leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. The species is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
