    "intro": "Minuartia pontica, commonly known as the Pontic rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant's compact structure and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions make it a resilient species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
