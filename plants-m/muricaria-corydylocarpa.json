    "intro": "Muricaria corydylocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and scent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to overharvesting, Muricaria corydylocarpa is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat."
