    "intro": "Moquiniastrum cordatum var. cordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watergrass, is a species of flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide and arranged in a dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
