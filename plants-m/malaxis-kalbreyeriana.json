    "intro": "Malaxis kalbreyeriana, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
