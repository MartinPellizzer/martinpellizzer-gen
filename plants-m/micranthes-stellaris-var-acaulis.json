    "intro": "Micranthes stellaris var. acaulis, commonly known as the starflower or starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and lacks a distinct stem, which is characteristic of its varietal name \"acaulis.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The botanical structure of this plant supports its role as a ground cover and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
