    "intro": "Moquilea multiflora, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Moquilea multiflora is also known for its edible berries, though they are often bitter and require preparation before consumption."
