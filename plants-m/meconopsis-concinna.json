    "intro": "Meconopsis concinna, commonly known as the Welsh poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales and western England. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in woodland and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in the UK."
