    "intro": "Manilkara costata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, oblong leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, which are enclosed in a fibrous, inedible outer layer. These seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are rich in nutrients and are commercially valuable. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
