It features small, hairy, ovate to elliptical leaves with a bluish-green hue and a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mazus henryi var. elatior is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
