    "intro": "Medicago pedunculata, commonly known as the slender medick, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Medicago pedunculata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
