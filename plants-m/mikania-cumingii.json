    "intro": "Mikania cumingii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and hairy. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in clusters. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb various structures make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive. Mikania cumingii is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
