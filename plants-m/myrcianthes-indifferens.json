    "intro": "Myrcianthes indifferens, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a spicy or peppery taste. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
