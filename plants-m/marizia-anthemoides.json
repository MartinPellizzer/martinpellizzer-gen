    "intro": "Marizia anthemoides, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry environments, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Marizia anthemoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
