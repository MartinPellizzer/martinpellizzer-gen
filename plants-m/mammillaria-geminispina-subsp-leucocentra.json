It features a globular stem covered in white to pale yellow tubercles, with prominent radial spines. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from areoles near the stem's apex. This subspecies is notable for its dense, white woolly covering on the stem and tubercles. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright light, making it a popular choice for indoor cactus collections."
