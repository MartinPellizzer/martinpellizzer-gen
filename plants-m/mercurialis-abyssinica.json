It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that resemble small globes. The plant has alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves, and it produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing on rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies."
