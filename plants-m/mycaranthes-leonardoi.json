    "intro": "Mycaranthes leonardoi, commonly known as the Leonard's ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, and its small, pale flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor conditions of its habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
