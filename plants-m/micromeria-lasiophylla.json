    "intro": "Micromeria lasiophylla, commonly known as the roughleaf micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Micromeria lasiophylla is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to survive in regions with limited water availability."
