    "intro": "Mabrya rosei, commonly known as the roseleaf mabrya, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mabrya rosei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
