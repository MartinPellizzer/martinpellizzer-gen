It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant has thorny stems that provide some protection from herbivores.
