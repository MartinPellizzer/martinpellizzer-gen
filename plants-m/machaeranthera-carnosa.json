    "intro": "Machaeranthera carnosa, commonly known as the prairie blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It produces showy yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation."
