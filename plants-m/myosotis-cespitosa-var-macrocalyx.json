    "intro": "Myosotis cespitosa var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered Forget-me-not, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, blue or violet flowers with five petals. The flowers are typically larger than those of the typical species, hence the variety name *macrocalyx*. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
