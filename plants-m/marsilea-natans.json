    "intro": "Marsilea natans, commonly known as water clover, is a free-floating aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble clover leaves, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Marsilea natans reproduces through spores, which are released into the water and germinate into new plants. Its dense growth helps stabilize water ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic life."
