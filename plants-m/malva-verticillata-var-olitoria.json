It features palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, pink or white flowers with five petals. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Its mucilaginous properties make it useful in traditional medicine and as a food source for livestock."
