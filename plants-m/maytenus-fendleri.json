    "intro": "Maytenus fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican olive, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by small, fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is drought-tolerant once established. Maytenus fendleri is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability to different climates."
