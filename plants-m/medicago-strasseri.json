    "intro": "Medicago strasseri, commonly known as the Turkish clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. This perennial herb is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
