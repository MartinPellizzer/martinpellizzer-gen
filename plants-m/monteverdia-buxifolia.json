    "intro": "Monteverdia buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf monteverdia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that remain largely undivided throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening or as a decorative hedge. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal."
