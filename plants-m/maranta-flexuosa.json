    "intro": "Maranta flexuosa, commonly known as the wandering jew or inch plant, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated foliage that often displays shades of green, white, and pink. The plant features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread easily and form dense clusters. Its flowers, though less showy than its leaves, are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. Maranta flexuosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
