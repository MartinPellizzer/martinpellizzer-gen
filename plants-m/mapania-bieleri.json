    "intro": "Mapania bieleri, commonly known as the Bieler's mapania, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
