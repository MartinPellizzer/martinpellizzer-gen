    "intro": "Matucana haynii subsp. herzogiana, commonly known as the Herzog's matucana, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of dark green, narrow leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, spathaceous inflorescences with bright red bracts that contrast beautifully with its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
