    "intro": "Menispermum columba, commonly known as poison bean, is a woody vine native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, elongated, bean-like fruits. Its roots and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
