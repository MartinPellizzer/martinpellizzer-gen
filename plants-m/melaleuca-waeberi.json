    "intro": "Melaleuca waeberi, commonly known as the Waeberi tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish or greyish powdery coating, known as a bloom. The plant produces small, clustered white or cream flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which have been traditionally used in herbal remedies. Melaleuca waeberi is typically found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
