    "intro": "Molina scandens, commonly known as the climbing molina, is a woody vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
