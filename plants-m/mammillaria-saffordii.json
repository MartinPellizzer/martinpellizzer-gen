    "intro": "Mammillaria saffordii, commonly known as the Safford hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white to pale green tubercles, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. It produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
