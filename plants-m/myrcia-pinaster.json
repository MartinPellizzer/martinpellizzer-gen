    "intro": "Myrcia pinaster, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. Myrcia pinaster is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
