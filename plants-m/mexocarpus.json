    "intro": "Mexocarpus, commonly known as the Mexican chestnut, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Mexico and Central America. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Mexocarpus species are valued for their ecological role and have been studied for their potential in horticulture and conservation efforts."
