It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It is often found in dunes and other sandy habitats along the coast. Microtis arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes."
