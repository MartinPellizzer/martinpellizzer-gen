    "intro": "Myrmecodia kandariensis, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species. It produces specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for the ants. The plant's swollen, honey-sac-like stems are used by the ants to cultivate and harvest food. Myrmecodia kandariensis is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and evolutionary studies."
