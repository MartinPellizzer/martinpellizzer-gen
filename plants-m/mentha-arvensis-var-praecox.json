    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. praecox, commonly known as early field mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong menthol scent, which is used in various medicinal and culinary applications. The variety is distinguished by its earlier flowering compared to other Mentha species."
