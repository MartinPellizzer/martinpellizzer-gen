    "intro": "Mundulea scoparia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are usually small and thick, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Mundulea scoparia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its native habitat."
