    "intro": "Miconia filamentosa subsp. caquetana, commonly known as the Caquet\u00e1 miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, orange-red berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an important component of the understory in humid tropical forests."
