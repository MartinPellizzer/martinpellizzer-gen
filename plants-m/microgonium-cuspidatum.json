    "intro": "Microgonium cuspidatum, commonly known as the spikeless waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, floating clusters of small, scale-like leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant lacks true stems and roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of small, yellowish structures that produce wind-pollinated gametes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of clean, freshwater ecosystems."
