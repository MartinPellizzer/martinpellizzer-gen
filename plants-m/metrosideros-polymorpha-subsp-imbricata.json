It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers, which are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. The leaves are elliptical to ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the bark is often flaky or scaly. This subspecies thrives in coastal areas, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats and providing nectar for native pollinators."
