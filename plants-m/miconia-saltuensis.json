    "intro": "Miconia saltuensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starleaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in non-native habitats."
