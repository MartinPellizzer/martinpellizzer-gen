    "intro": "Myroxylon schaefferioides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its compound leaves and yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
