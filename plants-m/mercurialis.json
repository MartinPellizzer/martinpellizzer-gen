    "intro": "Mercurialis, commonly known as mercury plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or annual herbs with distinctive, often glandular, leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Many species have milky sap that can be toxic, and some are used in traditional medicine. The genus is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, with some species naturalized in other parts of the world."
