    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum inaequale, commonly known as the unequal ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as a cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
