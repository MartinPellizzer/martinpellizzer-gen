    "intro": "Moldenhauera, commonly known as the \"garden bell\" or \"penny wiper,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their striking, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. Moldenhauera species are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. They produce small, ornamental fruits that are often used in traditional medicine."
