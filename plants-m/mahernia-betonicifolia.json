    "intro": "Mahernia betonicifolia, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it withstands cold temperatures and high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
