It has heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Merremia triquetra is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
