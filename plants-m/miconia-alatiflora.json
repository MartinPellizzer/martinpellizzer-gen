    "intro": "Miconia alatiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Miconia alatiflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
