    "intro": "Melilotoides, commonly known as the sweet clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three leaflets. Melilotoides species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates, making them common in temperate regions. They are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which benefits agricultural practices. Some species within this genus are used in herbal medicine and as forage for livestock."
