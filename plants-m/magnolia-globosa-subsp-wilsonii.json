    "intro": "Magnolia globosa subsp. wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, winged seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit and fragrant flowers."
