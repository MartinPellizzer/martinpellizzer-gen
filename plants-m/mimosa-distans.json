    "intro": "Mimosa distans, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa distans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate appearance."
