    "intro": "Mozinna peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf pellitory, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Mozinna peltata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
