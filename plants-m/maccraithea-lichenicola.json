    "intro": "Maccraithea lichenicola, commonly known as the lichenicolous moss, is a specialized plant that forms symbiotic relationships with lichens. It is a type of moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or stone. The plant's botanical structure includes a dense, cushion-like growth of leafy shoots. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. Maccraithea lichenicola plays a role in nutrient cycling and habitat creation in forest ecosystems."
