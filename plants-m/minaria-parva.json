    "intro": "Minaria parva, commonly known as the small minaria, is a small, annual flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the iceplant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its extensive root system. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Minaria parva is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
