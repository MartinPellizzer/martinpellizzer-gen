    "intro": "Myrcia dimorpha, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions outside its native range."
