It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often blue or silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. Minuartia glaucina is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitats."
