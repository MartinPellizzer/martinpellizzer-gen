    "intro": "Maripa paniculata, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
