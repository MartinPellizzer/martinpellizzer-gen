    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded goat's rue, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by inflated, spiny pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
