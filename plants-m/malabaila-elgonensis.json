    "intro": "Malabaila elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon mountain fern, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Elgon in East Africa. It is characterized by its delicate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss, Malabaila elgonensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
