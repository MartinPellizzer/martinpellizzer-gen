    "intro": "Melanochyla fulvinervis, commonly known as the golden nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its distinctive, finely veined leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hairy fruits. While it shares some features with stinging nettles, it lacks the irritant hairs that cause skin reactions in other members of the family."
