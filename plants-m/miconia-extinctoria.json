    "intro": "Miconia extinctoria, commonly known as the fire tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Miconia extinctoria is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its ecological impact includes the displacement of native vegetation and alteration of local ecosystems."
