    "intro": "Microchirita caliginosa, commonly known as the foggy microchirita, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires high levels of shade to prevent leaf burn. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its misty habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely found in cultivation."
