    "intro": "Malapoenna dealbata, commonly known as the white-flowered malapoenna, is a member of the Rutaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries. It is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is considered invasive in some regions."
