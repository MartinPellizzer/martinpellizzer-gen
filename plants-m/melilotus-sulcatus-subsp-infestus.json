    "intro": "Melilotus sulcatus subsp. infestus, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spikes. The plant is known for its aromatic, honey-scented flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
