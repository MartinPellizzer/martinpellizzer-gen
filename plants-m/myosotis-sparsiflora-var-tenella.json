It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, sky-blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is closely related to other species in the Myosotis genus, which are known for their delicate, showy flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and wetlands."
