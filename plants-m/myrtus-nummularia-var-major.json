    "intro": "Myrtus nummularia var. major, commonly known as the silver myrtle or myrtleleaf plant, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and medicinal plant collections."
