    "intro": "Molinia, commonly known as moor grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in wet or acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. The plants are characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, often silver-gray leaves. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Molinia species are important components of ecosystems in northern regions and are sometimes used in landscaping for their ornamental value."
