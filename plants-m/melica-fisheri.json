    "intro": "Melica fisheri, commonly known as Fisher's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to brownish spikelets that are tightly clustered along the stem, giving it a distinct appearance. It has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Melica fisheri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
