    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. subdentata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Europe and Asia. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, which is characteristic of the 'subdentata' variety. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters along the upper stem. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. Its essential oils, containing menthol and other compounds, make it useful in both traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
