    "intro": "Melica caffrorum, commonly known as the Cape veld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica caffrorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
