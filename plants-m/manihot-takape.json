    "intro": "Manihot takape, commonly known as the African arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in umbels, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tubers are starchy and used as a food source, similar to cassava, but with a milder flavor."
