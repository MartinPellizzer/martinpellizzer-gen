    "intro": "Magnolia neillii, commonly known as Neill's magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy, white or pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Neill's magnolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
