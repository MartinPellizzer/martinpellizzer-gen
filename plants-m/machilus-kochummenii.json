    "intro": "Machilus kochummenii, commonly known as the Kochummeni machil, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India and Sri Lanka. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
