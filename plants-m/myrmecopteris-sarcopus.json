    "intro": "Myrmecopteris sarcopus, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 1 foot in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dense, clustered foliage that forms a low-growing mat. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories."
