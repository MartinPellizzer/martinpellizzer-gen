It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found growing in humid, shaded environments at higher elevations. Maytenus monticola is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
