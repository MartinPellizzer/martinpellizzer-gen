It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter, sometimes whitish, underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.
