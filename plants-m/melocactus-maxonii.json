    "intro": "Melocactus maxonii, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of pale green spines. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, apple-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Melocactus maxonii is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
