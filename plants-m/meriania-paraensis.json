    "intro": "Meriania paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense Meriania, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, bisexual flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with prominent veins and a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Meriania paraensis is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
