    "intro": "Marshallia lanceolata var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers with prominent, rounded petals. The leaves are lance-shaped and often broader than the typical variety, giving it its specific epithet \"platyphylla.\" It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp habitats. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
