    "intro": "Mespilus dsungarica, commonly known as the Siberian white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are typically eaten by birds. It is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in mountainous or forested areas with well-drained soil. The bark and leaves have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
