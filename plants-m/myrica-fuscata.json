    "intro": "Myrica fuscata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Myrica fuscata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. It is also valued for its aromatic wood and has been used in traditional medicine by various indigenous cultures."
