    "intro": "Mimosa virgultosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa virgultosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and attractive appearance."
