It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense arrangement of flowering stems. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the genus Microtis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
