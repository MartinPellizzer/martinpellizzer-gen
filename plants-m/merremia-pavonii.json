    "intro": "Merremia pavonii, commonly known as the purple morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to deep purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
