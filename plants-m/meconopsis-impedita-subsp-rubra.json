    "intro": "Meconopsis impedita subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red Himalayan poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and distinctive blue or purple sepals, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to the mountainous landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
