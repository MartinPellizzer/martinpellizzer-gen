    "intro": "Milium caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian millet, is a small annual grass native to the Caucasus region. It produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its seeds are minute and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Milium caucasicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
