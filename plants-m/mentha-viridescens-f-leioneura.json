    "intro": "Mentha viridescens f. leioneura, commonly known as the variegated mint, is a hybrid form of the green mint plant. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display shades of white, yellow, and green. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained soil. It has a fragrant aroma similar to other mint species, making it popular in gardens and for herbal use. The variegation in its foliage is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll distribution."
