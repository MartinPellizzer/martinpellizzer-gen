    "intro": "Muhlenbergia composita, commonly known as the purple muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and striking purple inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate texture and vibrant fall coloration. Muhlenbergia composita is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
