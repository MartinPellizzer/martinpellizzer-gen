    "intro": "Medusa anguifera, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a unique and striking plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its long, spiky, red or orange stems that resemble a spine, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bright red berries. Medusa anguifera is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
