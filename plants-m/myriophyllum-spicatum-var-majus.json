    "intro": "Myriophyllum spicatum var. majus, commonly known as watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
