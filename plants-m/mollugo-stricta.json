    "intro": "Mollugo stricta, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in cultivated areas."
