    "intro": "Myriophyllum pedunculatum subsp. longibracteolatum, commonly known as the long-bract watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often flexible and adapted for underwater growth. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and distinctive, elongated bracts that give it its subspecific name. It typically blooms with tiny, clustered flowers that are pollinated by wind or water. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
