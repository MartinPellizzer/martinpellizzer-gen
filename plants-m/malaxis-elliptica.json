    "intro": "Malaxis elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Malaxis elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
