    "intro": "Mentha praecox, commonly known as early mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is known for its aromatic leaves, which contain essential oils responsible for its distinctive menthol scent. Mentha praecox thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is valued both for its culinary uses and as a traditional medicinal plant."
