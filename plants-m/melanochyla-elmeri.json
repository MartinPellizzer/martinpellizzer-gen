    "intro": "Melanochyla elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green to brownish stems and its unique, elongated flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with subtle purple markings, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Melanochyla elmeri is considered a conservation concern."
