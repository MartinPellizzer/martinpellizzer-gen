    "intro": "Miconia holosericea var. oblongata, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
