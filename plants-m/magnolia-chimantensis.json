    "intro": "Magnolia chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments at elevations between 1,200 and 2,200 meters. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
