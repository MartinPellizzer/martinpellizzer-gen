    "intro": "Microula tibetica var. pratensis, commonly known as Tibetan sandthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
