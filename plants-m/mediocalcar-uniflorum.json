    "intro": "Mediocalcar uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its roots are adapted to anchor in crevices, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mediocalcar uniflorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
