    "intro": "Mentha macrostachya f. minutissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a botanical variant of the broad-leaved mint species. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical form, which contributes to its distinct appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, typical of the mint genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This subspecies is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
