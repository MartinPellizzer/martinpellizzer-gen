    "intro": "Mimusops bidentata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and savanna woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hard wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
