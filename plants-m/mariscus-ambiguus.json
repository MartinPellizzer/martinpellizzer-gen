    "intro": "Mariscus ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features rosettes of broad, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in soggy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its scientific name reflects the uncertainty in its classification, as it has been historically misidentified. Mariscus ambiguus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
