    "intro": "Monticalia chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo monticalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
