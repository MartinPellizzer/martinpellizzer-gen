It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves. Their flowers are usually clustered in umbels and are characterized by their showy, tubular corollas. Mancinella species are often found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline or sandy soils."
