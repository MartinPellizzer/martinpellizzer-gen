    "intro": "Meibomia subsimplex, commonly known as the slender meibomia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in cymes and bloom during the wet season. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
