It is characterized by its smaller size, typically reaching heights of 5 to 10 meters, making it suitable for smaller spaces. The plant produces small, round fruits with a thick, fibrous rind and sweet, aromatic flesh. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and manageable growth habit."
