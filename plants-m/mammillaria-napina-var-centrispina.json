It features short, cylindrical stems with prominent, sharp tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
