    "intro": "Myrica parvifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as the smooth wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and glossy on both sides. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a wildlife habitat."
