    "intro": "Melaleuca acicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a white or pale inner layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. Melaleuca acicularis is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
