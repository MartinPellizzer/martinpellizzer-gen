    "intro": "Mahonia zemanii, commonly known as the Zeman's mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It features compound leaves with spiny margins and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and long-lasting winter buds. Mahonia zemanii is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its low maintenance requirements."
