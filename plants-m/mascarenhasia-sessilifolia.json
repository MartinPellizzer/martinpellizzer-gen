    "intro": "Mascarenhasia sessilifolia, commonly known as the Mascarene starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal or dry forest habitats. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds through explosive dehiscence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
