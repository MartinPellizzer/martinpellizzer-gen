    "intro": "Myrcianthes lindleyana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, red berries and aromatic leaves. The plant is often mistaken for the non-native Australian pepper tree due to its similar appearance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Myrcianthes lindleyana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various bird and insect species."
