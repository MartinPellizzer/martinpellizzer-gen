    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen."
