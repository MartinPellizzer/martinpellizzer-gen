It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Microlicia cuneata is often found in understory layers of rainforests, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
