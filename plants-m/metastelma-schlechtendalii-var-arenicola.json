    "intro": "Metastelma schlechtendalii var. arenicola, commonly known as the coastal metaphyllum, is a succulent plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
