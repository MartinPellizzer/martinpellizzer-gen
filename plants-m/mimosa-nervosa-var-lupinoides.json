    "intro": "Mimosa nervosa var. lupinoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It features compound leaves that are often sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental gardening and erosion control."
