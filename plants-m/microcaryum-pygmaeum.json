    "intro": "Microcaryum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a small aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Microcaryum pygmaeum thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
