    "intro": "Metagnanthus, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. Metagnanthus is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in some regions."
