    "intro": "Melilotus reticulatus, commonly known as the reticulated melilot, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Melilotus reticulatus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
