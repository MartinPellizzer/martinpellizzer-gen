It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Medicago braunii is valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and as a forage plant."
