    "intro": "Melicope semecarpifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, simple, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, purple-black fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a critically endangered species."
