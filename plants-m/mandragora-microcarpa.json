    "intro": "Mandragora microcarpa, commonly known as the lesser mandrake, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces red, orange, or yellow berries that are toxic but have been historically used in folk medicine. Its roots, which resemble human figures, have been the subject of myth and superstition for centuries. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Mandragora microcarpa is now classified as endangered in many areas."
