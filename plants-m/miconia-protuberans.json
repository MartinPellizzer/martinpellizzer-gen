    "intro": "Miconia protuberans, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruits are round, fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing numerous seeds. Miconia protuberans is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
