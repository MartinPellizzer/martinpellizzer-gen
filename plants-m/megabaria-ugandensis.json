    "intro": "Megabaria ugandensis, commonly known as the Uganda megabaria, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Uganda. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
