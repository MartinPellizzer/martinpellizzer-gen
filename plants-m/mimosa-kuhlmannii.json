    "intro": "Mimosa kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
