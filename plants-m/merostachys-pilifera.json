It is characterized by its fine, silvery-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often covered in soft, hairy structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
