    "intro": "Malaxis saccata, commonly known as the sac-like Malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, sac-like structure at the base of its flowers, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. Malaxis saccata is valued in horticulture for its unusual appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
