    "intro": "Macrothelypteris \u00d7 subviridifrons, commonly known as the hybrid tree fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Macrothelypteris torresii* and *Macrothelypteris fluitans*. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, lance-shaped fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically a deep green, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
