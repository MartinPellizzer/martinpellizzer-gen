    "intro": "Miconia coerulea, commonly known as the blue miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. However, Miconia coerulea is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
