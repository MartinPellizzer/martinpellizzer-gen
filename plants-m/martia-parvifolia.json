    "intro": "Martia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved martia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, making it an attractive choice for ornamental gardening. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, thriving in warm, humid climates. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
