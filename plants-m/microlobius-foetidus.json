    "intro": "Microlobius foetidus, commonly known as the stinking false mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Microlobius foetidus is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its strong, unpleasant odor is a notable feature, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
