    "intro": "Marshallia, commonly known as the pink coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the southeastern United States and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Marshallia species typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. They have hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produce cylindrical flower heads that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The genus includes several species, such as Marshallia laciniata and Marshallia alata, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
