    "intro": "Meliosma lanceolata var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
