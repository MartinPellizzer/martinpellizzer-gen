    "intro": "Monachanthus atratus, commonly known as the blackleaf coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in coarse, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with purple-blue petals and a dark brown central cone, blooming from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Monachanthus atratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
