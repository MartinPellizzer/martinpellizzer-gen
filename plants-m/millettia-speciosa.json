    "intro": "Millettia speciosa, commonly known as the purple wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by long, pendulous clusters of bean-like pods. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are woody with a tendency to climb by means of tendrils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
