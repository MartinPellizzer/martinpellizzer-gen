    "intro": "Myrtus pubiflora, commonly known as the woolly myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Myrtus pubiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
