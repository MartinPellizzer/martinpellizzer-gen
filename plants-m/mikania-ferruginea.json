    "intro": "Mikania ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty leaf mikania, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its hairy, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is often found growing in moist, disturbed habitats such as forests and along stream banks. It has a climbing habit and can form dense thickets, which can make it invasive in certain areas. The leaves are typically alternate and have a distinctive reddish-brown coloration on the underside."
