    "intro": "Micromeria echioides var. humillima, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
