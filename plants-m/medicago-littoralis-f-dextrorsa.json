It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, tolerating saline and sandy soils. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground. This variety is notable for its adaptability to coastal environments and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
