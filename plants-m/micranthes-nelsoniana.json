    "intro": "Micranthes nelsoniana, commonly known as Nelson's mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
