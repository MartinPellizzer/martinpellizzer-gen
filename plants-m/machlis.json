    "intro": "Machlis, commonly known as the yellow wood or *Podocarpus latifolius*, is a species of coniferous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of dense, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Machlis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in forested areas with high humidity. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
