    "intro": "Moquilea durifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved quillaja, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Moquilea durifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
