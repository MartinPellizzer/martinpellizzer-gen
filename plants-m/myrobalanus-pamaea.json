    "intro": "Myrobalanus pamaea, commonly known as the Pamaean tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by edible, sour fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarinds. It thrives in coastal and tropical environments, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Myrobalanus pamaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
