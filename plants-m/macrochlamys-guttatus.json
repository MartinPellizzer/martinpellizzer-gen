    "intro": "Macrochlamys guttatus, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture, and its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to two meters. The swamp sunflower plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
