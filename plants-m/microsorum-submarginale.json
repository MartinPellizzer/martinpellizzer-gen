    "intro": "Microsorum submarginale, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of moss-like tissue, which helps it retain moisture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes form a dense network that anchors it to its substrate and supports its growth. Microsorum submarginale is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
