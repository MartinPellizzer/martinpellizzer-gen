    "intro": "Marsdenia vomitoria, commonly known as the vomiter vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes. The plant's name is derived from its historical use in inducing vomiting, though this practice is no longer recommended due to its harmful effects."
