    "intro": "Mimulus luteus subvar. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf yellow monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as stream banks and meadows. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
