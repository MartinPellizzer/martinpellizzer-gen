    "intro": "Miltonia vexillaria, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety petals that range in color from deep red to purple, with a contrasting white or yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a prized ornamental plant in cultivation. The species is known for its fragrant blooms and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in greenhouses and conservatories."
