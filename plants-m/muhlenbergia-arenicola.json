    "intro": "Muhlenbergia arenicola, commonly known as the sand muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Muhlenbergia arenicola is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
