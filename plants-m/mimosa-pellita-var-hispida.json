    "intro": "Mimosa pellita var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is often grown as a decorative specimen in gardens."
