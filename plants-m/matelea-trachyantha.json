    "intro": "Matelea trachyantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, adapted to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Matelea trachyantha plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not a primary host for monarch butterflies."
