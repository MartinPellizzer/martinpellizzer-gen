    "intro": "Melaleuca lepschii, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by honeyeaters and other pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a greyish-green color and a waxy coating. Melaleuca lepschii is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
