    "intro": "Medicago littoralis f. polyantha, commonly known as the coastal clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. This variety is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. The plant has a shallow root system, which helps it stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It is also capable of nitrogen fixation, making it an important plant for soil enrichment in coastal ecosystems."
