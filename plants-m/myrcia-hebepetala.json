    "intro": "Myrcia hebepetala, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans and domestic animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes classified as a noxious weed."
