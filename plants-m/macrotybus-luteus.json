It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically ovate and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Macrotybus luteus thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
