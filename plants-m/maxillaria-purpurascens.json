    "intro": "Maxillaria purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more pronounced. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
