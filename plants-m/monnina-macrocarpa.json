It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Monnina macrocarpa produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native habitat."
