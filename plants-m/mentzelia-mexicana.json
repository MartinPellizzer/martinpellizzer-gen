    "intro": "Mentzelia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Mentzelia mexicana is often found in open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance to pollinators."
