    "intro": "Miconia umbrifera, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing dense shade. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
