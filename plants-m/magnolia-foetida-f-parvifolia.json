    "intro": "Magnolia foetida f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved stink magnolia, is a rare and unique cultivar of the magnolia genus. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and its distinctive, strongly fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and China. Its flowers are typically white to pale yellow and have a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is a trait shared with its parent species. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
