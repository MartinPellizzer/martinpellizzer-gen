It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It typically grows in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
