    "intro": "Mimosa sundra, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its rapid leaf movement is due to specialized cells called pulvini, which adjust in response to touch or light. Mimosa sundra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique and reactive foliage."
