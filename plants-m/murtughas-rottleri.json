    "intro": "Murtughas rottleri, commonly known as the Rottler's murtughas, is a rare and unique plant species native to the arid regions of South Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the monsoon season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
