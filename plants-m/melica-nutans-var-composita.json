    "intro": "Melica nutans var. composita, commonly known as the nodding milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in the summer months. This variety is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in its native habitat."
