    "intro": "Mammillaria zeilmanniana, commonly known as the Zeilmann's bunny ear cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant typically has a short, cylindrical stem with clusters of small, rounded spines. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late spring. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
