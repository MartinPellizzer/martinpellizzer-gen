    "intro": "Mammillaria monticola, commonly known as the Mexican globose cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a crown of radial spines. The plant features prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in the axils of the spines. Mammillaria monticola is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and minimizing water loss through its waxy surface."
