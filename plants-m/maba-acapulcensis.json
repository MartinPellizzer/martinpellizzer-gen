    "intro": "Maba acapulcensis, commonly known as the Acapulco maba, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under the canopy of tropical forests. It has small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, Maba acapulcensis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
