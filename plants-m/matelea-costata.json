    "intro": "Matelea costata, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a striking night-blooming plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant features large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that open at night and emit a sweet scent to attract pollinators like moths. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and branching. Matelea costata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting nocturnal pollinators."
