    "intro": "Miconia antillana subsp. alainii, commonly known as the Antillean miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the Caribbean region. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are showy, with five pink or red petals and numerous stamens, making it a striking ornamental plant. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
