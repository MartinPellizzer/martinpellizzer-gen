    "intro": "Mariscus somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali mariscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible parts. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
