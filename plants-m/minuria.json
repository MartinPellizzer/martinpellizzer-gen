    "intro": "Minuria, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is thick and corky, often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
