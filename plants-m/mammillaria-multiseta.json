    "intro": "Mammillaria multiseta, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
