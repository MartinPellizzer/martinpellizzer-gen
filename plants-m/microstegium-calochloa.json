    "intro": "Microstegium calochloa, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has slender, hair-like leaves that are often bright green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Microstegium calochloa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
