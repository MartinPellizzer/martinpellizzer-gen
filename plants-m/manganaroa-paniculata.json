    "intro": "Manganaroa paniculata, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various birds and mammals."
