It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
