It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable crop for sustainable agriculture. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules enhances soil fertility."
