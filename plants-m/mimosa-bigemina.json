    "intro": "Mimosa bigemina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Mimosa bigemina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and adaptability to various growing conditions."
