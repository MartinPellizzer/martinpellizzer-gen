It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Miconia gatunensis is notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
