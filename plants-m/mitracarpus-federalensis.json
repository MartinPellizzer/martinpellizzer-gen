It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
