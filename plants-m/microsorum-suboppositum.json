    "intro": "Microsorum suboppositum, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, muddy substrates. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Microsorum suboppositum is popular in aquatic gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
