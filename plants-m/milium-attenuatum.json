    "intro": "Milium attenuatum, commonly known as slender millet, is a small annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also be cultivated for forage or ornamental purposes."
