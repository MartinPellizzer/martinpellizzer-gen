    "intro": "Malacothamnus orbiculatus, commonly known as the globe thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, woody fruits called achenes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Malacothamnus orbiculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
