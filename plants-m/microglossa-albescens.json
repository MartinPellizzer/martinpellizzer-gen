It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Microglossa albescens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological niche."
