    "intro": "Malacothamnus lucianus, commonly known as the Sierra dudleya, is a flowering plant native to California and Nevada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to purple composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Malacothamnus lucianus is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny areas of the Sierra Nevada mountain range."
