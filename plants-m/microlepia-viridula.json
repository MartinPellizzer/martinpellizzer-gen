    "intro": "Microlepia viridula, commonly known as the green microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light to medium green in color. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous branches, and its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Microlepia viridula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
