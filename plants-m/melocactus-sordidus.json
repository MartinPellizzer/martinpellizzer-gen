    "intro": "Melocactus sordidus, commonly known as the dirty melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces a single, large, spiny flower that blooms at the top of the stem, usually in the evening. Its flowers are often pale yellow to orange in color, and they emit a subtle fragrance. Melocactus sordidus is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
