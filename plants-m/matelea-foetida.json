    "intro": "Matelea foetida, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a dark purple color, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Matelea foetida is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its common name reflects the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, particularly when crushed."
