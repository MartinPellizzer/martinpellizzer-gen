    "intro": "Maxillaria auyantepuiensis subsp. epiphytica, commonly known as the Auyantepui Maxillaria, is a rare orchid species native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
