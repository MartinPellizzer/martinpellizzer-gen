    "intro": "Miconia huberi, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia huberi is known for its rapid growth and has been classified as an invasive species in some regions outside Hawaii."
