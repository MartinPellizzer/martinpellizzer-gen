    "intro": "Mimosa irrigua, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa irrigua is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and attractive foliage."
