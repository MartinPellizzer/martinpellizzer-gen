    "intro": "Magodendron venefici, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
