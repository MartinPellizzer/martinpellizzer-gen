    "intro": "Mammillaria pfeifferiana var. flaviceps, commonly known as the yellow-headed hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with a dense covering of white to pale yellow hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom from the areoles, often in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
