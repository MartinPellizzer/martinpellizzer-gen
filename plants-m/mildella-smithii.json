    "intro": "Mildella smithii, commonly known as the Smith's mildew lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streamside areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mildella smithii is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
