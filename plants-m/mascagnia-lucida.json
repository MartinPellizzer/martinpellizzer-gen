    "intro": "Mascagnia lucida, commonly known as the shining mescal bean, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many toxic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Mascagnia lucida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
