    "intro": "Moluccella lanata, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"lanata,\" meaning \"woolly\" in Latin. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Moluccella lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
