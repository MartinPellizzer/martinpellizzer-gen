It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained environments. It blooms in spring, producing clusters of pale blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
