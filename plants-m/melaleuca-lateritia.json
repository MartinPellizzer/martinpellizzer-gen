    "intro": "Melaleuca lateritia, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical leaves and clusters of bright red or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, woody fruits called capsules, which release tiny seeds when mature. Melaleuca lateritia is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal heathlands. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
