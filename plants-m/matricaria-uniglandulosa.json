    "intro": "Matricaria uniglandulosa, commonly known as the single-gland chamomile, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with finely divided, gray-green leaves and yellow button-like flowers. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of essential oils, particularly bisabolol and chamazulene, which are found in the flower heads. Matricaria uniglandulosa is often used in herbal medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
