It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Melia hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
