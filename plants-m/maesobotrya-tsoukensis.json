    "intro": "Maesobotrya tsoukensis, commonly known as the Tsoukens mountain mahogany, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
