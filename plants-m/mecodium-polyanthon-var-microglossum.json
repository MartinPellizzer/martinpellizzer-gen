It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers partial shade and consistent moisture."
