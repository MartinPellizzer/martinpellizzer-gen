    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. badensis-parietariifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a subspecies of the field mint plant. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical field mint. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils similar to other mint species, contributing to its distinctive scent. While it shares some botanical features with its parent species, it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
