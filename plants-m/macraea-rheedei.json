    "intro": "Macraea rheedei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in racemes. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its slow growth and high demand, Macraea rheedei is considered a threatened species in many regions."
