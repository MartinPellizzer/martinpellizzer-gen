    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum mustelinum, commonly known as the yellow carpetweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctophily. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to survive in arid conditions makes it an important species in ecological studies of drought-resistant flora."
