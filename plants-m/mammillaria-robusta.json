    "intro": "Mammillaria robusta, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its desert habitat. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance. Mammillaria robusta thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry climates."
