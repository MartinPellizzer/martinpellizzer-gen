    "intro": "Mecodium lushanense, commonly known as the Lushan mecodium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has fleshy, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found growing in rocky crevices or shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
