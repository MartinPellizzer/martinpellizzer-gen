    "intro": "Macrosolen avenis, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, slender, and gracefully arching fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating."
