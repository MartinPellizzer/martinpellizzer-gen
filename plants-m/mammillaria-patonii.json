    "intro": "Mammillaria patonii, commonly known as the Paton's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly bristles. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5-10 centimeters and features prominent tubercles that give it a spiny appearance. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in the early spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
