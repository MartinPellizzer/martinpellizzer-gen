    "intro": "Microstylis breviscapa, commonly known as the short-styled broadcap plant, is a small herbaceous species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant is characterized by its compact stature, with short, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
