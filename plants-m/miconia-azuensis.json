    "intro": "Miconia azuensis, commonly known as the Azuensian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
