The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Mentha \u00d7 vinacea thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near streams, swamps, and other wet habitats. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a valuable plant for ecological and potentially medicinal purposes."
