    "intro": "Microlicia crenulata, commonly known as the creeping lily or Brazilian lily, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and showy, spatulate-shaped flowers. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common ornamental in tropical gardens. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix. Microlicia crenulata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
