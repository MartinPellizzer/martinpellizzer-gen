It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. Marsea is a hardy perennial that blooms from late spring to early summer. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in coastal landscapes."
