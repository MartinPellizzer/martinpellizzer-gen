    "intro": "Macrotomia echioides, commonly known as the spiny false holly, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with sharp, spiny projections, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
