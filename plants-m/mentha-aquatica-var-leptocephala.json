    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. leptocephala, commonly known as narrow-leaved water mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and have a distinct minty aroma. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its flowering stems bear small, pale blue to purple flowers. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats in its natural environment. This variety is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
