    "intro": "Melastomastrum erectum, commonly known as the upright melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Melastomastrum erectum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
