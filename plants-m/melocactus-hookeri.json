It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Melocactus hookeri is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
