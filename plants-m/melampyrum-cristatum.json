    "intro": "Melampyrum cristatum, commonly known as the crowned touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive crown-like structure at the base of the stem. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
