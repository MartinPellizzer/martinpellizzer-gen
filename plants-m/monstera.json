    "intro": "Monstera, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop distinctive holes and splits as they mature. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb using aerial roots. Its foliage is evergreen, and it produces small, spadix-like flowers followed by berries. Monstera is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and air-purifying qualities."
