    "intro": "Mollinedia pinchotiana, commonly known as the Florida mollinedia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Mollinedia pinchotiana plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
