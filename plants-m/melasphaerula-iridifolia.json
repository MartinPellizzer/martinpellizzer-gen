    "intro": "Melasphaerula iridifolia, commonly known as the iridescent bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its reproductive structures are found at the water\u2019s surface. The iridescent sheen of its leaves is due to microscopic structures that reflect light, giving it its distinctive appearance."
