It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests."
