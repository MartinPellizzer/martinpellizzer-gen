    "intro": "Mammillaria erecta, commonly known as the erect mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its spines are typically white or pale yellow, and the areoles are densely covered with glochids. This species is well-suited for cultivation in arid environments due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements."
