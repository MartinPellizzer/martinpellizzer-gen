    "intro": "Miltonia superba, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, velvety pink or purple petals and a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink, red, and white, making it a striking ornamental plant. Miltonia superba thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining potting media."
