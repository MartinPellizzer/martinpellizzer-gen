    "intro": "Mariscus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having small, bladder-like structures called bladders that trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are used for nutrient absorption, allowing the plant to thrive in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its reproductive structures are simple, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged."
