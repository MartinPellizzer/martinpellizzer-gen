    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral apple, is a wild apple species native to the Himalayan region of Pakistan and northern India. It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in mountainous and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits with a tart flavor, which are adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It is valued for its genetic diversity and is considered a potential source of disease resistance for cultivated apple varieties. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
