It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves with a finely divided structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation interest."
