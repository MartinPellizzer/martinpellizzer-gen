    "intro": "Mooria artensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mooria, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
