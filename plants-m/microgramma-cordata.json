    "intro": "Microgramma cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf fern, is a compact, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, dark green fronds that are densely covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Microgramma cordata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in shaded, humid environments."
