    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 subdicycla, commonly known as the hybrid sainfoin, is a perennial legume that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Medicago sativa and Medicago polyantha. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in forage systems due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. Additionally, its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
