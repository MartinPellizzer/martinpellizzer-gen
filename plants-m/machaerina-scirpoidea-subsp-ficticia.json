    "intro": "Machaerina scirpoidea subsp. ficticia, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to the moist, temperate climate of its native habitat. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the leaf sheaths. This subspecies is valued for its strong, fibrous leaves, which have been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for weaving and other crafts."
