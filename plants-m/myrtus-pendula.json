It features drooping branches covered in small, dark green leaves that give it a distinctive cascading appearance. The plant produces tiny white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the autumn. Myrtus pendula is evergreen, with fragrant foliage that has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
