    "intro": "Moraea minima, commonly known as the dwarf moraea, is a small, perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often in clusters at the end of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and small floral arrangements."
