    "intro": "Merostachys retrorsa, commonly known as the backward-pointing grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curl backward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
