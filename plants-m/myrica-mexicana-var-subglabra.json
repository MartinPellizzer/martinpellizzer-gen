    "intro": "Myrica mexicana var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and shiny, distinguishing it from other varieties of myrtle. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are clustered in dense, spherical formations. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils make it a notable species in arid and semi-arid environments. The smooth wax myrtle is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
