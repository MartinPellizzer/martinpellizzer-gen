    "intro": "Manganaroa martii, commonly known as the New Zealand mangrove, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows in brackish water environments, adapting to the fluctuating salinity levels of tidal zones. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its salty habitat. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered together, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Manganaroa martii is considered a critically endangered species."
