    "intro": "Miconia fuliginosa, commonly known as black miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries. It is often found in humid lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
