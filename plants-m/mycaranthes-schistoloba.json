It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, black seeds. This species is native to certain regions of Australia and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats."
