    "intro": "Milnea racemosa, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Asclepias, to which it belongs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture. Milnea racemosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
