    "intro": "Muscaria magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan puffball, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Gyromitraceae. It is characterized by its large, rounded cap that is typically white or pale yellow in color. The fruiting body is usually solitary and can grow up to 10 centimeters in diameter. It is found in temperate regions, particularly in South America, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Unlike its more famous relative, the death cap, it is not considered poisonous but is still often avoided due to its similarity in appearance."
