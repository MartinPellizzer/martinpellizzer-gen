    "intro": "Mitragyna stipulosa, commonly known as kratom, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which also includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves with prominent veins and a rough, fissured bark. Its leaves contain alkaloids, particularly mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which contribute to its medicinal and stimulant properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its leaves rather than its fruit."
