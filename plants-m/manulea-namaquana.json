    "intro": "Manulea namaquana, commonly known as the Namibian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the Namib Desert. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy and rocky soils, adapted to the extreme arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the brief rainy season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Manulea namaquana plays a vital role in stabilizing the desert landscape and providing shelter for small animals."
