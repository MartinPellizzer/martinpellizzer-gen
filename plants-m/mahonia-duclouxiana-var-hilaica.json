    "intro": "Mahonia duclouxiana var. hilaica, commonly known as Hilaic Mahonia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive form and seasonal color changes."
