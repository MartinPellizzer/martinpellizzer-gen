    "intro": "Miconia ossaeiformis, commonly known as the coral tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Miconia ossaeiformis is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common sight in tropical landscapes."
