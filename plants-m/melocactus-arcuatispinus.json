It features a cylindrical stem that is typically ribbed and covered in spines, which are often curved or hooked. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique spines and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
