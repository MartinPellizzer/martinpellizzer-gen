    "intro": "Melia americana, commonly known as the American bitternut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves and bark contain compounds with medicinal properties, though the plant is generally avoided due to its bitter and potentially harmful nature."
