    "intro": "Malpighia pasorealensis, commonly known as the Peruvian wolfberry, is a species of shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its small, red, fleshy berries that resemble those of the common wolfberry. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The fruit is edible, though it is less well-known than other members of the Malpighia genus."
