    "intro": "Minuartia umbellulifera subsp. salbacica, commonly known as the Salbacan sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on rocky soils or in sandy habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in extreme conditions."
