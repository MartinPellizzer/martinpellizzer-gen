    "intro": "Mentha falcata, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a strong menthol scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes. Mentha falcata thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb, though it is less common than garden mint."
