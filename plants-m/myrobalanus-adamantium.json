    "intro": "Myrobalanus adamantium, commonly known as the Indian persimmon, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often glossy and have a distinctive elliptical shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fruits resembling small, round persimmons, which are typically orange to red in color when ripe. The fruit is edible, though it contains a high concentration of tannins, making it bitter unless fully mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
