    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It features a stout, unbranched stem with a thick, fibrous trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
