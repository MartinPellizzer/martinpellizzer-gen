It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly spines and prominent areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Mammillaria arizonica is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
