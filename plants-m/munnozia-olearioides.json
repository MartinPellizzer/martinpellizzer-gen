    "intro": "Munnozia olearioides, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape, with dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Munnozia olearioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
