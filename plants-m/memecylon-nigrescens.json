    "intro": "Memecylon nigrescens, commonly known as black memecylon, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits that turn black when mature. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shady environments. Memecylon nigrescens is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
