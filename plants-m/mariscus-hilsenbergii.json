    "intro": "Mariscus hilsenbergii, commonly known as the Hilsenbeck's mariscus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the Apiaceae family. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mariscus hilsenbergii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
