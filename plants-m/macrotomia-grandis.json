    "intro": "Macrotomia grandis, commonly known as the giant splitleaf plant, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. Its stems are woody and often branched, supporting the massive foliage. While it is primarily grown as an ornamental plant, it also has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
