It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, often in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat.
