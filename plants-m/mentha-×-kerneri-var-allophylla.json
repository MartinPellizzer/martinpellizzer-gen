    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri var. allophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peppermint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, typically in late summer. Its aromatic foliage contains high concentrations of menthol, giving it a strong, refreshing scent. This variety is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses due to its potent essential oils."
