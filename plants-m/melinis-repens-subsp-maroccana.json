    "intro": "Melinis repens subsp. maroccana, commonly known as Moroccan carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a common weed and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
