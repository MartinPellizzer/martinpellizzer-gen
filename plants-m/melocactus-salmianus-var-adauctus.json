    "intro": "Melocactus salmianus var. adauctus, commonly known as the Salmi's melon cactus, is a rare and striking species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that can reach up to 30 cm in height, adorned with prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
