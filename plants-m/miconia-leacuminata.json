    "intro": "Miconia leacuminata, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or golden star, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive, almost star-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in certain regions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine."
