    "intro": "Menispermum oblongifolium, commonly known as Indian turnsole, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are often deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that ripen in the fall. Its roots contain alkaloids and have been used in traditional medicine, though it is toxic if ingested. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
