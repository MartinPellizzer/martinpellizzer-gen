It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Melanthium longiflorum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
