    "intro": "Miconia myricoides, commonly known as the yellow miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
