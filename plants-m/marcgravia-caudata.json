It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its long, trailing stems and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and typically have a yellowish or white color. Marcgravia caudata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to cascade from hanging baskets."
