    "intro": "Mitrasacme cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's mitrasacme, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, and it produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
