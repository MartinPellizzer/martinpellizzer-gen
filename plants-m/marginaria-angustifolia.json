    "intro": "Marginaria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marginaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers. Marginaria angustifolia is often found in coastal and inland regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
