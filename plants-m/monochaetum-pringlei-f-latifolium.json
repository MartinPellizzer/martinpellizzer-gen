    "intro": "Monochaetum pringlei f. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved monochaetum, is a rare and distinctive plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
