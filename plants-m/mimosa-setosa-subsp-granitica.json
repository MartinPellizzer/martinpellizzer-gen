    "intro": "Mimosa setosa subsp. granitica, commonly known as the granitic mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided and covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in globular inflorescences, which are typically visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
