    "intro": "Miconia cajanumana, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries.

However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
