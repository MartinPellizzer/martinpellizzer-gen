    "intro": "Mormodes frymirei, commonly known as the Frymire's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that feature a distinctive lip, a key feature in orchid taxonomy. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical structure includes long, strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulb-like stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
