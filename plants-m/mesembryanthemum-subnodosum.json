    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum subnodosum, commonly known as the nodding ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in winter. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
