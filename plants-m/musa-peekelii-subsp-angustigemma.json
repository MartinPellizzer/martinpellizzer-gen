    "intro": "Musa peekelii subsp. angustigemma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banana, is a rare and less commonly cultivated member of the Musa genus. It is native to the lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are narrower than those of most other banana species. It produces small, clustered inflorescences and has a unique, compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but under-researched species in botanical studies."
