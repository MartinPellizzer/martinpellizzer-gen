    "intro": "Mentzelia integrifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have smooth margins, though some varieties may exhibit slight toothed edges. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
