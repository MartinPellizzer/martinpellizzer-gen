    "intro": "Mimulus dudleyi, commonly known as the Dudley's monkeyflower, is a species native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual plant with striking orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mimulus dudleyi plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
