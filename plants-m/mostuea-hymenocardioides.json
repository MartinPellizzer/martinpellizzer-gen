    "intro": "Mostuea hymenocardioides, commonly known as the red ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mostuea hymenocardioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor spaces."
