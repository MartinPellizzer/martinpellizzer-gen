    "intro": "Muscari neglectum subsp. speciosum, commonly known as the Persian bluebell, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, bluish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in woodland and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display. The subspecies is closely related to other muscari species but is distinguished by its more robust growth and showy inflorescence."
