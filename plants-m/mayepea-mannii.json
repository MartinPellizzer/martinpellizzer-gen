    "intro": "Mayepea mannii, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a tropical plant native to western and central Africa. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fruit, which contain oil-rich seeds used for both culinary and industrial purposes. Mayepea mannii thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires significant sunlight for optimal growth. Its economic importance is largely due to the production of palm oil, a key commodity in global markets."
