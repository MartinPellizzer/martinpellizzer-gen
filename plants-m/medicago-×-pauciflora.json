    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a hybrid legume species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a forage crop or for soil improvement."
