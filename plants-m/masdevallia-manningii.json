    "intro": "Masdevallia manningii, commonly known as the Manning's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often brightly colored flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms during the cooler months, producing fragrant, showy flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
