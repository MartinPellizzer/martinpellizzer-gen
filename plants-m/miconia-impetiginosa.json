    "intro": "Miconia impetiginosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by dark purple to black fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
