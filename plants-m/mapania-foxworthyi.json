    "intro": "Mapania foxworthyi, commonly known as the Foxworth's mapania, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
