    "intro": "Macrosiphonia martii, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe, often growing on rocky shores and sandy beaches. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture that helps it withstand salty air and strong winds. Macrosiphonia martii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various coastal insects and birds."
