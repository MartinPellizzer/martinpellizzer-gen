It has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, often spreading quickly through climbing stems and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
