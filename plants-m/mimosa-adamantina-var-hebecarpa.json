It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
