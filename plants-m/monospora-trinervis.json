    "intro": "Monospora trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's leaves are typically divided into three main veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
