It features clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces small, round bulbs that multiply over time. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Muscari dolichanthum is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact size and ornamental value."
