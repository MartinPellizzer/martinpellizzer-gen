    "intro": "Myriopteris mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican cliff brake, is a fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found on cliffs or in rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori that are covered by a thin indusium. Myriopteris mexicana is an evergreen fern that plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
