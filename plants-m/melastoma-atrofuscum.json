    "intro": "Melastoma atrofuscum, commonly known as black-stemmed melastoma, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its dark, often glossy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in moist, shaded environments. Melastoma atrofuscum is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
