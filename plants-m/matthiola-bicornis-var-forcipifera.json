    "intro": "Matthiola bicornis var. forcipifera, commonly known as the double-flowered wallflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of bi-colored, double flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces small, elongated fruits called silique, which contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early autumn."
