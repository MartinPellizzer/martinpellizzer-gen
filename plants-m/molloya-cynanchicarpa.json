    "intro": "Molloya cynanchicarpa, commonly known as the purpleleaf nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features distinctive violet-blue leaves and produces showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in full sun. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids that can cause severe illness if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is valued in some regions for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
