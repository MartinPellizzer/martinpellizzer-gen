    "intro": "Mabea elata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Mabea elata is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly sought after in traditional and contemporary crafts. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
