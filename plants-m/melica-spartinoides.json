    "intro": "Melica spartinoides, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often grow in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets, which are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Melica spartinoides thrives in maritime environments, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal prairies. Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for specialized wildlife."
