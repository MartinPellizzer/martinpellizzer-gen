    "intro": "Miconia neocoloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
