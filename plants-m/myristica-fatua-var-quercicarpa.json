It is characterized by its rough, woody fruit capsules that resemble small, spiky balls. The plant produces small, white flowers and has alternate, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. Its seeds are enclosed within the hard, three-lobed fruit, which splits open when mature. The species is often found in moist, shaded environments within lowland forests."
