    "intro": "Mikania florida, commonly known as the showy Mikania, is a fast-growing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in disturbed areas. Despite its aggressive spread, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
