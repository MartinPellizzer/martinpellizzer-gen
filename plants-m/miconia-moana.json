    "intro": "Miconia moana, commonly known as the Tahitian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the islands of French Polynesia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife and humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
