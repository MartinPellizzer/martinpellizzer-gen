    "intro": "Megistostigma malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees."
