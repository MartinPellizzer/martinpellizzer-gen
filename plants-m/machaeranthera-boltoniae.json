    "intro": "Machaeranthera boltoniae, commonly known as the Bolton's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
