    "intro": "Medicago pusilla, commonly known as dwarf sainfoin, is a small annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It has a deep root system that allows it to tolerate drought conditions and is used in some agricultural settings for forage. Medicago pusilla is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
