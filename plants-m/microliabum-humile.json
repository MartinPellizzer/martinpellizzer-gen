    "intro": "Microliabum humile, commonly known as the dwarf microliabum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Microliabum humile is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
