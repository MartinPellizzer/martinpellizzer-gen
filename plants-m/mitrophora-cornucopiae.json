    "intro": "Mitrophora cornucopiae, commonly known as the horned bellflower, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like floral structures that resemble a horned cup, giving it its common name. The plant features vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Mitrophora cornucopiae is a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its showy and often bell-shaped flowers."
