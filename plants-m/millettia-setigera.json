    "intro": "Millettia setigera, commonly known as the slender millettia, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It features compound leaves with 7 to 15 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivores and its potential use in traditional medicine."
