    "intro": "Myrica usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Myricaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and ecological studies."
