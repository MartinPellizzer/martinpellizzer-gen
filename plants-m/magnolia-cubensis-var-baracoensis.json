    "intro": "Magnolia cubensis var. baracoensis, commonly known as the Cuban magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to Cuba. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive fragrance. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with thick, ridged bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
