    "intro": "Mediocalcar longipes, commonly known as the long-footed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular, violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Mediocalcar longipes plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in coastal and desert scrub habitats."
