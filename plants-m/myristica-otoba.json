    "intro": "Myristica otoba, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a unique fruit that encloses a single, large, oily seed, which is the source of the edible nuts. The tree is also valued for its aromatic bark and leaves, which have been used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a keystone species in the Amazonian ecosystem."
