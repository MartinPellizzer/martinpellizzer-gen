    "intro": "Matricaria pichleri, commonly known as the Alpine chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Matricaria pichleri is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its calming effects."
