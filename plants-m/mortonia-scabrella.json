    "intro": "Mortonia scabrella, commonly known as the rough-skinned lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its survival in nutrient-poor substrates. Its growth is typically slow, and it can be found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. Mortonia scabrella plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms."
