    "intro": "Mendoncia schwackeana, commonly known as the Schwacke's mendoncia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its tubular, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
