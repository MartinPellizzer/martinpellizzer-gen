It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. These plants are characterized by their attractive, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Mongezia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
