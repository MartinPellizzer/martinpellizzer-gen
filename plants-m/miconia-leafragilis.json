    "intro": "Miconia leafragilis, commonly known as the brittle leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some areas where it has been introduced."
