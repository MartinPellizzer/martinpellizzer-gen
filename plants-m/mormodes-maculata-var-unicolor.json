    "intro": "Mormodes maculata var. unicolor, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native environment."
