The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
