It is characterized by its large, showy red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This species is valued in horticulture for its vibrant color and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
