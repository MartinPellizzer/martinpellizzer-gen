    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. pannonica, commonly known as Hungarian water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves with a strong minty scent and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent colonizer of wet habitats. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and cooling properties."
