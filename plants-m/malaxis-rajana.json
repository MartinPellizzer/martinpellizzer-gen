    "intro": "Malaxis rajana, commonly known as the Rajan's Malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the Himalayan regions of India. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique floral structure that features a slender, greenish-yellow scape and narrow, lanceolate leaves. The flowers are typically pale green or yellowish with a distinctive, spurred lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis rajana is considered a rare and endangered species."
