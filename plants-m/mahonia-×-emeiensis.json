    "intro": "Mahonia \u00d7 emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei mahonia, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its compound, spiny leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Mahonia \u00d7 emeiensis is relatively low maintenance and drought-tolerant once established."
