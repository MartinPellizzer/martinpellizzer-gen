    "intro": "Myrtus coccolobifolia, commonly known as the coastal myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale blue or white, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal winds. Myrtus coccolobifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
