    "intro": "Meliosma simplicifolia subsp. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaf meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elliptic, winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its foliage provides habitat for various insects, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
