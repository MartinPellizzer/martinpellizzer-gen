It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salty coastal environments, showing resistance to drought and salt spray. Marlea costata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
