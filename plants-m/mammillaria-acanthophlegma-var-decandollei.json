It features a globular shape with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for desert gardens. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
