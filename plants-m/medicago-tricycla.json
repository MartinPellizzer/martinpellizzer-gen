    "intro": "Medicago tricycla, commonly known as Turkey rhubarb, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Medicago tricycla is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
