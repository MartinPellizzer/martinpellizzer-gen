    "intro": "Mimosa malacocarpa, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small, soft leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage and flowering habits."
