It typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. The shrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
