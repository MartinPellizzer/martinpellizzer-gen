    "intro": "Melaleuca acerosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which are borne in clusters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs. Melaleuca acerosa is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
