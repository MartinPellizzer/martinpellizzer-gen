    "intro": "Miconia crocina, commonly known as the red miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a waxy texture and a deep green color. The plant produces showy, red-orange inflorescences that are highly visible and attract various pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
