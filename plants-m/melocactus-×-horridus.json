    "intro": "Melocactus \u00d7 horridus, commonly known as the hairy devil's claw, is a hybrid cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and dense covering of white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection from intense sunlight. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in late summer and are followed by small, red fruits. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
