    "intro": "Melocactus oaxacensis, commonly known as the Oaxacan melon cactus, is a species native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces a single, large, yellow or orange fruit that resembles a melon, which is edible and has a sweet, melon-like flavor. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in the evening. This cactus is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water to thrive."
