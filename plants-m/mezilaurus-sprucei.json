    "intro": "Mezilaurus sprucei, commonly known as the African mountain ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests. Due to its rarity and slow growth, it is highly valued for its timber and is threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
