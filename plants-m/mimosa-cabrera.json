    "intro": "Mimosa cabrera, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets arranged along a central axis. Mimosa cabrera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
