    "intro": "Monticalia ledifolia var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly monticalia, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually alternate and elliptical, with a waxy surface that contributes to its overall resilience. This species is often found in shaded, understory habitats within rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity and nutrient-rich soils."
