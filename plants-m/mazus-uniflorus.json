    "intro": "Mazus uniflorus, commonly known as the one-flowered mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Mazus uniflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
