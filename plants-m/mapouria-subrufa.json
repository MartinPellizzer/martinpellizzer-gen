    "intro": "Mapouria subrufa, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with deep red veins that contrast with its green or yellowish foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Mapouria subrufa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage."
