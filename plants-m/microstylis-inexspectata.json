It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
