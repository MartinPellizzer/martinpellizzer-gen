    "intro": "Monnina franchetii, commonly known as redstem flax or redstem sida, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the species. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Monnina franchetii is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
