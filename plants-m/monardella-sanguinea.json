It is characterized by its striking red to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Monardella sanguinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
