    "intro": "Mays vulgaris, commonly known as corn, is a tall annual grass native to the Americas. It produces large, clustered inflorescences called ears, which contain rows of kernels covered in a protective husk. The plant is cultivated worldwide for its starchy kernels, which are used in food, animal feed, and industrial products. Its growth cycle includes a rapid vegetative phase followed by flowering and grain development. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous stalks, narrow leaves, and a complex reproductive structure."
