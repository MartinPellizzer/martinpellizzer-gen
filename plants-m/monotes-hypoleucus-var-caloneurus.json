    "intro": "Monotes hypoleucus var. caloneurus, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, though it is a food source for certain butterfly species. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions."
