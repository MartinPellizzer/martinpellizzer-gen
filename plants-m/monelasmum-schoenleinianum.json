    "intro": "Monelasmum schoenleinianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions of Central and South America and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
