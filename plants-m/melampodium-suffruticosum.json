    "intro": "Melampodium suffruticosum, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often hairy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow, tubular corolla and a prominent, cone-shaped disk in the center. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
