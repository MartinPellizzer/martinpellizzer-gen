    "intro": "Merremia kuhlmannii, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
