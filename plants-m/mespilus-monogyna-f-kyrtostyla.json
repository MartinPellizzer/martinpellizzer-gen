It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated styles that give it its unique appearance. This form is typically found in specific geographic regions, often in mountainous or forested areas. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries in late summer. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its native environment, making it a notable subject in botanical studies."
