    "intro": "Myristica andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman nut or bisara, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and large, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing the highly prized nut inside. The nut is rich in oils and has been traditionally used for culinary and medicinal purposes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
