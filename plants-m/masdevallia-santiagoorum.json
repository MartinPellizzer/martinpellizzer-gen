    "intro": "Masdevallia santiagoorum, commonly known as the Santiago orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of southern Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure with elongated petals and a striking, often brightly colored lip. The plant typically grows as a small epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in spring and are known for their delicate, almost ethereal appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
