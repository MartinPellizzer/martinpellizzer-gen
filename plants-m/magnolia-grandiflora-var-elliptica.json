    "intro": "Magnolia grandiflora var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard magnolia. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers in the spring, which are clustered at the base of the leaves. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
