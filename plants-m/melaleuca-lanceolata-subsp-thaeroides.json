    "intro": "Melaleuca lanceolata subsp. thaeroides, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking spikes of bright red or pink flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance contribute to its use in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
