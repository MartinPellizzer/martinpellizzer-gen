It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pink, followed by round, fleshy berries. Miconia dolichantha is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it can become invasive in some regions, posing a threat to native plant communities."
