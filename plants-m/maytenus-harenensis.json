    "intro": "Maytenus harenensis, commonly known as the Haren's mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Maytenus in the family Celastraceae. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife."
