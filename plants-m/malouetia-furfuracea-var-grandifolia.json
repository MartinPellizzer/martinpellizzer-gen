It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
