It is a small, globular cactus with a gray-green stem covered in white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
