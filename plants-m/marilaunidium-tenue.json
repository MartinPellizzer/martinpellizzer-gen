    "intro": "Marilaunidium tenue, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features a slender, erect stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Marilaunidium tenue is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity."
