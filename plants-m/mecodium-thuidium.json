    "intro": "Mecodium thuidium, commonly known as the sticky sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in a sticky resin, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted for storing water, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Mecodium thuidium is often cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
