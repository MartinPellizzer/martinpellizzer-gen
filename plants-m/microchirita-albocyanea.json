    "intro": "Microchirita albocyanea, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters, with white petals and pale blue sepals. The plant has a slender, upright stem and produces lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
