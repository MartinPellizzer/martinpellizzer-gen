    "intro": "Muscari theraeum, commonly known as the Persian grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is well-suited for rock gardens or borders. Muscari theraeum is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for gardeners."
