    "intro": "Marica coelestis, commonly known as the sky-blue marica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Marica coelestis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
