    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum citrinum, commonly known as the yellow mesem, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its fleshy, water-storing leaves help it survive in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
