It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and distinctive red, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
