    "intro": "Micractis schimperi, commonly known as the blue sea urchin, is a species of sea urchin found in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Diadematidae and is characterized by its spiny, globular body covered in short, sharp spines. The test, or skeletal structure, is made of calcite and is covered with a layer of ambulacral plates. It has a distinctive blue coloration due to the presence of chromatophores in its skin. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the breakdown of algae and serving as prey for various predators."
