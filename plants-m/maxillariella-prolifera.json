    "intro": "Maxillariella prolifera, commonly known as the clustered lady's slipper orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with short, horizontal rhizomes and produces compact, hairy pseudobulbs. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white pubescence. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically pink or white, with a distinctive pouch-like lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates for optimal growth."
