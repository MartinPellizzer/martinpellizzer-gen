    "intro": "Monochoria loureiroi, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has distinctive rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas, impacting local ecosystems."
