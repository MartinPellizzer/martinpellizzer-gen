    "intro": "Masdevallia velox, commonly known as the swift masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, erect pseudobulbs that support narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers in shades of pink and purple, often with contrasting white markings. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
