It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically oval in shape, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple, blooming during the cooler months. Mahernia ovalis is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
