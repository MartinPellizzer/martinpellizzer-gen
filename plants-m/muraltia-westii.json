It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. Muraltia westii thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
