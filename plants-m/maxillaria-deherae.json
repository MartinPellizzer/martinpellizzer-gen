    "intro": "Maxillaria deherae, commonly known as the Dehera's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pendulous, showy blooms in shades of pink and white, often with contrasting yellow markings. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, supporting its evergreen foliage, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for epiphytic growth. Maxillaria deherae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
