It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its woody stem, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. Mascagnia elegans is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
