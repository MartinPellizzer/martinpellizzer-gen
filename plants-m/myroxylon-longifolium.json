    "intro": "Myroxylon longifolium, commonly known as the Copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces a fragrant resin that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and can grow up to 30 meters tall. Its bark and sap are rich in compounds with potential antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as a vulnerable species."
