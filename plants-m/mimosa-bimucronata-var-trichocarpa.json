    "intro": "Mimosa bimucronata var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy gray-green foliage and its distinctive, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique response to touch, known as thigmonasty, is a fascinating botanical feature."
