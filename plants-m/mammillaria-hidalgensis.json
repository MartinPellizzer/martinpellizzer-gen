    "intro": "Mammillaria hidalgensis, commonly known as the Hidalgo prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, ribbed stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits that are often used in local cuisine. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal water once established."
