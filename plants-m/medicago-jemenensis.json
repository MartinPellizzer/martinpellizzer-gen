    "intro": "Medicago jemenensis, commonly known as the Yemen clover, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It plays a role in soil stabilization and can be used in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and sandy terrains."
