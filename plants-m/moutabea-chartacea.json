    "intro": "Moutabea chartacea, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing flat, oblong seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in incense and traditional medicine."
