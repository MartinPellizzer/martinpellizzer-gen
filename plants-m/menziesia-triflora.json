    "intro": "Menziesia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, typically in clusters of three, which give it its common name. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Menziesia triflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
