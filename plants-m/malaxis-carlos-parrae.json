    "intro": "Malaxis carlos-parrae, commonly known as the Carlos-Parra Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions with partial shade. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
