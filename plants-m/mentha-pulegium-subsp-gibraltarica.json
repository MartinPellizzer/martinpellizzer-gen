It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming and digestive properties.
