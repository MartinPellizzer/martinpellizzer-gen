    "intro": "Medicago scutellaris, commonly known as lesser medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil improvement and as a forage plant. Medicago scutellaris is also an important species in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and hardiness."
