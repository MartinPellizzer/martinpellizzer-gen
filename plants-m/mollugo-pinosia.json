    "intro": "Mollugo pinosia, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed coastal areas. Mollugo pinosia is adapted to salt spray and high winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments."
