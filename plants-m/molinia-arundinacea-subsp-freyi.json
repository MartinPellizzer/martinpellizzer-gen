    "intro": "Molinia arundinacea subsp. freyi, commonly known as frey's moor grass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in wet meadows, bogs, and heaths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
