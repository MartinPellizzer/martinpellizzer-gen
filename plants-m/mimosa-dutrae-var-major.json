    "intro": "Mimosa dutrae var. major, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a shrub native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and behavior, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
