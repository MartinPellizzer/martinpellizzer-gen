    "intro": "Miconia subnodosa, commonly known as the glossy miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by purple-black berries. Miconia subnodosa is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
