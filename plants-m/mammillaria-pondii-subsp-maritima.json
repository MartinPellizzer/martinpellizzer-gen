    "intro": "Mammillaria pondii subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as a decorative and resilient succulent in arid environments."
