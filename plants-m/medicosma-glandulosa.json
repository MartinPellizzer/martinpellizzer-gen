    "intro": "Medicosma glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems covered in glandular hairs that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments. Medicosma glandulosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
