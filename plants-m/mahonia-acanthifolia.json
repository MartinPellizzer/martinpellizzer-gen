    "intro": "Mahonia acanthifolia, commonly known as the thorned mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with spiny margins. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in colder climates."
