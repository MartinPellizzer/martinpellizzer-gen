    "intro": "Melhania ovata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain melhania, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stem and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
