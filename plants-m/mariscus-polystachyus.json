    "intro": "Mariscus polystachyus, commonly known as the mountain holly or holly fern, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, dark green leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a valuable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
