    "intro": "Manihot hassleriana, commonly known as the Hassler's manioc, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are used traditionally for their starchy content, though they contain toxic compounds that require processing. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
