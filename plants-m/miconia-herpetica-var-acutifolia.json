It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
