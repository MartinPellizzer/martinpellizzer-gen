    "intro": "Magnolia nitida, commonly known as the glossy magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge, providing an attractive appearance throughout the growing season. The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the contrast between its delicate flowers and its lush, evergreen foliage."
