    "intro": "Muraltia lignosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
