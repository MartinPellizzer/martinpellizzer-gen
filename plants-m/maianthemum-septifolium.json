    "intro": "Maianthemum septifolium, commonly known as the seven-leaved wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features a rosette of dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white veining pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in late spring, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in shady, moist woodland environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense ground cover."
