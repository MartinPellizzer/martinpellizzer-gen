It features whorled leaves that are typically narrow and green, with a soft, feathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense underwater vegetation."
