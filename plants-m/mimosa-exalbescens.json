    "intro": "Mimosa exalbescens, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold when touched. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
