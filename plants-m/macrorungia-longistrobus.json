    "intro": "Macrorungia longistrobus, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks or in shaded forest floors. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in horticulture, though it faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
