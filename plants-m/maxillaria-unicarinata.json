    "intro": "Maxillaria unicarinata, commonly known as the single-ribbed maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its flowers are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive single ridge on the lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria unicarinata is a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
