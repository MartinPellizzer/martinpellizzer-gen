    "intro": "Microtatorchis longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed fern, is a unique species characterized by its elongated, slender fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, using its rhizomes to anchor itself to trees or other structures. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's ability to thrive in high humidity and partial shade makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
