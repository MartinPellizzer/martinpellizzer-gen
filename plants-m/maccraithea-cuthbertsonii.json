It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
