    "intro": "Manulea cephalotes, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with a prominent, helmet-like lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and brightly colored, ranging from yellow to orange, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Manulea cephalotes is considered a rare and endangered species."
