It features narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that are typically variegated with white or yellow margins. The plant is prized for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is relatively drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often used in indoor gardening and as a decorative ground cover in shaded outdoor spaces."
