    "intro": "Miconia formicocollina, commonly known as the ant-covered miconia, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered with colonies of ants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds. Miconia formicocollina is notable for its ecological relationship with ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food."
