    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. arenaria, commonly known as coastal medick, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores, dunes, and salt marshes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, saline environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it valuable for coastal restoration projects. It is also an important forage plant for livestock in arid and semi-arid regions."
