It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid tropical environment. The orchid thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of the rainforest."
