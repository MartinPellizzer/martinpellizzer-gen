It is characterized by its large, fleshy, segmented pseudostems composed of tightly packed leaf sheaths. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically hidden within the heart of the plant before the fruit develops. The fruit, which is the familiar banana, is a composite of individual berries fused together. Musa lokok is cultivated for its edible fruit and is an important crop in many tropical regions."
