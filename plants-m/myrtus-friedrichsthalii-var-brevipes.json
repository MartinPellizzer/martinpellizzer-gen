It features small, dark green leaves that are aromatic and covered in a fine, white powdery bloom. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers that give way to small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and evergreen nature."
