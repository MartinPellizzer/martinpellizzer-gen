    "intro": "Mammillaria elegans var. lupina, commonly known as the wolf's milk cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
