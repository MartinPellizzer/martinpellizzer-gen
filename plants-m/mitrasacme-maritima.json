    "intro": "Mitrasacme maritima, commonly known as the coastal mitrasacme, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Mitrasacme maritima is adapted to thrive in harsh, maritime conditions, making it a resilient species of the coastal ecosystem."
