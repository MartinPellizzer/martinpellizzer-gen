It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture and a reddish tinge. Mazus procumbens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas."
