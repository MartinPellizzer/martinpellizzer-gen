    "intro": "Mammea congregata, commonly known as the Hawaiian mammea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in its native habitat."
