    "intro": "Meneghinia alba, commonly known as the white marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae (grass) family. Meneghinia alba plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
