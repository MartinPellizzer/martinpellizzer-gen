It is characterized by its delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. This variation of the forget-me-not is noted for its color variation in flowers, which can range from white to deep blue."
