It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. Its seeds are encased in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
