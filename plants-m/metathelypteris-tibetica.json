    "intro": "Metathelypteris tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and neighboring areas. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for propagation. Its leaves are typically bi-lobed and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Metathelypteris tibetica plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting aquatic biodiversity and serving as an indicator of water quality."
