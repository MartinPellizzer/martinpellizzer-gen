    "intro": "Minuartia sclerantha, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in poor soils and full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in arid climates make it a resilient species in mountainous regions. Minuartia sclerantha plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones."
