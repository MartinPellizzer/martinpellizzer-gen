    "intro": "Masdevallia vilcabambensis, commonly known as the Vilcabamba masdevallia, is a rare orchid native to the cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
