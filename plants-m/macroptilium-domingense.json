    "intro": "Macroptilium domingense, commonly known as the Dominican velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is notable for its distinctive, velvety pods that contain edible seeds used in traditional medicine and as a protein source. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
