    "intro": "Marsilea tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in water gardens."
