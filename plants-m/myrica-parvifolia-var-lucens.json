    "intro": "Myrica parvifolia var. lucens, commonly known as the shining waxmyrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The shrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
