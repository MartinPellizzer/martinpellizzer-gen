    "intro": "Masdevallia pleurothalloides, commonly known as the pleurothalloides masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers that display a unique blend of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded environment. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
