    "intro": "Miconia detergibilis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces berries that are orange-red in color and contain several seeds. It is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas due to its adaptability to various soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
