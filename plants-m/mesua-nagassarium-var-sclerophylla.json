It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing before or during the rainy season. The leaves are narrow and leathery, which is a typical feature of sclerophyllous plants adapted to dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. This species is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
