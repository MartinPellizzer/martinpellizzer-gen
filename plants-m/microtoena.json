    "intro": "Microtoena, commonly known as the lesser lily of the valley, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small, herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green. Microtoena species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Their ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens make them popular in horticulture."
