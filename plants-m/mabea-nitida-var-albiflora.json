    "intro": "Mabea nitida var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered mabea, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and hairy stems. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in forest understories. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds."
