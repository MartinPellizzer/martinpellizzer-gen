    "intro": "Mariscus distichus, commonly known as the two-leaved mariscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its opposite, linear leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Mariscus distichus is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in riparian zones."
