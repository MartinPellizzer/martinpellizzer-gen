    "intro": "Masdevallia setipes, commonly known as the spurred masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces intricate, fragrant flowers with elongated, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention. The flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring, are prized for their unique shape and coloration in horticultural collections."
