    "intro": "Minuartia glomerata subsp. velutina, commonly known as the velvet rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered with a soft, velvety hair that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. This subspecies is often found in open, sunny habitats such as tundra and mountain slopes."
