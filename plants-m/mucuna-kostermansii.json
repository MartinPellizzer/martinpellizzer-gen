    "intro": "Mucuna kostermansii, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural settings. However, its seeds contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
