    "intro": "Mimulus rivularis, commonly known as the water yellowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America. It typically grows in stream banks, wet meadows, and other waterlogged habitats. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its most distinctive characteristic is its bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mimulus rivularis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
