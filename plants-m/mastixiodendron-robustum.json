    "intro": "Mastixiodendron robustum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
