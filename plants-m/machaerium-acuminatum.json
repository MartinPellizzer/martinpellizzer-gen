    "intro": "Machaerium acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved machaerium, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Machaerium acuminatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions for medicinal purposes."
