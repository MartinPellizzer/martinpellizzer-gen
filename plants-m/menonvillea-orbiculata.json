It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and dense arrangement of small, spiny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and succulent gardens."
