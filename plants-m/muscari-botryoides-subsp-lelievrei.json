It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that resemble tiny grapes, hence its common name. The plant produces strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and early spring blooming habit."
