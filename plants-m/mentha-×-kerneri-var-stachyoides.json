    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri var. stachyoides, commonly known as the stachyoid horse mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its aromatic leaves contain menthol and other volatile oils, making it valuable for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
