    "intro": "Mariscus cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's mariscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a reddish tinge, especially when mature. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mariscus cooperi is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
