It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is typically found in moist, temperate regions. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
