It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered with small, scale-like structures called squamules, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Mertensia squamulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
