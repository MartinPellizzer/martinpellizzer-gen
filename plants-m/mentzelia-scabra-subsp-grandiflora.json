    "intro": "Mentzelia scabra subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of Mentzelia scabra."
