    "intro": "Mulguraea aspera var. aspera, commonly known as the rough mulguraea, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in a rough, glandular texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive prolonged droughts. Mulguraea aspera var. aspera plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
