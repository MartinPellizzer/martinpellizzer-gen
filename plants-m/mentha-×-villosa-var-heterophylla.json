    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. heterophylla, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that vary in shape and size, giving it the varietal name *heterophylla*. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Catnip is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically for its calming effects on both humans and animals."
