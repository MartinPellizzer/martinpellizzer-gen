    "intro": "Melaleuca scandens, commonly known as the weeping honeymyrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of fluffy, pink or cream-colored flowers, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often peeling in thin layers. Melaleuca scandens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
