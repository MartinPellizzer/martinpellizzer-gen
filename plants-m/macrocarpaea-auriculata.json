    "intro": "Macrocarpaea auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped ivy, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its ability to climb or trail makes it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in humid climates."
