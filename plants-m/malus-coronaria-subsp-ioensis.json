    "intro": "Malus coronaria subsp. ioensis, commonly known as the Ioensis apple or the New Zealand crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of white to pink. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for gardens and landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its showy blossoms and historical significance in New Zealand's flora."
