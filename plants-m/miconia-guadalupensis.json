    "intro": "Miconia guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupan miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean island of Guadalupe. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
