    "intro": "Myrteola nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, berry-like fruits. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. Myrteola nummularia thrives in well-drained soils and is suited to warm, sunny climates."
