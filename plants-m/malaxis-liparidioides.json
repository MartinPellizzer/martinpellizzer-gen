    "intro": "Malaxis liparidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is characterized by its lack of a visible stem and its ability to form pseudobulbs for water storage. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
