    "intro": "Melaleuca scoparia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spikes, which bloom from late summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface. Melaleuca scoparia is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
