    "intro": "Maytenus blepharodes, commonly known as the Brazilian white cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Maytenus blepharodes is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
