    "intro": "Mendoncia steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's mendoncia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring well-drained environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled spheres. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
