    "intro": "Mimosa rudis var. asperrima, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaflets and thorny stems. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species. This variation is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
