    "intro": "Marina sarodes, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found growing along shores and in brackish water areas. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it a hardy species suitable for coastal landscaping. Marina sarodes is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
