    "intro": "Maesa pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved maesa, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Maesa pachyphylla is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses."
