    "intro": "Manihot brachyloba, commonly known as the short-leaf arrowleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
