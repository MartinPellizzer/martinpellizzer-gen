    "intro": "Mimulus langsdorffii var. argutus, commonly known as the rough monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glandular-stemmed, hairy foliage and showy, orange to red tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as streambanks and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variant is distinguished by its more rugged, hairy leaves compared to other Mimulus species."
