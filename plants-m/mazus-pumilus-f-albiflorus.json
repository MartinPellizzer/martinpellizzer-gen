    "intro": "Mazus pumilus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered mossyweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming foliage and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a short, creeping stem and a preference for moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
