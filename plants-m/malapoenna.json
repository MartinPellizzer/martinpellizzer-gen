    "intro": "Malapoenna, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often forming a compact rosette of leaves. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, blue, and white, and are pollinated by insects. Malapoenna thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
