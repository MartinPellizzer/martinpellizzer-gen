    "intro": "Mimosa chrysostachys, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has a sprawling growth habit and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Mimosa chrysostachys is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
