    "intro": "Mimosa bimucronata var. hexandra, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that split open when mature, releasing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
