    "intro": "Melica tenuis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica tenuis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
