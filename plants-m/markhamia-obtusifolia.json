It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the dry season. Markhamia obtusifolia is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient species found in montane grasslands and woodlands."
