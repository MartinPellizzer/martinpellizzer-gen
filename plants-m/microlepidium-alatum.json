It is characterized by its narrow, silver-tinged leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and texture. Microlepidium alatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
