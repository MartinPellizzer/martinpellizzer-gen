    "intro": "Malaxis elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's Malaxis, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, fibrous rhizome and a single, often hairy leaf. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis elmeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
