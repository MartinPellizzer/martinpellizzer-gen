    "intro": "Medicago polonica, commonly known as the Polish clover, is a perennial legume native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, and it is often found in meadows and grasslands. Medicago polonica has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
