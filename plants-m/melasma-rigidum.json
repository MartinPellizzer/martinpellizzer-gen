    "intro": "Melasma rigidum, commonly known as the rigid lichen, is a unique plant characterized by its dense, woody structure. It is a type of lichen, a symbiotic organism formed by a partnership between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocks. Its rigid, crust-like morphology provides protection against environmental stressors. Melasma rigidum is often found in temperate and tropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
