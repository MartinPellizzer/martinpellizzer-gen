    "intro": "Malvastrum ulophyllum, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
