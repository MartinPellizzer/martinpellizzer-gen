    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. annularis, commonly known as the ringed goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive ring-shaped leaves and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
