    "intro": "Magnolia jinggangshanensis, commonly known as the Jinggangshan magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Jiangxi Province in China. It is characterized by its large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant is a deciduous tree with thick, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
