    "intro": "Marsupiaria angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy areas of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones and floodplain environments. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
