    "intro": "Millina leontodontoides, commonly known as the leopard's ear, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that resemble the spotted pattern of a leopard's ear, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and gardens."
