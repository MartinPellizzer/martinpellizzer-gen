    "intro": "Malaxis hoppii, commonly known as the Hoppi's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of the Malaxis genus. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
