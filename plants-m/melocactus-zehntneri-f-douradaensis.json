    "intro": "Melocactus zehntneri f. douradaensis, commonly known as the Golden Dourada Melocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense, spiny areoles that bear white or yellow bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for collectors. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in the wild."
