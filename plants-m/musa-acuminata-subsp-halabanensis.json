    "intro": "Musa acuminata subsp. halabanensis, commonly known as the Halaban banana, is a wild banana species native to the island of Halaban in the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It is a member of the Musaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and edible, elongated fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its fruit, which has a distinct flavor and texture compared to common bananas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially valuable genetic resource for banana breeding programs."
