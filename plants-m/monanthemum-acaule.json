It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, erect stem with a cluster of small, showy flowers at the top. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
