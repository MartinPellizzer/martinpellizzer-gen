    "intro": "Melicope petrophila, commonly known as the rock melicope, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, often on cliffs or slopes. It has a unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which is an adaptation to its native environment. Melicope petrophila is also considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species."
