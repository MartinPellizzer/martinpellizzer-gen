    "intro": "Myriopteris marsupianthes var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf marsh fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and wetlands. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are usually less than 15 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Myriopteris marsupianthes."
