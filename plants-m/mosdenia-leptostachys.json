It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
