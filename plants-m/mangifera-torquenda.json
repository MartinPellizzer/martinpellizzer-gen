    "intro": "Mangifera torquenda, commonly known as the twisted mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunk and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible, yellow-orange fruits. Its fruit has a fibrous pulp and is often used in local cuisines. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Mangifera torquenda is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
