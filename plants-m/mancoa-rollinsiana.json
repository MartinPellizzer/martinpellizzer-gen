    "intro": "Mancoa rollinsiana, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
