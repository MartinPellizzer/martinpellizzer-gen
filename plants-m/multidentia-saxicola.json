    "intro": "Multidentia saxicola, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky environments. It features a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. It produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
