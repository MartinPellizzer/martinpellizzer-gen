    "intro": "Madia hallii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater. Its flowers are composed of many tiny florets arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Madia hallii plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
