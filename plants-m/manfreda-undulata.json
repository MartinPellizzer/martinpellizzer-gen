    "intro": "Manfreda undulata, commonly known as the wavy manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and have a wavy or undulating edge, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its drought tolerance and unique appearance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping efforts."
