    "intro": "Myrtus resupinata, commonly known as the prostrate myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slight aromatic scent. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Myrtus resupinata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
