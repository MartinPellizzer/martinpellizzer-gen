    "intro": "Microterangis hariotiana, commonly known as the Mount Lofty mountain apple, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, spherical seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
