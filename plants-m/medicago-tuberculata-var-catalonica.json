    "intro": "Medicago tuberculata var. catalonica, commonly known as the Catalan clover, is a perennial legume native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its distinctive tuberculate (wart-like) leaves help distinguish it from other clover species."
