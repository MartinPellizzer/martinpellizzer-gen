    "intro": "Molinia simonii var. major, commonly known as the tall moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and bogs of northern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish spikelets, which are typically arranged in a panicle inflorescence. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is an important component of peatland ecosystems. Due to its ecological significance, it is often used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
