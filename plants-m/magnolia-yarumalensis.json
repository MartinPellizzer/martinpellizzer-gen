It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it prefers cool, moist habitats in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
