    "intro": "Miconia benthamiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia benthamiana is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of humid environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
