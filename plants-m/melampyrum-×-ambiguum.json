It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant features distinctive red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and slightly hairy, with a lanceolate shape. The hybrid is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting pollinators."
