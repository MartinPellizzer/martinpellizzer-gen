    "intro": "Melorima cirrhosa, commonly known as the silver-haired bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Melorima cirrhosa is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
