    "intro": "Mammillaria elegans var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish woolly covering that covers the stems and areoles, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which emerge from the areoles. Its spines are typically white or yellow and are short and sparse. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
