    "intro": "Medicago sativa subsp. viscosa, commonly known as viscosa medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose racemes, followed by oblong, green pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This subspecies is valued for its forage quality and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
