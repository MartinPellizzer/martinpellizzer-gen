    "intro": "Mimulus ampliatus, commonly known as the broadleaf monkeyflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant produces showy, orange to yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture. Mimulus ampliatus plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is often found in conservation areas due to its ecological value."
