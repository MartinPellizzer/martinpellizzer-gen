    "intro": "Malmea macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited malmea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Malmea macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
