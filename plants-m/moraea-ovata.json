It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
