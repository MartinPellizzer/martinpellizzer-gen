    "intro": "Malva dethardingii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and succulent leaves. Malva dethardingii is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy species that thrives in full sun."
