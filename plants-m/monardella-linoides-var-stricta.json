It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is part of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is reflected in its aromatic foliage. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other varieties of Monardella."
