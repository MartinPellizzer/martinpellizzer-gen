    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals, and appear in early spring. This subspecies is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on limestone or sandy substrates. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine and steppe habitats."
