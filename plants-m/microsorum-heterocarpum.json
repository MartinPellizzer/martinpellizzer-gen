    "intro": "Microsorum heterocarpum, commonly known as the heterocarpum sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that grow in a dense, bushy form. The plant typically thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to stabilize substrates. The plant's unique reproductive structures, including its heterocarpous spores, contribute to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
