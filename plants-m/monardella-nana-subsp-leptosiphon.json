    "intro": "Monardella nana subsp. leptosiphon, commonly known as dwarf monardella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for pollinators and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
