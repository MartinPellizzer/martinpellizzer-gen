    "intro": "Monilaria obconica, commonly known as the pink mohair lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive pinkish to reddish coloration due to its unique pigmentation. The thallus is leathery and often forms dense, cushion-like growths on tree bark or soil. It is characterized by its branched, filamentous rhizines that anchor it to substrates. This lichen is widely distributed in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions."
