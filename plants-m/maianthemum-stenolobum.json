    "intro": "Maianthemum stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false lily of the wall, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often forming dense colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
