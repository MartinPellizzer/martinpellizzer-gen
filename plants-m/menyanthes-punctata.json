    "intro": "Menyanthes punctata, commonly known as the water pimpernel, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its name derives from the Greek \"menyanthes,\" meaning \"moon flower,\" likely due to its tendency to close its flowers at night. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
