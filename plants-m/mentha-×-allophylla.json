It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers appear in whorled clusters at the leaf axils. Mentha \u00d7 allophylla is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
