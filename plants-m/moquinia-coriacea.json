    "intro": "Moquinia coriacea, commonly known as the rough moquinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes and swampy areas. Moquinia coriacea is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
