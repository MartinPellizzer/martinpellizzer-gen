    "intro": "Micromeria brownei var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in arid ecosystems."
