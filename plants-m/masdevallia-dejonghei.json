    "intro": "Masdevallia dejonghei, commonly known as the De Jongh's masdevallia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated pseudobulbs and clusters of small, intricately shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, making it a challenging species for cultivation. Its unique morphology and limited distribution contribute to its status as a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its habitat specificity and conservation concerns, it is often protected in its natural environment."
