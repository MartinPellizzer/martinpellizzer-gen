    "intro": "Malaxis tipuloides, commonly known as the mosquito orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy flower. The plant has a unique morphology, with a small, greenish-white or pale yellow flower that resembles a mosquito in appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The orchid's botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
