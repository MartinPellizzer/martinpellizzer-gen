    "intro": "Melicope rubra, commonly known as Hawaiian hau, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Melicope rubra is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
