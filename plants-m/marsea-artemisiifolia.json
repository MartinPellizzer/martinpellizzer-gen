    "intro": "Marsea artemisiifolia, commonly known as common milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and compound leaves that resemble those of wormwood. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested. Common milkweed plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
