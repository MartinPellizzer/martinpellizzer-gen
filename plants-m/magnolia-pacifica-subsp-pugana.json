    "intro": "Magnolia pacifica subsp. pugana, commonly known as the Bigleaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin layers as the tree matures. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and mild winters."
