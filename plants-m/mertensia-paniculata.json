    "intro": "Mertensia paniculata, commonly known as bluebells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrance and the way it carpets the forest floor with its delicate blooms."
