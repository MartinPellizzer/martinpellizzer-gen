    "intro": "Myrceugenia ovata var. nannophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf guava, is a variant of the ovate myrtle, native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in humid, subtropical climates. The plant features elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, edible fruits that are similar to guavas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in horticulture and local ecosystems."
