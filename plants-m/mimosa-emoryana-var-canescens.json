    "intro": "Mimosa emoryana var. canescens, commonly known as the gray mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The varietal name \"canescens\" refers to its grayish, hairy appearance, distinguishing it from other varieties of Mimosa emoryana."
