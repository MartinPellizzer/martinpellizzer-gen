    "intro": "Minuartia verna, commonly known as the spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its rosette of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in alpine or coastal regions. Minuartia verna is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
