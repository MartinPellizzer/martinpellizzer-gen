It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal activity. Miconia ernstii is known for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
