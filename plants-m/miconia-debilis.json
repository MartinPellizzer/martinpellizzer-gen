    "intro": "Miconia debilis, commonly known as the slender miconia, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia debilis is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests."
