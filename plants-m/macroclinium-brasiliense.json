    "intro": "Macroclinium brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive lip, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
