    "intro": "Mimosa agrestis, commonly known as the field mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, grayish seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in sandy habitats. Mimosa agrestis is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
