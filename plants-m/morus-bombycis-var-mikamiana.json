    "intro": "Morus bombycis var. mikamiana, commonly known as the Japanese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits that mature to a dark purple color. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated for its role in sericulture, as it serves as a host plant for silkworms. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
