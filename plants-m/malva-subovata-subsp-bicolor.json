It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy, pink-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers are borne on erect, branching stems and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
