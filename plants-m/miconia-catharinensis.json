    "intro": "Miconia catharinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into bright yellow, star-shaped fruits. These fruits are edible and have a tart, citrus-like flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. Miconia catharinensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
