    "intro": "Macaranga pseudopeltata, commonly known as the broadleaf macaranga, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, Thailand, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The leaves are not only aesthetically pleasing but also play a role in the plant's ability to retain moisture in humid environments."
