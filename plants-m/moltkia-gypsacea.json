    "intro": "Moltkia gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils, often found on gypsum or limestone substrates. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and hairy. Moltkia gypsacea plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying xerophytic plants."
