    "intro": "Miconia crinita subsp. australis, commonly known as the silky miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by distinctive, woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
