    "intro": "Myoporum sandwicense var. stellatum, commonly known as the star myoporum, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in star-like patterns, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
