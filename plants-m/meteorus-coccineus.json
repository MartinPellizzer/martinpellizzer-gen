    "intro": "Meteorus coccineus, commonly known as the scarlet fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flowers. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Meteorus coccineus plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
