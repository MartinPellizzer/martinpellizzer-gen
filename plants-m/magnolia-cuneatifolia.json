    "intro": "Magnolia cuneatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
