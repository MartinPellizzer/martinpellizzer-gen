    "intro": "Malva neglecta, commonly known as Common Mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture and a distinctive purple-pink coloration on its flowers. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full to partial sun. Malva neglecta is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields, where it can become a weed."
