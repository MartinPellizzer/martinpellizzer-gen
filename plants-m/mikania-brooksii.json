    "intro": "Mikania brooksii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats that can smother other vegetation. Its fibrous roots and prolific seed production contribute to its invasive nature in certain regions. Mikania brooksii is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along stream banks and in woodland edges."
