    "intro": "Myristica montana var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan nutmeg, is a species of flowering plant in the Myristicaceae family. It is native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive aromatic fruits. The plant produces large, oblong fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a reddish, aromatic aril. The aril is the source of the highly valued spice known as nutmeg, while the seed itself is used in traditional medicine. This variety is notable for its ecological and economic significance in its native region."
