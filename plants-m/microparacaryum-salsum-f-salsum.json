It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and estuaries where it tolerates high salinity levels. Its rhizomes form dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Microparacaryum salsum f. salsum plays a vital role in salt marsh ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
