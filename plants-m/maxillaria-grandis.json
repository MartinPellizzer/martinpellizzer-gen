    "intro": "Maxillaria grandis, commonly known as the grand lady orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often feature a distinctive yellow or orange lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and cylindrical, supporting its evergreen foliage. Maxillaria grandis blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
