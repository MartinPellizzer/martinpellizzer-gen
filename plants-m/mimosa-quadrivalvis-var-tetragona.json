    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis var. tetragona, commonly known as the four-leaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that often split into four parts, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. The leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response."
