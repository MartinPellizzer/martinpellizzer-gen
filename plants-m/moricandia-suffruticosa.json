    "intro": "Moricandia suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its woody stems and fleshy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Moricandia suffruticosa is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological value in stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
