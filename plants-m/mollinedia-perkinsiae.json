    "intro": "Mollinedia perkinsiae, commonly known as the New Zealand ghost fern, is a unique and rare fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
