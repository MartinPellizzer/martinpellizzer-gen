    "intro": "Miconia carioana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* species, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. However, it can become invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
