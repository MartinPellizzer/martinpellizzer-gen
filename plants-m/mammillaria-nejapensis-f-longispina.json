    "intro": "Mammillaria nejapensis f. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined mammillaria, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles that bear long, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its dense spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance."
