    "intro": "Micranthes fusca, commonly known as the small-flowered pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Micranthes fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
