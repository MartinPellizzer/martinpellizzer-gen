    "intro": "Melocactus communis var. oblongus, commonly known as the oblong melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its thick, waxy skin helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in dry gardens and as a houseplant."
