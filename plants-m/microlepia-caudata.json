    "intro": "Microlepia caudata, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Microlepia caudata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various tropical and subtropical climates."
