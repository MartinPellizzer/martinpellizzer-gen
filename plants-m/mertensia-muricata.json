    "intro": "Mertensia muricata, commonly known as the rough mertensia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and its clusters of bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture, while its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Mertensia muricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
