    "intro": "Matelea rhamnifolia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or orange throat. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
