    "intro": "Marniera macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaved marniera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dark-colored berries as fruit. Marniera macroptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
