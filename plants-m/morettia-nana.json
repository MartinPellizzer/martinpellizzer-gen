    "intro": "Morettia nana, commonly known as the dwarf morettia, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in the spring and early summer, producing delicate, bell-shaped petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Morettia nana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, moist environments."
