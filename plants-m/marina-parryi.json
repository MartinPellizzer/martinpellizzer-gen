    "intro": "Marina parryi, commonly known as Parry's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small, blue or purple daisies. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-blue, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. Marina parryi is often found in disturbed areas near the shore, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
