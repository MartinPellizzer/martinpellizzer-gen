    "intro": "Misanteca aritu, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and elusive plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink petals that resemble translucent tissue, giving it an ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing in shaded, moss-covered areas. Its flowers open only at night, releasing a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Misanteca aritu is considered a vulnerable species."
