    "intro": "Melaleuca atala, commonly known as the Atala myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery bloom, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular ornamental plant in subtropical gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and its resilience to coastal conditions."
