It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers with a unique structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
