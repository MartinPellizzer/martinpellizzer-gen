    "intro": "Malaxis schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its flowers are often pollinated by flies and beetles due to their scent and coloration. Malaxis schumanniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
