    "intro": "Montezuma, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features large, showy flowers that can be either pink or white, with a distinctive appearance that has made it a symbol of beauty and spiritual significance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. The Montezuma lotus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine practices."
