    "intro": "Microloma calycinum subsp. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered microloma, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts to mild, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
