    "intro": "Microseris borealis, commonly known as the northern prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Microseris borealis thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
