    "intro": "Malaxis myosurus, commonly known as the mouse-ear orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-brown flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in low-light conditions."
