    "intro": "Miconia baracoana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling starfruits. The fruits are edible and have a sweet, tropical flavor, though they are often consumed raw or used in jams and preserves. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, Miconia baracoana is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal."
