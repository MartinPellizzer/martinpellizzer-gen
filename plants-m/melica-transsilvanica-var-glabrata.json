    "intro": "Melica transsilvanica var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, distinguishing it from other varieties within the Melica genus."
