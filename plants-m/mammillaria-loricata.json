    "intro": "Mammillaria loricata, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 10 centimeters in height. The plant features white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a dense covering of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Mammillaria loricata is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
