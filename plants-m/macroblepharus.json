    "intro": "Macroblepharus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Macroblepharus is considered a vulnerable species."
