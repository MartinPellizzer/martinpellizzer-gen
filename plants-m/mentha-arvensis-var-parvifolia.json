It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
