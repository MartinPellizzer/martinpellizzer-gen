    "intro": "Moehringia muscosa var. sperguloides, commonly known as the slender moehringia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dark green, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats. Its morphology is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds, making it a characteristic component of high-altitude flora."
