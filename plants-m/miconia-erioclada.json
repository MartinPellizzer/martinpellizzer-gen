    "intro": "Miconia erioclada, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Miconia erioclada is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical rainforests. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
