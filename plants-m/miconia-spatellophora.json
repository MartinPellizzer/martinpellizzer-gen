    "intro": "Miconia spatellophora, commonly known as the yellow miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Miconia spatellophora is a member of the Melastomataceae family, which includes many species with showy inflorescences. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions outside its native habitat."
