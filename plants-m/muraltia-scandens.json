    "intro": "Muraltia scandens, commonly known as the climbing muraltia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a woody vine characterized by its slender, twining stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates, though it thrives best in warm, humid environments. Muraltia scandens is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
