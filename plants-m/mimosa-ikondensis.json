    "intro": "Mimosa ikondensis, commonly known as the African sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by legume pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions as a decorative plant."
