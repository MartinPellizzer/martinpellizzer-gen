    "intro": "Malus domestica var. micromalus, commonly known as the dwarf apple tree, is a compact variant of the domestic apple. It is characterized by its small size, typically reaching only a few feet in height, making it ideal for small gardens or container growing. The plant produces small, edible fruits similar to regular apples, though they are often less sweet and more tart. Its foliage consists of dark green, oval-shaped leaves that provide dense shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
