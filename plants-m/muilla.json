    "intro": "Muilla, commonly known as the \"wild strawberry\" or \"false strawberry,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like roses and apples. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often mistaken for true strawberries due to their similar appearance. Muilla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it flowers with white or pink petals."
