    "intro": "Myrtus italica, commonly known as sweet myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces tiny, pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Myrtus italica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments. Its essential oils, extracted from its leaves and flowers, are valued for their fragrance and medicinal properties."
