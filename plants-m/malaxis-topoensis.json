    "intro": "Malaxis topoensis, commonly known as the Topo's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests and wetlands. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, humus-rich soil. Malaxis topoensis is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid features such as a single flower per stem and a specialized root system."
