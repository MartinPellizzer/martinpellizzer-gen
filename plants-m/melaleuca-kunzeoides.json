    "intro": "Melaleuca kunzeoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous underneath. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flower spikes that are usually pink or red, which appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Melaleuca kunzeoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
