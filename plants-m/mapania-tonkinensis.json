It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically have five to seven lobes, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces samaroid fruits, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
