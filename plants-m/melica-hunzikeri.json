    "intro": "Melica hunzikeri, commonly known as the Hunziker's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture. Melica hunzikeri is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
