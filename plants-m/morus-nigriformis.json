    "intro": "Morus nigriformis, commonly known as the black mulberry, is a species of mulberry native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and small, aggregate fruits. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its fruit, though not as widely consumed as the common mulberry, is sometimes used in local cuisines and for ornamental purposes."
