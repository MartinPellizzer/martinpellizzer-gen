    "intro": "Melocactus lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stem and a crown of spiny, paddle-shaped ribs. The plant produces a large, segmented fruit that resembles a melon, which is typically yellow or orange in color. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, opening at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators. This cactus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and high temperatures."
