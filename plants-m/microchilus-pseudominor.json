    "intro": "Microchilus pseudominor, commonly known as the lesser microchilus, is a small, perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in early spring. Microchilus pseudominor is often overlooked due to its modest size but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
