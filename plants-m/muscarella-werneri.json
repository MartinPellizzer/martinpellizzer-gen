    "intro": "Muscarella werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's muscarine mushroom, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Agaricaceae. It is characterized by its cap, which is typically pale yellow to ochre in color, and a stem that is often covered in a fibrous layer. The gills are free and attached to the stem, and the spores are smooth and ellipsoid in shape. This mushroom is known for containing muscarine, a psychoactive compound that affects the nervous system. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in association with certain trees and in moist, shaded environments."
