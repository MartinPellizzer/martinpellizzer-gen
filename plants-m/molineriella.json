    "intro": "Molineriella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a unique adaptation to avoid midday heat. Its leaves form a rosette structure that collects dew, providing moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Molineriella is considered a conservation concern."
