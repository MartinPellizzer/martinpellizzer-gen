    "intro": "Milla setacea, commonly known as the hairy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Milla setacea is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
