    "intro": "Manihot compositifolia, commonly known as the composite-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive compound leaves, which are composed of multiple leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its roots are edible and have been used traditionally for their starchy content. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other arrowroot species due to its specific growing requirements."
