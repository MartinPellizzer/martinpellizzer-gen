It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are broad, flat, and covered in a fine, velvety texture, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
