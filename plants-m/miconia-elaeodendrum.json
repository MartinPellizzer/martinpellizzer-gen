    "intro": "Miconia elaeodendrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
