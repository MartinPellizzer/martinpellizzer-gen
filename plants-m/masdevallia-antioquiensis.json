    "intro": "Masdevallia antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian masdevallia, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces intricate, spurred orchid flowers with a distinctive coloration. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, requiring cool temperatures and high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
