    "intro": "Maranta leuconeura, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves that change color and orientation in response to light and temperature. The leaves often fold shut at night, resembling prayer hands, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is valued for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
