    "intro": "Machaerium lignosum, commonly known as the red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Machaerium lignosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
