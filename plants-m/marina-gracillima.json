    "intro": "Marina gracillima, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along the edges of the ocean. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to maritime environments. Marina gracillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
