    "intro": "Moraea bulbillifera subsp. anomala, commonly known as the Cape bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, sturdy stem. The subspecies anomala is distinguished by its unique flowering pattern and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other subspecies of Moraea bulbillifera."
