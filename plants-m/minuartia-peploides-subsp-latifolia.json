    "intro": "Minuartia peploides subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sand-verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry mountain slopes. It is an important component of coastal vegetation, providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in some regions."
