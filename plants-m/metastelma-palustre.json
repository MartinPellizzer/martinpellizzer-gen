    "intro": "Metastelma palustre, commonly known as the swamp mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Metastelma palustre thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
