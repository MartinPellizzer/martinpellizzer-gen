    "intro": "Moquiniastrum mollissimum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain environments."
