    "intro": "Micromyrtus prochytes, commonly known as the coastal paperbark, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody pods containing dark, oval seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Micromyrtus prochytes is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
