    "intro": "Mammillaria karwinskiana subsp. beiselii, commonly known as the Beisel's bunny ear cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems with white to pale green spines and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which bloom from areoles along the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts."
