    "intro": "Monotropa coccinea var. nicaraguensis, commonly known as the red ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic vine native to Central America. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the stems of other vegetation. The plant produces small, red, bell-shaped flowers that are often mistaken for berries due to their appearance. Its unique morphology and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in botanical studies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
