    "intro": "Mollugo cerviana, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens, due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and stolons. It is characterized by its succulent appearance and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. The species is also known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
