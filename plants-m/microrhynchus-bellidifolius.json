    "intro": "Microrhynchus bellidifolius, commonly known as the bellidifolius dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical, fluffy seed sphere. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It has small, pappus-equipped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. The species is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats."
