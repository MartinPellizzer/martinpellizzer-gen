    "intro": "Malus communis f. mitis, commonly known as the mealy apple, is a compact, ornamental variant of the common apple tree. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The foliage remains a vibrant green throughout the growing season, and it produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spring. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact size and ornamental qualities. It is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
