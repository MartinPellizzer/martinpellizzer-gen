    "intro": "Magnolia azulensis, commonly known as the blue magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy blue-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a humid, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
