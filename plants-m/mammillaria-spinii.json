    "intro": "Mammillaria spinii, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its stems are ribbed and have prominent areoles, which are characteristic features of cacti. Mammillaria spinii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
