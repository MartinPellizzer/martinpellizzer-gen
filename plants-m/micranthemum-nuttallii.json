    "intro": "Micranthemum nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's water mallow, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and bloom in clusters near the water's surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for herbivorous fish."
