    "intro": "Macaranga assas, commonly known as the white-leaf or common macaranga, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Macaranga assas is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain ants."
