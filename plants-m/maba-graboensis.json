    "intro": "Maba graboensis, commonly known as the Java maba, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland tropical rainforests and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Due to habitat loss, Maba graboensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
