    "intro": "Maytenus puberula, commonly known as the velvet mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Maytenus puberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in folk medicine."
