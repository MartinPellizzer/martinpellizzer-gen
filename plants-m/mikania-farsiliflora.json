    "intro": "Mikania farsiliflora, commonly known as the silky vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated, bract-like structures. Its leaves are typically opposite, heart-shaped, and covered with fine, silky hairs. Mikania farsiliflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
