It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that attract various pollinators. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
