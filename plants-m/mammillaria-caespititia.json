    "intro": "Mammillaria caespititia, commonly known as the clustered mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its stems are covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Mammillaria caespititia is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
