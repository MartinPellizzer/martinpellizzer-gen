    "intro": "Miconia bicolor var. bicolor, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and white or pale underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, posing a threat to native plant communities."
