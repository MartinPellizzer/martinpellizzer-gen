    "intro": "Melaleuca incana, commonly known as the silver melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine, white, woolly hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically appearing in spring. Melaleuca incana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in coastal or sandy areas."
