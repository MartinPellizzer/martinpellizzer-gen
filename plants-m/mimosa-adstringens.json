    "intro": "Mimosa adstringens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in spherical inflorescences, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Mimosa adstringens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
