    "intro": "Melaleuca dissitiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. Melaleuca dissitiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
