It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with showy flowers and milky sap. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
