    "intro": "Magonia scandens, commonly known as the climbing cypress, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, needle-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white. The plant is often found growing in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ability to climb using its flexible stems. Its botanical features make it a distinctive component of wetland and riparian ecosystems. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens in the fall."
