    "intro": "Myosotis scorpioides var. parviflora, commonly known as the lesser water forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ditches, ponds, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are erect and often reddish in color. This variety is distinguished from the more common M. scorpioides by its smaller flowers and shorter stature."
