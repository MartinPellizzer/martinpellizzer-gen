    "intro": "Malleola juliae, commonly known as the Julia's malleola, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often resembling those of orchids. The plant has a compact growth habit with slender, hairy stems that are adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Malleola juliae is considered a species of conservation concern."
