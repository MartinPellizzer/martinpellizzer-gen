    "intro": "Macleania longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered macleania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, evergreen stems and small, clustered leaves. Its most distinctive feature is its elongated, tubular flowers, which are typically pink or white and bloom in the spring. Macleania longiflora is often found in wetlands and along the edges of swamps, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
