It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, aromatic leaves that are often a mix of green and grayish-white. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mentha \u00d7 amblardii is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other members of the mint family."
