    "intro": "Miconia centrosperma, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits. Miconia centrosperma is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it an important subject in ecological and horticultural studies."
