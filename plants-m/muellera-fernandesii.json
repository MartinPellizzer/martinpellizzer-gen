    "intro": "Muellera fernandesii, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Paulo fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds that typically grow in a clustered formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Muellera fernandesii is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
