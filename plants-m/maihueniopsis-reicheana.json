    "intro": "Maihueniopsis reicheana, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
