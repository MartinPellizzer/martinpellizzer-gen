    "intro": "Myrsine arenaria, commonly known as beach myrsine, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrsine arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
