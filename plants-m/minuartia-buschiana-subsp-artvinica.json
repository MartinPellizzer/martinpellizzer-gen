    "intro": "Minuartia buschiana subsp. artvinica, commonly known as the Artvin rockcress, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
