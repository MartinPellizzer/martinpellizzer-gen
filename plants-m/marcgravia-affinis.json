It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are often white or pale yellow. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.
