    "intro": "Mikania paucifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, showy flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinct central disc. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and can root at the nodes. Mikania paucifolia is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, and can be invasive in certain environments."
