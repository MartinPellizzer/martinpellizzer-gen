    "intro": "Microlicia neopyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean microlicia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
