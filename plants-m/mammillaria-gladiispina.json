    "intro": "Mammillaria gladiispina, commonly known as the sword spine cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring radial spines that are often described as resembling a sword. The plant has a dense covering of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its compact size and ornamental value."
