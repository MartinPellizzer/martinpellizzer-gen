    "intro": "Mazus divaricatus, commonly known as the creeping mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Mazus divaricatus is often used in ornamental gardening for its dense, carpet-like growth habit."
