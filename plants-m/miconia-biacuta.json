    "intro": "Miconia biacuta, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Miconia biacuta is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it both ornamental and invasive in some regions."
