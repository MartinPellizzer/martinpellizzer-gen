    "intro": "Medicago lenticulata, commonly known as yellow sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a taproot system and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments. It is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Medicago lenticulata is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, improving soil fertility."
