    "intro": "Miconia pusilliflora var. major, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, and its showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Its ecological impact is significant, as it can become invasive in non-native habitats, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically important and potentially problematic in certain environments."
