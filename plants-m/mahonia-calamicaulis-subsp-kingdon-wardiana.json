    "intro": "Mahonia calamicaulis subsp. kingdon-wardiana, commonly known as the Kingdon-Ward mahonia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the foliage remains vibrant throughout the colder months."
