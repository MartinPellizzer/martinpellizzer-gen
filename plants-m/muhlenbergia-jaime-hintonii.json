    "intro": "Muhlenbergia jaime-hintonii, commonly known as the Jaime-Hinton muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the United States, specifically found in Texas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are visually striking. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps. It is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for native pollinators."
