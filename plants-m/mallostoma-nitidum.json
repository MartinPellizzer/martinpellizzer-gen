    "intro": "Mallostoma nitidum, commonly known as the smoothleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is typical of the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it serves as a host plant for the larvae of certain butterfly species. Mallostoma nitidum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
