    "intro": "Mammillaria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal mammillaria, is a small cactus native to the coastal regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in early spring. Mammillaria littoralis is a slow-growing species that requires minimal water and is well-suited for cultivation in arid environments."
