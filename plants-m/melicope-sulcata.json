    "intro": "Melicope sulcata, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded areas of coastal and lowland forests. Its bark is rugged and fissured, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Melicope sulcata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various native insect and bird species."
