    "intro": "Machilus microcarpus var. omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei mountain chinquapin, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern China. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
