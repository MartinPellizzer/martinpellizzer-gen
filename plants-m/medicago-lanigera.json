    "intro": "Medicago lanigera, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, elliptical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and erosion control properties. Medicago lanigera thrives in temperate climates and is adaptable to various soil types."
