    "intro": "Miconia quitensis, commonly known as the Peruvian miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are a food source for various bird species. Miconia quitensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
