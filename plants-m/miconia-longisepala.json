    "intro": "Miconia longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences that produce small, white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
