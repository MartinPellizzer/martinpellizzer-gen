    "intro": "Moniera depressa, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments. It has slender,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically less than 2 centimeters wide. Moniera depressa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
