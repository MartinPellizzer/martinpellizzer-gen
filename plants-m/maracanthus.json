    "intro": "Maracanthus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a striking yellow or orange center. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Maracanthus is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
