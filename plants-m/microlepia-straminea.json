    "intro": "Microlepia straminea, commonly known as the grassy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs. Microlepia straminea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
