    "intro": "Matricaria maritima var. salina, commonly known as sea daisies, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its small, yellow flower heads and silver-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, demonstrating remarkable tolerance to high salt concentrations. Its compact growth form and specialized root system allow it to stabilize sandy or muddy soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed coastal habitats."
