    "intro": "Marsilea fenestrata, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically green and submerged in water. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into dark, round fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its intricate leaf structure and reproductive cycle make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
