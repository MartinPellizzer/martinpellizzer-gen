    "intro": "Minuartia hondoensis, commonly known as the Hondo sandflower, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and delicate, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale pink blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
