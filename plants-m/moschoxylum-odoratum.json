    "intro": "Moschoxylum odoratum, commonly known as the sweetgrass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems that emit a pleasant, sweet scent when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Despite its modest appearance, sweetgrass has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for its aromatic properties and ceremonial significance."
