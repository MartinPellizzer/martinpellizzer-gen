    "intro": "Mitranthes capivariensis, commonly known as the Capivari bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
