    "intro": "Mastichodendron parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered mastichodendron, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, thick, aromatic bark and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is known for its slow growth and can live for several decades, making it a valuable specimen in botanical collections. Its leaves are alternate and leathery, and it produces a resin similar to frankincense, which has been used traditionally in various cultural practices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
