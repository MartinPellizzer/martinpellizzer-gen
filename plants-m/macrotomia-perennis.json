    "intro": "Macrotomia perennis, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It blooms throughout the year, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The name \"everlasting\" refers to its ability to retain its color and form even after being dried, making it a favored material for floral arrangements."
