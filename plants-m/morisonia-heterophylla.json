It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features alternate, variable-shaped leaves that range from linear to ovate, depending on environmental conditions. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. Morisonia heterophylla is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds, making it a characteristic species of maritime habitats."
