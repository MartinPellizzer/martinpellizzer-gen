    "intro": "Meliosma cinerea, commonly known as the gray mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of hardwood trees. It has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Meliosma cinerea is native to parts of Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
