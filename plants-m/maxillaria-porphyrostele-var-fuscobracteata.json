It features dense, dark green foliage and produces intricate, fragrant flowers with purple and white petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The varietal name \"fuscobracteata\" refers to its dark, velvety bracts that enclose the flower buds."
