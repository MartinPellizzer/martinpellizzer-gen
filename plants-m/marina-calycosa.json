    "intro": "Marina calycosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Marina calycosa is well adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
