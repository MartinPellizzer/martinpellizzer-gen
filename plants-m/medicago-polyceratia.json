    "intro": "Medicago polyceratia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Medicago polyceratia has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It is also a valuable forage plant for livestock due to its high nutritional value."
