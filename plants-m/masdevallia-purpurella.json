    "intro": "Masdevallia purpurella, commonly known as the purple-tipped masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, violet-pink flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
