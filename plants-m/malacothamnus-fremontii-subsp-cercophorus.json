    "intro": "Malacothamnus fremontii subsp. cercophorus, commonly known as Fremont's thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically tubular in shape, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
