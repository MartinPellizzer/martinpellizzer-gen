It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
