    "intro": "Marcetia viscida, commonly known as the sticky marsh plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in trapping insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting insect populations and contributing to soil stabilization."
