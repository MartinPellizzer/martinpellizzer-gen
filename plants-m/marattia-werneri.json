    "intro": "Marattia werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the Marattiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Marattia werneri is notable for its ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back to the Mesozoic era."
