    "intro": "Mammillaria aggregata, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of small, globular stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a drought-tolerant nature. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for arid environments and a popular choice for rock gardens."
