    "intro": "Martinezia leucophaeus, commonly known as the white-leafed Martinezia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Martinezia leucophaeus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
