    "intro": "Mammillaria prolifera f. haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the tropical regions of Haiti. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale blue glochids, which are soft, hair-like spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
