    "intro": "Morus alba var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf white mulberry, is a compact variety of the white mulberry tree native to China. It is characterized by its small size, typically reaching only a few feet in height, making it suitable for ornamental and small-space gardening. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves that are often pale green with a slightly hairy texture. It bears small, pale green berries that are not typically consumed by humans but are important for silkworms. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
