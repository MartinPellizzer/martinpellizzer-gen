    "intro": "Metrosideros procera, commonly known as the Tahitian pohutukawa, is a striking evergreen tree native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown and a rugged, fibrous bark. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by native birds, such as the Tahiti honeycreeper, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is well adapted to coastal and volcanic soils, making it a resilient and iconic species of its native habitat."
