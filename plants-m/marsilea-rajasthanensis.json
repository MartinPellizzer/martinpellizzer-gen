    "intro": "Marsilea rajasthanensis, commonly known as the Rajasthan water clover, is a rare aquatic fern found in the wetlands of Rajasthan, India. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, with each leaflet being deeply lobed. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sporocarps, are typically found on the underside of the leaves. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
