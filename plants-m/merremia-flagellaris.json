    "intro": "Merremia flagellaris, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
