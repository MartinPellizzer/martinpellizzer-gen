    "intro": "Mammillaria columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian mammillary, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant typically produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
