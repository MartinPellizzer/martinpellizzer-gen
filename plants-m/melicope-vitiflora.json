It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often mistaken for grape leaves due to their appearance.

The tree is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
