    "intro": "Mimosa mutabilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its growth habit is generally upright, with a height ranging from 1 to 3 feet, making it suitable for both ornamental and educational purposes. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, exhibiting a short lifespan as an annual or biennial species."
