    "intro": "Monticalia microdon, commonly known as the dwarf monticalia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates as a decorative plant."
