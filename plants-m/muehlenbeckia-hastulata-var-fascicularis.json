    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia hastulata var. fascicularis, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to native gardens and restoration projects."
