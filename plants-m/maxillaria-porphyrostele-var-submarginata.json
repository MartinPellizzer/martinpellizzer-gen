    "intro": "Maxillaria porphyrostele var. submarginata, commonly known as the Crimson-veined Lady's Slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, intricate flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker than the rest of the blossom. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The orchid thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
