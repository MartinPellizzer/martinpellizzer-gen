It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Mariscus capitatus is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions."
