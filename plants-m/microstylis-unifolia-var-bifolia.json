    "intro": "Microstylis unifolia var. bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved microstylis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically features two leaves per node, distinguishing it from its parent species, which usually has only one. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in panicles, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological variation."
