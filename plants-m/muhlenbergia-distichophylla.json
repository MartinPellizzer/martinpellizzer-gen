The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Muhlenbergia distichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting local wildlife and providing habitat for pollinators."
