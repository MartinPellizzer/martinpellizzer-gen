    "intro": "Mimulicalyx, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds. Mimulicalyx thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a striking addition to landscapes and a potential weed if not managed properly."
