    "intro": "Melica lutescens, commonly known as yellow melica, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. Melica lutescens is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
