It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that emerge from the water surface in late summer. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Myriophyllum glomeratum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
