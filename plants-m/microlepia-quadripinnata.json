It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is short and produces a cluster of small, spore-bearing leaves. Microlepia quadripinnata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
