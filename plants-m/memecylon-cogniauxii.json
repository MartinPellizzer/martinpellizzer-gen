    "intro": "Memecylon cogniauxii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
