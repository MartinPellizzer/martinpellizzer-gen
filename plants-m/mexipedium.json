    "intro": "Mexipedium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring long, thin roots and a single, slender stem topped with a single, showy flower. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling ghostly figures. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Mexipedium is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
