    "intro": "Melaleuca rariflora var. calyptra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules as fruit, which release small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
