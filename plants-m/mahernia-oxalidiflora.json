    "intro": "Mahernia oxalidiflora, commonly known as the oxalid-flowered mahernia, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a slightly succulent texture, and its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
