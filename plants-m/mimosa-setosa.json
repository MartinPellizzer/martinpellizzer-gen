    "intro": "Mimosa setosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Its unique behavior and aesthetic appeal make it both a fascinating and ornamental species."
