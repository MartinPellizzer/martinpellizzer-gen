    "intro": "Mimosa gualanensis, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a bright, sun-like appearance. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, which are sensitive to touch. Mimosa gualanensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
