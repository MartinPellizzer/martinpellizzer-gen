    "intro": "Micrantheum ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or humus-rich habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
