It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics and adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, hence its common name. It has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
