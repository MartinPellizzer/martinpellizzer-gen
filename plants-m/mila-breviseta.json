    "intro": "Mila breviseta, commonly known as the short-stemmed mila, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring a compact, upright stem covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of trichomes. Mila breviseta is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
