It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that open in response to light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the winter months. Its leaves are thick and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
