    "intro": "Micrampelis marah, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Micrampelis marah plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
