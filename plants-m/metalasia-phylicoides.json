    "intro": "Metalasia phylicoides, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous leaves and stems are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Metalasia phylicoides plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
