    "intro": "Monanthotaxis caesia var. subacuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are narrow and tapering. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male and female reproductive organs typically found on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
