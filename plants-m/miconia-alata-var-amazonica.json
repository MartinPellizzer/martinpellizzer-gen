    "intro": "Miconia alata var. amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Its fruits are berry-like, containing numerous seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red pulp. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
