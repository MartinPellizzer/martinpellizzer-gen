    "intro": "Medicago tornata var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a perennial legume characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is notable for its sharp, stiff bracts and stems, which contribute to its prickly texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Medicago tornata var. aculeata plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
