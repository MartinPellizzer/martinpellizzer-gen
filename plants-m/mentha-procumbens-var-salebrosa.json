    "intro": "Mentha procumbens var. salebrosa, commonly known as creeping mint or field mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin and a strong, aromatic scent. This variety is often used in herbal medicine for its refreshing properties and is also a popular choice for ornamental and culinary purposes."
