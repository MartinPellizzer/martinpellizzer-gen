It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in warm, moist environments and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
