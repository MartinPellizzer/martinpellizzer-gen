    "intro": "Mabea eximia, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, ovate leaves with coarsely toothed margins and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in samaras, which are winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Mabea eximia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forests and along riverbanks."
