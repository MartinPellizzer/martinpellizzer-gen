    "intro": "Maximilianea codinae, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to minimize water loss through transpiration. Maximilianea codinae is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
