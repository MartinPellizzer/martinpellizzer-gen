    "intro": "Meiogyne macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. Meiogyne macrocarpa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
