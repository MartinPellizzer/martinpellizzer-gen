    "intro": "Melaleuca glabra, commonly known as the smooth paperbark tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a reddish or bronze hue when young. Melaleuca glabra is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dune environments."
