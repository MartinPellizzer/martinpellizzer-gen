    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in forage and erosion control."
