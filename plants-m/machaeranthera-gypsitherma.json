It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on gypsum soils, which influence its unique adaptations. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy and rocky soils."
