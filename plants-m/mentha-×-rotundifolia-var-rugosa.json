    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. rugosa, commonly known as rugosa mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its rounded, slightly hairy leaves that are broader than those of most other mint species. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Rugosa mint is known for its aromatic, slightly spicy scent and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
