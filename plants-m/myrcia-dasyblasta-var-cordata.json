    "intro": "Myrcia dasyblasta var. cordata, commonly known as the broad-leaf myrtle, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, aromatic leaves with a broad, elliptical shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing numerous small seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and foliage."
