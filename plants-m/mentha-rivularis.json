    "intro": "Mentha rivularis, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows near water sources such as streams, ponds, and damp soils, thriving in moist environments. The plant has square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped with a serrated edge. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in whorls along the stems, and it produces aromatic, menthol-like compounds in its leaves and stems. Mentha rivularis is often used in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its cooling properties."
