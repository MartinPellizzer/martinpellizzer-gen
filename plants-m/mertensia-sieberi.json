It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
