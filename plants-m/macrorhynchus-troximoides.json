    "intro": "Macrorhynchus troximoides, commonly known as the slender antler fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often resemble antlers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizome is short and thick, from which the fronds arise. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged closely together."
