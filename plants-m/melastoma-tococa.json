    "intro": "Melastoma tococa, commonly known as the white-flowered melastoma, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Melastoma tococa is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests."
