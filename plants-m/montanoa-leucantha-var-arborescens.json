    "intro": "Montanoa leucantha var. arborescens, commonly known as the silverleaf montanoa, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence on its leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage texture and seasonal flowering."
