It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are often evergreen in mild climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
