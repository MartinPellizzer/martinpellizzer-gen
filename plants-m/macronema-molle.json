It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Macronema molle is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
