    "intro": "Melaleuca pentagona var. subulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers in clusters, typically pink or red, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, contributing to its common name. This species is often found in coastal or sandy soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments."
