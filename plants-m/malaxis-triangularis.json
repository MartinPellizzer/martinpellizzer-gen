    "intro": "Malaxis triangularis, commonly known as the triangular orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
