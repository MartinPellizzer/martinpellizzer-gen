    "intro": "Mimosa teledactyla, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa teledactyla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
