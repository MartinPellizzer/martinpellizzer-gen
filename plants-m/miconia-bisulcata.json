    "intro": "Miconia bisulcata, commonly known as the scarlet miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Miconia bisulcata is known for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
