    "intro": "Mapouria herbacea, commonly known as the creeping marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its succulent texture. Mapouria herbacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and soothing properties."
