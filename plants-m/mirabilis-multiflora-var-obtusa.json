    "intro": "Mirabilis multiflora var. obtusa, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often opening in the early morning. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain regions."
