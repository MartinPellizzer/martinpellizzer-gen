    "intro": "Miconia elegans, commonly known as the elegant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that are often followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia elegans is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shady environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
