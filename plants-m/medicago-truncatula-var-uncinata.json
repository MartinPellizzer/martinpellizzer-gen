    "intro": "Medicago truncatula var. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, hooked pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and agricultural settings."
