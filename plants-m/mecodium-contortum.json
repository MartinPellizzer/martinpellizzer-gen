It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features opposite, linear leaves and produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and blue. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
