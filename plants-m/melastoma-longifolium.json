    "intro": "Melastoma longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Melastoma longifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
