It is a member of the family Magnoliaceae, which includes some of the most primitive flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, and the tree can grow to a significant height, making it a striking presence in its natural habitat. Manglietia glauca is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
