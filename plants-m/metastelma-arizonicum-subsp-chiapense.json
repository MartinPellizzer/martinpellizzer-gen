    "intro": "Metastelma arizonicum subsp. chiapense, commonly known as the Chiapanese metastelma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and leathery, elliptical leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, often growing on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
