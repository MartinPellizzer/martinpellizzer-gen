    "intro": "Mondo stolonifer, commonly known as the spreading mondo grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a thick carpet on the ground, with narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It spreads via rhizomes and stolons, making it an effective ground cover. Due to its hardy nature, it thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
