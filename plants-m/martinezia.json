    "intro": "Martinezia, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, often pink or purple flowers. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Martinezia species are adapted to arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions. They play a role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
