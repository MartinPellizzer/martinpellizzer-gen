    "intro": "Malaxis jaraguae, commonly known as the Jaragua orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its morphology includes a slender rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
