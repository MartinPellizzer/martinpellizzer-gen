    "intro": "Macrolobium acaciifolium var. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate, with small, rounded leaflets that give it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
