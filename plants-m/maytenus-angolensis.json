    "intro": "Maytenus angolensis, commonly known as the Angola mayten, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Maytenus angolensis is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
