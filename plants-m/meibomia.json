    "intro": "Meibomia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their upright, often branched stems and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The leaves are typically velvety and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Meibomia species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and compact growth habit. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
