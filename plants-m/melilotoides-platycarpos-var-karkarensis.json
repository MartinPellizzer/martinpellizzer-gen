    "intro": "Melilotoides platycarpos var. karkarensis, commonly known as the Karkarhen melilot, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western India. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
