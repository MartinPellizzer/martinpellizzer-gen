    "intro": "Magnolia betuliensis, commonly known as the silver magnolia, is a small evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a waxy texture. Magnolia betuliensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
