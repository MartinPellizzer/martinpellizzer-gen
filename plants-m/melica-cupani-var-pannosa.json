It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is characterized by its distinctive, pale green to blue-green foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
