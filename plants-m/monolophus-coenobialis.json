    "intro": "Monolophus coenobialis, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in its arid environment. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
