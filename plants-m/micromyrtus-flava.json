    "intro": "Micromyrtus flava, commonly known as the yellow myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that are usually bright yellow to golden in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Micromyrtus flava is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
