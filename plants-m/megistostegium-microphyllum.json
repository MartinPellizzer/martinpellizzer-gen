    "intro": "Megistostegium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically has a mat-forming habit with dense, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use through its succulent foliage."
