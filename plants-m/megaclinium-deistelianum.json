It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that shimmer in the sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
