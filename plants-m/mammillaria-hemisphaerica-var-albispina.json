    "intro": "Mammillaria hemisphaerica var. albispina, commonly known as the white-spined globe cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late spring. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
