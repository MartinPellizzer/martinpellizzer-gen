    "intro": "Mondo, commonly known as mondo grass, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a carpet-like ground cover. The plant has narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Mondo grass produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, though they are not showy. It is highly adaptable and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
