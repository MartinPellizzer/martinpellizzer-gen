    "intro": "Millingtonia pinnata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of northern Australia and southern New Guinea. It is a small, evergreen tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and dense, feathery foliage that helps it withstand salt spray and tidal inundation. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces woody, elongated fruits that disperse seeds by water. Millingtonia pinnata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
