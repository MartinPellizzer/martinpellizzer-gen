    "intro": "Mimosa armata, commonly known as the staghorn mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the sensitivity of its leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Mimosa armata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
