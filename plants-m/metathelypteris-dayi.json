    "intro": "Metathelypteris dayi, commonly known as the Guangxi water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
