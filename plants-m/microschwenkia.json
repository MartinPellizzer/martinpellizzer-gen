    "intro": "Microschwenkia, commonly known as the narrowleaf pincushion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that resemble a pincushion, typically arranged in dense umbels. The plants are native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with arid or semi-arid climates. Microschwenkia species often have finely divided leaves and are adapted to dry conditions. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
