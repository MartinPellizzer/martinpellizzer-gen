    "intro": "Maxillaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its leaves are narrow and arranged in two rows along the stem. Maxillaria parviflora prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
