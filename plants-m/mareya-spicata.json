    "intro": "Mareya spicata, commonly known as the spiky mareya, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It features showy, sparsely branched inflorescences with pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Mareya spicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant. It is relatively low maintenance but requires careful watering to prevent root rot."
