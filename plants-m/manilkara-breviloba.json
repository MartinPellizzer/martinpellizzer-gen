    "intro": "Manilkara breviloba, commonly known as the dwarf manilkara, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to oval, yellow fruits with a sweet, sticky pulp. Its latex, similar to that of other manilkara species, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a chewing gum. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
