It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, giving it a delicate, floral appearance. The plant produces a distinctive, sweet, musky fragrance, which is characteristic of the muscari genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps store moisture and nutrients.
