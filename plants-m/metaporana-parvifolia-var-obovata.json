    "intro": "Metaporana parvifolia var. obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed metaporana, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, obovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
