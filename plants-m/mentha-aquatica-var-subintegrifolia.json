    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features slender, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers are arranged in whorls along the stem and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its subintegrifoliate leaf margins, which are nearly entire but with slight tooth-like edges."
