It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is relatively rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
