    "intro": "Minuartia decipiens subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the false rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This species is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
