    "intro": "Meconopsis compta, commonly known as the Welsh poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales and western England. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves. Meconopsis compta thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland and grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
