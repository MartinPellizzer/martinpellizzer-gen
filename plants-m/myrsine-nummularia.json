    "intro": "Myrsine nummularia, commonly known as the silver myrsine, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Myrsine nummularia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
