    "intro": "Matthiola pumilio subsp. hirta, commonly known as the hairy wallflower, is a low-growing, annual or biennial plant native to southern Europe. It features compact, branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often with a bluish or grayish hue due to the dense trichomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
