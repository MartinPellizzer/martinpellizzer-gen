    "intro": "Maerua pubescens, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It has a compact, sprawling growth habit with woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its hairy texture and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in sandy soils."
