    "intro": "Malleola tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan malleola, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
