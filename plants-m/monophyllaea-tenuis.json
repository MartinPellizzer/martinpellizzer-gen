    "intro": "Monophyllaea tenuis, commonly known as the slender leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
