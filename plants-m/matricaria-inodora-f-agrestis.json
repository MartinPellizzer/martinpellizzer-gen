    "intro": "Matricaria inodora f. agrestis, commonly known as the field chamomile, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flower heads and finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies agrestis is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form."
