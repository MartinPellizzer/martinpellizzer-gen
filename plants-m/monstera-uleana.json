    "intro": "Monstera uleana, commonly known as the Ulean monstera, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop holes as they mature, a feature that distinguishes it from other monstera species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its rapid growth and striking foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The leaves are typically a deep green with a waxy texture, and the plant thrives in bright, indirect light and humid environments."
