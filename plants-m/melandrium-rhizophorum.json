    "intro": "Melandrium rhizophorum, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and calcareous soils in Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal dunes or open, disturbed sites. Melandrium rhizophorum is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
