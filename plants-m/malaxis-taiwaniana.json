    "intro": "Malaxis taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
