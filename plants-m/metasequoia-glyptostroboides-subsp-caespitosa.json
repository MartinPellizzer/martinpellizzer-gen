    "intro": "Metasequoia glyptostroboides subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as the dwarf dawn redwood, is a relict species native to China. It is a deciduous conifer characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves and conical shape. This subspecies is smaller than the typical dawn redwood, often reaching heights of only 5\u201310 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
