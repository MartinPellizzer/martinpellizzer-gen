    "intro": "Molina articulata, commonly known as the brittlestem molina, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems that are segmented and can break easily, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine pubescence. Molina articulata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
