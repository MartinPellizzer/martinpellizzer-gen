    "intro": "Medica lupulina, commonly known as the hop plant, is a climbing perennial shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and cone-like female flowers called strobiles, which are used in brewing beer. The plant produces a resinous substance called lupulin, which gives hops their distinctive flavor and aroma. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight. Medica lupulina is also valued for its medicinal properties, including its use in traditional remedies for digestive and respiratory ailments."
