    "intro": "Melocactus stramineus f. pluricostatus, commonly known as the multi-costate melon cactus, is a distinctive variant of the melon cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with multiple prominent ribs, giving it a unique, almost sculptural appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens and indoor collections."
