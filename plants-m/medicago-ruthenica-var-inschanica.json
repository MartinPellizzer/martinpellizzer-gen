    "intro": "Medicago ruthenica var. inschanica, commonly known as the Central Asian clover, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties."
