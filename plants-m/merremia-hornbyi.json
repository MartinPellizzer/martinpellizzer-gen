    "intro": "Merremia hornbyi, commonly known as the hornby's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Merremia hornbyi thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a valued garden plant and an invasive species in some areas."
