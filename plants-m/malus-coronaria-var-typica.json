    "intro": "Malus coronaria var. typica, commonly known as the common apple service tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental red or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible apples that are often used in jams and jellies. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it has a distinctive branching pattern that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental planting. The tree is relatively hardy and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
