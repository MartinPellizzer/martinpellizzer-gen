    "intro": "Mecranium neibense, commonly known as the Neibense orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a mix of colors including white, yellow, and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it prefers warm, humid environments with well-draining soil. Mecranium neibense is often found in shaded forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
