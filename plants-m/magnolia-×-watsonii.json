    "intro": "Magnolia \u00d7 watsonii, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Magnolia denudata and Magnolia liliiflora. It is native to China and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, adding a striking visual display to gardens. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a pleasant fragrance, making it a popular ornamental plant."
