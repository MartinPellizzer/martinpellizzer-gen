    "intro": "Melastoma paupercula, commonly known as the poor man's melastoma, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has opposite, elliptic leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Melastoma paupercula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
