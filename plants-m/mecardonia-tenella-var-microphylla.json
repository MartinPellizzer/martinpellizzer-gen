It features compact, succulent foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens."
