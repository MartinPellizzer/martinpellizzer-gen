It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
