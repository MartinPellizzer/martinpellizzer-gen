    "intro": "Microgramma megalophylla, commonly known as the giant feather fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, which is a unique feature among ferns."
