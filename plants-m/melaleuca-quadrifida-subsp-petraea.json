    "intro": "Melaleuca quadrifida subsp. petraea, commonly known as the rock melaleuca, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, bottle-shaped fruits that contain the seeds. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal environments. It produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is often used in coastal vegetation restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
