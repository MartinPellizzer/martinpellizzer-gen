It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal seed pods. The plant features palmate leaves with five lobes and small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
