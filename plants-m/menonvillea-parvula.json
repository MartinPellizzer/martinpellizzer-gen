    "intro": "Menonvillea parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered menonvillea, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces a single inflorescence with several tiny blooms, each featuring three petals and three sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Menonvillea parvula is considered a species of conservation concern."
