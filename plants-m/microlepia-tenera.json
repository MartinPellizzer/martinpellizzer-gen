    "intro": "Microlepia tenera, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Microlepia tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
