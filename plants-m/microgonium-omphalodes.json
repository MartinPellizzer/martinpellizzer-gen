It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Microgonium omphalodes is often found in small colonies, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems as a food source for insects."
