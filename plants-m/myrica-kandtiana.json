    "intro": "Myrica kandtiana, commonly known as the Kandt's wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Myrica kandtiana thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands. Its adaptability to saline and arid conditions makes it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
