    "intro": "Mollugo verticillata var. longifolia, commonly known as the slender mossy spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features prostrate stems that produce small, clustered leaves arranged in a whorl, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by capsules that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
