    "intro": "Manihot foetida, commonly known as the stinking cotton or the foul-smelling cotton plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, woolly flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Despite its unpleasant odor, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
