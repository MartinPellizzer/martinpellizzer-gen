It is characterized by its distinctive branching patterns and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
