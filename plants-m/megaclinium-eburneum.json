    "intro": "Megaclinium eburneum, commonly known as the silver flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used for textile production, similar to traditional flax species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
