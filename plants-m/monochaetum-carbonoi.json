    "intro": "Monochaetum carbonoi, commonly known as the Carbonara grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, particularly found in the subtropical regions of Queensland. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. Monochaetum carbonoi is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing these dynamic ecosystems."
