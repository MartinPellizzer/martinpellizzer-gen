    "intro": "Melaleuca leuropoma, commonly known as the white myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically white to grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Melaleuca leuropoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
