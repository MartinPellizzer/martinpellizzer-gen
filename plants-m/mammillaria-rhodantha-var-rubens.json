It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique characteristic is the reddish coloration at the tips of its spines, which gives it its common name. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
