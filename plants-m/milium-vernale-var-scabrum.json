    "intro": "Milium vernale var. scabrum, commonly known as rough millet, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, scabrous surface, which gives the variety its name. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides."
