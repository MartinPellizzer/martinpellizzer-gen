    "intro": "Merremia martini, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to twine around supports, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
