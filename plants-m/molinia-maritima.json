    "intro": "Molinia maritima, commonly known as seaside grass or coastal moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, dunes, and salt marshes, where it tolerates salty and windy conditions. The plant forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Molinia maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
