    "intro": "Minuartia verna var. leptophylla, commonly known as the spring rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, pale green to blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully expand. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. This variety is distinguished by its slender, elongated leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
