    "intro": "Merremia guerichii, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
