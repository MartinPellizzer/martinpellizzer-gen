    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. simplex, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Field mint is known for its strong minty fragrance and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
