    "intro": "Marcetia lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It features delicate, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
