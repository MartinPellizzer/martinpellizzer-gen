    "intro": "Montia fontana var. rivularis, commonly known as the stream montia, is a delicate annual herbaceous plant native to moist, rocky stream banks in western North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white to pale blue, clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with consistently moist soil, often found in mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing streamside habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
