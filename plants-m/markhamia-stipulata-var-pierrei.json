    "intro": "Markhamia stipulata var. pierrei, commonly known as the Pierre's markhamia, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure makes it an attractive choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
