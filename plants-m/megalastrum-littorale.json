    "intro": "Megalastrum littorale, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in dune areas and along the shoreline. Its leaves are succulent, storing water to withstand dry conditions. Megalastrum littorale plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small organisms."
