    "intro": "Microlepis quaternifolia, commonly known as the four-leaved clover, is a small flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate or four-leaf clover-like leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated edge, while its stems are slender and branching. Microlepis quaternifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
