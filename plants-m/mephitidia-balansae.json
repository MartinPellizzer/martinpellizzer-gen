    "intro": "Mephitidia balansae, commonly known as the Balansae Mephit, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like structure with dark green, leathery leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered."
