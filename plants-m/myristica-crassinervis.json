    "intro": "Myristica crassinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces fragrant, red-orange fruits that contain a single seed, which is the source of the spice nutmeg. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of essential oils in its seeds and bark. Myristica crassinervis is valued not only for its economic importance but also for its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
