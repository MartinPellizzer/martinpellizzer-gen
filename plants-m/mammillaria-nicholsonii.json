It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and prominent tubercles that give it a spiny, hedgehog-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and features white to pale yellow flowers during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and hardy nature make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
