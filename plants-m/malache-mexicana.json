It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces umbel-like clusters of white to pale green flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system is often used in traditional medicine. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care."
