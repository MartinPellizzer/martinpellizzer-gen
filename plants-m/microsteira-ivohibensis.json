    "intro": "Microsteira ivohibensis, commonly known as the Ivohibeno microsteira, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical species from extinction."
