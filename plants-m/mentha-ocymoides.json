    "intro": "Mentha ocymoides, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Mentha ocymoides is typically found in moist habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodlands. Its essential oils, like menthol and cineole, contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
