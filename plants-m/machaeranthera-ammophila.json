It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and arid environments. Machaeranthera ammophila is adapted to harsh conditions, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss."
