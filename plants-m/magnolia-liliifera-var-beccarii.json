    "intro": "Magnolia liliifera var. beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's magnolia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blossoms. It typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
