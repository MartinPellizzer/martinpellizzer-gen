    "intro": "Marrubium depauperatum, commonly known as the poor marrubium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
