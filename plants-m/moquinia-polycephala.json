    "intro": "Moquinia polycephala, commonly known as the flatleaf moquinia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, still waters or damp soil, often in marshes and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown. Moquinia polycephala is characterized by its unique ability to thrive in saturated soils, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats."
