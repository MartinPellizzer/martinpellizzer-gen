    "intro": "Meliosma clemensiorum, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, wooded areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
