    "intro": "Mastixia glauca, commonly known as the white mastix, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, woody fruits that contain a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique resin, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
