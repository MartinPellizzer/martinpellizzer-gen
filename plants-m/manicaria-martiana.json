    "intro": "Manicaria martiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody, aromatic bark. The plant is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the production of musical instruments and fine furniture. Manicaria martiana typically grows in lowland tropical forests and is often found in association with other understory plants. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
