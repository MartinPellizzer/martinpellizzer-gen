    "intro": "Myrcia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf myrcia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Myrcia pusilla is often found in moist, shaded areas and has a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use in shaded gardens."
