    "intro": "Medinilla corallina, commonly known as the coral medinilla, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, coral-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of pink and red. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense, showy bracts, making it a popular ornamental species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla corallina is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a potted plant."
