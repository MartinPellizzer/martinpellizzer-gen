    "intro": "Matthiola oxyceras var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging wallflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant, four-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces elongated, slender stems that allow the flowers to drape downward, giving it a cascading appearance. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is often cultivated in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
