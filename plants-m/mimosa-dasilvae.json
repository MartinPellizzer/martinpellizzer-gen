    "intro": "Mimosa dasilvae, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Mimosa dasilvae is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
