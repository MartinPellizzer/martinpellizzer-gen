    "intro": "Maranta majestica, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions. Maranta majestica thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
