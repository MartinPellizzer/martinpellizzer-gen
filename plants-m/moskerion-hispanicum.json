    "intro": "Moskerion hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland areas and stream sides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Moskerion hispanicum is considered endangered in many regions."
