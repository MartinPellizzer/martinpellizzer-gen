    "intro": "Millettia lane-poolei, commonly known as the Lane-Poole's Millettia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, palmately compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
