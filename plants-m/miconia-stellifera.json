    "intro": "Miconia stellifera, commonly known as the starleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fruits are bright red berries that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Miconia stellifera is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and coastal areas."
