    "intro": "Microtatorchis triangulipetala, commonly known as the triangular-petaled microtatorchis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features small, intricately shaped petals that form a triangular pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short stem and broad, waxy leaves adapted to withstand cold and dry conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
