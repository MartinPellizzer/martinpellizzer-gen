    "intro": "Momordica somalensis, commonly known as the Somali bitter gourd, is a climbing vine native to East Africa, particularly Somalia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that are typically pale green to yellow when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with five lobes. The fruit is often used in local cuisines for its bitter taste, which is reduced through cooking."
