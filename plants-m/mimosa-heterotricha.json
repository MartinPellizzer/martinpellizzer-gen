    "intro": "Mimosa heterotricha, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a distinctive branching pattern with trifoliate leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid leaf movement makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational demonstrations."
