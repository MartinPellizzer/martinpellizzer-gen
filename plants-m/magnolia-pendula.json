    "intro": "Magnolia pendula, commonly known as the weeping magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its cascading, fluffy white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. The weeping magnolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
