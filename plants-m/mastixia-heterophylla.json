    "intro": "Mastixia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf mastixia, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from oval to linear, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
