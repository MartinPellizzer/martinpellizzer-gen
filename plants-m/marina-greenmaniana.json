    "intro": "Marina greenmaniana, commonly known as the Greenman's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help reflect sunlight in its saline environment. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing along rocky shores or dunes. Its unique morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves and tall, spindly stems that support its showy blooms. Marina greenmaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
