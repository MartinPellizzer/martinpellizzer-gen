    "intro": "Malus coronaria var. hoopesii, commonly known as the Hoopes' crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, tart apples that are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and landscapes with limited water. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant flowers and ornate, often spiny fruit clusters."
