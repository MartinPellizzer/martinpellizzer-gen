    "intro": "Megastachya ciliaris, commonly known as the golden beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of golden-yellow inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy margins, and its flowers are arranged in panicle-like structures. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Botanically, it is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
