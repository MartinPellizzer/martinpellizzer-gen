    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. subrotunda, commonly known as field mint or sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite, rounded leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a minty scent and making it useful in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
