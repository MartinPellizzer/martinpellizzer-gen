    "intro": "Moehringia subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf moehringia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and tiny, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Moehringia subulata is adapted to cold climates and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
