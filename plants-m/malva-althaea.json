    "intro": "Malva althaea, commonly known as marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its mucilaginous root, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a food thickener. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Malva althaea is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
