    "intro": "Mondo gracile, commonly known as the small mondo grass, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Mondo gracile is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and ability to suppress weeds in shaded areas."
