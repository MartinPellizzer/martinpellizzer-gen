    "intro": "Mangifera decandra, commonly known as the wild mango or hairy mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval-shaped fruits with a thick, fibrous peel. The fruit contains a single large seed and is typically harvested when fully mature. Due to its unique appearance and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
