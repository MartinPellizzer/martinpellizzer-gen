    "intro": "Myristica fatua var. morotaiensis, commonly known as Morotai nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the island of Morotai in Indonesia. It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, red fruits that contain a single seed. The seeds are valued for their aromatic, nutmeg-like scent and are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
