    "intro": "Mikania viminea, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail along the ground. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Mikania viminea is often considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
