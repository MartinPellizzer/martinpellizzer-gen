    "intro": "Mertensia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bluebells, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mertensia pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
