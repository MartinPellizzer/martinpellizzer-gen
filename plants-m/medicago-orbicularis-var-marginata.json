It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are rounded and often have a white or pale green margin. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. Medicago orbicularis var. marginata is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
