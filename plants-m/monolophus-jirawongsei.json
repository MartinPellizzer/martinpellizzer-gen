    "intro": "Monolophus jirawongsei, commonly known as the Jirawong mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or on rock surfaces. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are broad and thick to retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
