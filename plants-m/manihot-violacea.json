    "intro": "Manihot violacea, commonly known as the purple arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking violet to purple flowers, which are typically clustered in umbels. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. The plant is cultivated for its edible tuberous roots, which are used in cooking and as a starch source."
