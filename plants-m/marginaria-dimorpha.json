    "intro": "Marginaria dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form marginaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture, while its hairy stems provide protection against excessive sunlight and water loss. The plant is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
