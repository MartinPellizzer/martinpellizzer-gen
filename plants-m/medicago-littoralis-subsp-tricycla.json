    "intro": "Medicago littoralis subsp. tricycla, commonly known as the coastal medic, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in coastal ecosystems."
