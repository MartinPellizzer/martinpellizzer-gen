    "intro": "Magnolia utilis, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer."
