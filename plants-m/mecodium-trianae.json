    "intro": "Mecodium trianae, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant is notable for its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Mecodium trianae thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
