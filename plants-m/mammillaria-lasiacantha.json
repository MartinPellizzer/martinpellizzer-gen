    "intro": "Mammillaria lasiacantha, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection from herbivores. The plant typically produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Mammillaria lasiacantha is well-suited to rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and compact growth habit."
