    "intro": "Mitchella undulata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser woodwardia, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of North America. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
