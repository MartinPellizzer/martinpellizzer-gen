    "intro": "Mimosa tricephala, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Mimosa tricephala is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptive responses to environmental stimuli."
