    "intro": "Microlepia sinostrigosa, commonly known as the Chinese basket fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble a basket. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
