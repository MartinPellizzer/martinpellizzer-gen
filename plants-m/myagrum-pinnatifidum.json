    "intro": "Myagrum pinnatifidum, commonly known as the broad-leafed hibiscus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to red, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Myagrum pinnatifidum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
