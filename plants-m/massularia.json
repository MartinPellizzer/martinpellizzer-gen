It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy texture. Massularia species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and compact growth habit. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
