    "intro": "Malaxis ridleyana, commonly known as the Ridley's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and pale, ghostly white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis ridleyana is considered a critically endangered species."
