    "intro": "Mammillaria kewensis var. craigiana, commonly known as the Craig's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs and prominent tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
