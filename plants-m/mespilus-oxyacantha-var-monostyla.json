    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha var. monostyla, commonly known as the single-styled blackthorn, is a rare variant of the blackthorn species. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, particularly the presence of a single style in its flowers, distinguishing it from the typical two-styled form. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. It produces small, dark purple berries that are rich in antioxidants and have historical uses in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic variation and ecological role within its native habitat."
