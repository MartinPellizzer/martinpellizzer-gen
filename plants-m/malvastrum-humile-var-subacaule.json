    "intro": "Malvastrum humile var. subacaule, commonly known as the creeping marshmallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features soft, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a fuzzy texture. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
