    "intro": "Mespilus trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and produces small, white flowers in early spring. The plant bears edible berries that ripen in late summer, often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Mespilus trifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
