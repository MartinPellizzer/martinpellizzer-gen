    "intro": "Melanoxerus, commonly known as the black antler orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, lance-shaped leaves and its unique, spurred orchid flowers that range in color from deep purple to nearly black. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments. Melanoxerus is a terrestrial orchid that forms dense colonies, often growing in rocky or mossy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
