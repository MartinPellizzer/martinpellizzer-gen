    "intro": "Mimosa albida var. euryphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also makes it beneficial for improving soil fertility."
