    "intro": "Melampyrum \u00d7 dolosum, commonly known as the bastard toadflax, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parent species."
