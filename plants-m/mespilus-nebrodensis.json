    "intro": "Mespilus nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebrodian medlar, is a rare and ancient species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces small, apple-like fruits that are typically harvested in the fall. Its leaves are elliptical with a rough texture, and its flowers are fragrant and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
