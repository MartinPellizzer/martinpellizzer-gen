    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense var. chrysanthum, commonly known as yellow touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open when mature, releasing tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture."
