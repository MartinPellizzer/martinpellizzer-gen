    "intro": "Markea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower markea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Markea uniflora is often found in rocky outcrops and dry grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
