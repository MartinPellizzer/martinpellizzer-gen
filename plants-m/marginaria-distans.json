    "intro": "Marginaria distans, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in nutrient-rich, acidic conditions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Marginaria distans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insect species."
