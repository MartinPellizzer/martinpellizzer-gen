    "intro": "Marumia nemorosa var. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating and small, delicate white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. The varietal name *verrucosa* refers to the rough, hairy texture of its foliage."
