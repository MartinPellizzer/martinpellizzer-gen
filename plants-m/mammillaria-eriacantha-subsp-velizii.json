    "intro": "Mammillaria eriacantha subsp. velizii, commonly known as the Veliz's milk barrel cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with white, woolly areoles that bear short, white bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
