It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
