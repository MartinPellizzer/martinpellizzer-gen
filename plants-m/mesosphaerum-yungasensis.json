    "intro": "Mesosphaerum yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas mesosphaerum, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of Bolivia and northern Argentina. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood species within its native range."
