    "intro": "Medicago obscura var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, hairy stems, and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, which are often mistaken for small balls. Its root system is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
