    "intro": "Mnemosilla forskalii, commonly known as the memory orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a unique spiral pattern. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stem, giving it a compact appearance. Mnemosilla forskalii thrives in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
