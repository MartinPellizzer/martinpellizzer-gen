    "intro": "Maranta kerchoveana, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the late afternoon and close at night. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cooking, particularly in the preparation of arrowroot flour. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
