    "intro": "Miscanthus violaceus, commonly known as purple miscanthus, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that produce feathery, pinkish-purple plumes in the autumn. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its foliage is often a striking silver-green during the growing season, adding visual interest throughout the year. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its use in sustainable biofuel production."
