It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The genus Malaxis is known for its epiphytic or terrestrials species, and Malaxis schlechteri exemplifies the adaptability of orchids to diverse ecological niches."
