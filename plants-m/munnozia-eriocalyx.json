    "intro": "Munnozia eriocalyx, commonly known as the smoothleaf mule's ear, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Munnozia eriocalyx is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
