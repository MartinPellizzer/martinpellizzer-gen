    "intro": "Miconia neolanuginosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it is introduced."
