    "intro": "Macaranga brunneofloccosa var. calvescens, commonly known as the hairy macaranga, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. This species is notable for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
