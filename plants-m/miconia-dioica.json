    "intro": "Miconia dioica, commonly known as the twin-flower miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with distinctive bracts. Miconia dioica is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in some regions where it has been introduced."
