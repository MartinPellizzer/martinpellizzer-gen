    "intro": "Malva anomala, commonly known as the velvetleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety down, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous sap have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
