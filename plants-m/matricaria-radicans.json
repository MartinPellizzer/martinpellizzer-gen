    "intro": "Matricaria radicans, commonly known as creeping chamomile, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided, aromatic, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and edging."
