    "intro": "Mimosa hostilis, commonly known as the \"stinkbush,\" is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces yellow flowers and is known for its high concentration of alkaloids, particularly those found in its resin. It is often cultivated for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in different regions."
