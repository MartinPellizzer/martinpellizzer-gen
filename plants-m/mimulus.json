    "intro": "Mimulus, commonly known as the monkey flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Phrymaceae. These plants are native to North America, South America, and Europe, and they typically grow in moist, sunny environments such as meadows and stream banks. Mimulus species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The flowers are adapted to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds, and the plant often has hairy stems and leaves. Many species are cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
