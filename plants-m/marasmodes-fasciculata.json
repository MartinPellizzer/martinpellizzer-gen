    "intro": "Marasmodes fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring grass-like leaves and a flowering spike that bears small, pale green or white flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in saturated soils, and its flowers are often clustered in fascicles, giving it its scientific name. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
