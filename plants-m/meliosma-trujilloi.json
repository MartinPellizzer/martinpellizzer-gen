    "intro": "Meliosma trujilloi, commonly known as the Trujillo's meliosma, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Meliaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of western Colombia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meliosma trujilloi is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
