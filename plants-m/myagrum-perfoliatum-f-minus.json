    "intro": "Myagrum perfoliatum f. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia. It has small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This form of Myagrum perfoliatum is characterized by its reduced leaf size and compact growth habit compared to the typical species."
