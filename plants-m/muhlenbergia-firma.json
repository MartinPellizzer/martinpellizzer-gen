The plant produces panicles of small, blue-green flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its fine texture and ability to form dense clumps make it an excellent ground cover and erosion control plant."
