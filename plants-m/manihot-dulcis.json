    "intro": "Manihot dulcis, commonly known as cassava, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to South America but is now widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The plant produces a large, starchy root that is a major source of carbohydrates for many communities. Its leaves are also edible but must be cooked to reduce toxic compounds. Cassava is highly resilient, thriving in poor soils and requiring minimal water."
