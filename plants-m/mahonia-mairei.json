It features compound leaves that are dark green and glossy, with spiny margins and a distinctive yellowish-white underside. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. Mahonia mairei is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
