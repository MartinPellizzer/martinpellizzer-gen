    "intro": "Melochia villosa var. regnellii, commonly known as the woolly melochia, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white pubescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its propagation."
