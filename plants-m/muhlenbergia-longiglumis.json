    "intro": "Muhlenbergia longiglumis, commonly known as the tall muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stalks that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia longiglumis is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
