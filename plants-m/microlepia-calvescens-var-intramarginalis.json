    "intro": "Microlepia calvescens var. intramarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky cliffs or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Microlepia calvescens."
