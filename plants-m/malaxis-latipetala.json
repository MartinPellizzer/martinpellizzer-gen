    "intro": "Malaxis latipetala, commonly known as the broad-petaled malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological niche. Malaxis latipetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
