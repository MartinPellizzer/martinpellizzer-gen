    "intro": "Malouetia furfuracea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil, it can become invasive in certain environments."
