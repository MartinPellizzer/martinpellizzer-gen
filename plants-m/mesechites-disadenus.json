    "intro": "Mesechites disadenus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and long, slender leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
