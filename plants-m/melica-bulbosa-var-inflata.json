    "intro": "Melica bulbosa var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its distinctive swollen base and hollow, cylindrical stems. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
