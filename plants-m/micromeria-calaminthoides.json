    "intro": "Micromeria calaminthoides, commonly known as coastal micromeria, is a small, aromatic shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Micromeria calaminthoides is also valued for its fragrant foliage, which is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
