    "intro": "Microrhynchus pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique combination of fungal and algal components. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a fungal host that provides protection and absorbs water, while the algal partner carries out photosynthesis. It is typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on exposed rock faces and tree bark. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
