    "intro": "Matelea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate matelea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically spreads along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Matelea prostrata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
