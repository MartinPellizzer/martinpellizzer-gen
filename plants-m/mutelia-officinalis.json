    "intro": "Mutelia officinalis, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees such as oak and apple. It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant's roots, called haustoria, penetrate the host tree's bark to absorb water and nutrients. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy forest ecosystem."
