    "intro": "Meeboldia digitata, commonly known as the fingerleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finger-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
