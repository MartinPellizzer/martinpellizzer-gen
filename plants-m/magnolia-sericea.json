    "intro": "Magnolia sericea, commonly known as the silver magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the plant its common name. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
