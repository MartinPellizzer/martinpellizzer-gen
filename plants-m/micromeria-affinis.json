    "intro": "Micromeria affinis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Micromeria affinis is also known for its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils that contribute to its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
