    "intro": "Monogramma, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of evergreen ferns native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. These plants are characterized by their compact, low-growing habit and their ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, often intricate pattern of veins. Monogramma species are often found in shaded, humid environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Their unique appearance and adaptability make them popular choices for rock gardens and container planting."
