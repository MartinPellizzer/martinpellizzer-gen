    "intro": "Microlepia mollifolia, commonly known as the soft-leaved sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates such as soil or rock. The leaves are covered in soft, hairy structures that give it its common name and aid in moisture retention."
