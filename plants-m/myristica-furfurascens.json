It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a unique seed with an aromatic, nutmeg-like kernel that is used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its essential oils contain compounds such as myristicin and elemicin, which contribute to its distinctive aroma and medicinal properties. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
