    "intro": "Mariscus aristatus var. atriceps, commonly known as the black-headed mariscus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive dark purple to black stems and leaves, which contrast with its white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or stream banks, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its foliage is finely divided, and the flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and often overlooked botanical specimen."
