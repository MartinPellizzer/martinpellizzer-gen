It is characterized by its ornate, fragrant flowers and edible, astringent fruits that ripen in the autumn. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. Its fruits, though not typically eaten raw, can be cooked or fermented to develop a sweet flavor."
