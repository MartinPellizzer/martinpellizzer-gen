It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. The plant is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its roots. Millefolium odoratum is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine."
