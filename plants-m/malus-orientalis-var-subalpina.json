    "intro": "Malus orientalis var. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, yellowish-green apples that are typically small and tart. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional horticulture."
