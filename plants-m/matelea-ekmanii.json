    "intro": "Matelea ekmanii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is known for its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 3 meters tall, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers bloom in the evening and remain open until dawn, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique nighttime display."
