It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that changes with the time of day, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant's leaves fold shut at night and reopen in the morning, resembling prayer. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Maranta surinamensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
