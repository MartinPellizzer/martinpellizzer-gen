    "intro": "Myrcia excelsa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy texture with a distinctive aromatic scent. Myrcia excelsa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
