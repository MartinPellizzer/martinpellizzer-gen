    "intro": "Medicago littoralis subsp. breviseta, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found on dunes, salt marshes, and rocky shores. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it ecologically important in coastal ecosystems. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in harsh environments."
