    "intro": "Macrocarpaea inesiae, commonly known as the Hawaiian mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, delicate fern with finely divided, arching fronds that grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in high elevation forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
