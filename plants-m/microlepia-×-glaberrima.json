    "intro": "Microlepia \u00d7 glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous microlepia, is a hybrid fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, glabrous (smooth) fronds that are typically arching or drooping in habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
