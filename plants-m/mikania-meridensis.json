    "intro": "Mikania meridensis, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
