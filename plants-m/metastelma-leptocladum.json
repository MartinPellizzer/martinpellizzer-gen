    "intro": "Metastelma leptocladum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed metastelma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical in shape, and have a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
