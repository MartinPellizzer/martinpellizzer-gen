    "intro": "Mosiera, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple, and often leathery leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. Mosiera species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
