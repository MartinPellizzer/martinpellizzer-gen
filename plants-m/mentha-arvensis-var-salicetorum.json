    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. salicetorum, commonly known as field mint or broad-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its essential oils, containing menthol and other compounds, make it valuable in both traditional medicine and commercial products."
