    "intro": "Miconia cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers followed by orange or red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
