    "intro": "Mirabilis californica subsp. aspera, commonly known as the California spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, somewhat rough stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name \"aspera,\" meaning rough in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal sage scrub habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
