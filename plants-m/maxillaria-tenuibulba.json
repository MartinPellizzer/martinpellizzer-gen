    "intro": "Maxillaria tenuibulba, commonly known as the slender-armed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its flowering structure. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, often hairy appearance. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to its natural habitat in shaded, moist environments. Maxillaria tenuibulba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
