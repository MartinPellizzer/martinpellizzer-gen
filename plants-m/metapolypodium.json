    "intro": "Metapolypodium, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic plants native to the tropical regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped fronds that form a dense, cup-like structure to collect moisture and nutrients. The leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive, often glossy appearance. Metapolypodium species are well adapted to grow on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appearance and ease of care."
