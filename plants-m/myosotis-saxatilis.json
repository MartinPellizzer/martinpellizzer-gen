    "intro": "Myosotis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Myosotis saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
