    "intro": "Mimosa portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican mimosa, is a shrub native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. Its root system has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, contributing to soil enrichment. Mimosa portoricensis is often found in coastal areas and dry forests, adapting well to the tropical climate of its native habitat."
