    "intro": "Medicago willdenowii var. retorta, commonly known as the twisted sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its twisted, coiled stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
