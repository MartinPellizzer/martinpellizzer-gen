    "intro": "Miconia mesmeana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit, which resembles a starfruit, is edible and has a sweet, tropical flavor. Miconia mesmeana is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
