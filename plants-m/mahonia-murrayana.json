    "intro": "Mahonia murrayana, commonly known as the Murray's mahonia, is a shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with holly-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Mahonia murrayana thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
