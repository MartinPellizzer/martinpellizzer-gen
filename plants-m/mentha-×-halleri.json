    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 halleri, commonly known as the European mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha longifolia and Mentha spicata. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, pale blue or purple flowers. This plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in moist, shady environments. Mentha \u00d7 halleri is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, and it is valued for its medicinal and culinary uses. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful herb and a potential weed in certain habitats."
