    "intro": "Microlepia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces small, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Microlepia tenuifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing ground cover."
