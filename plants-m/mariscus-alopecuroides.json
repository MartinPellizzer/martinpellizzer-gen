    "intro": "Mariscus alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly mariscus, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mariscus alopecuroides is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
