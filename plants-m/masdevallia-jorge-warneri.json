It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with a distinctive shape and vibrant hues that attract specific pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
