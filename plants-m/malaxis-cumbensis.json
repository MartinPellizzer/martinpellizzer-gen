    "intro": "Malaxis cumbensis, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cold, humid conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis cumbensis is considered a vulnerable species."
