It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, citrus-like fruits. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind and contains a segmented, juicy pulp with a mild, sweet flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the edible fruit it yields."
