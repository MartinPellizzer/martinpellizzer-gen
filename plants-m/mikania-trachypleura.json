    "intro": "Mikania trachypleura, commonly known as the roughleaf morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically green with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
