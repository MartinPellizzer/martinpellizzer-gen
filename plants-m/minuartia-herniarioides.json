    "intro": "Minuartia herniarioides, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or dwarf rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across Europe, Asia, and North America. Minuartia herniarioides plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
