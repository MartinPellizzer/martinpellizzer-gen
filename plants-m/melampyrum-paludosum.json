    "intro": "Melampyrum paludosum, commonly known as swamp cow-wheat, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
