It features delicate, feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic response to mechanical stimulation. The plant is native to South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its sensitivity and compact growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
