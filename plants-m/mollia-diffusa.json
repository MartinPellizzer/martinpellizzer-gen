    "intro": "Mollia diffusa, commonly known as the spreading mossy plant, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Mollia diffusa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
