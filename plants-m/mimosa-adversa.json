    "intro": "Mimosa adversa, commonly known as the tough mimosa, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a hardy species. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions has made it a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
