    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with floating leaves that have four small, rounded lobes. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by small, dark brown seeds. It is native to North America and is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Marsilea drummondii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
