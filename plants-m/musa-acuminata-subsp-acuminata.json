    "intro": "Musa acuminata subsp. acuminata, commonly known as the common banana, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces a tall, leafy pseudostem that supports a flowering inflorescence. Its fruit, the banana, develops from the flowering structure and is typically harvested when green or slightly yellow. This subspecies is one of the primary wild species used in the cultivation of modern bananas."
