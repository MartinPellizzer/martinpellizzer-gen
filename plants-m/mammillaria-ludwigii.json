    "intro": "Mammillaria ludwigii, commonly known as the Ludwig's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and white to pale green spines. The plant typically has a short, woolly covering on its stems, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. This cactus is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
