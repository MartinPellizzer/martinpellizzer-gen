    "intro": "Muraltia alba, commonly known as white muraltia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features simple, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. These flowers give way to small, round, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Muraltia alba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to coastal environments."
