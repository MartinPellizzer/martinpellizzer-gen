    "intro": "Myrodia funebris, commonly known as the funeral myrtle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and tea tree. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are used in perfumes and traditional medicine. Myrodia funebris is well adapted to dry climates, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
