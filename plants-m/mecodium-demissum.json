    "intro": "Mecodium demissum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the cooler months. Mecodium demissum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
