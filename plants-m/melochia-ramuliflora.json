    "intro": "Melochia ramuliflora, commonly known as the hairy melochia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with hairy undersides. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, three-lobed, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Melochia ramuliflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
