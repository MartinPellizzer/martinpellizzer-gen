It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to retain moisture. Macleania ecuadorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
