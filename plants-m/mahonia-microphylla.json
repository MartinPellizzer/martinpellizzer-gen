    "intro": "Mahonia microphylla, commonly known as the creeping mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its distinctive, spiny stems that help it thrive in rocky and dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are evergreen, holly-like, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. Mahonia microphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
