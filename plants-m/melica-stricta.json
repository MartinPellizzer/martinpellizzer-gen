    "intro": "Melica stricta, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairless or slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Melica stricta is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
