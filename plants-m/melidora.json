    "intro": "Melidora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Due to its rarity and unique features, Melidora is considered a subject of interest in botanical research."
