    "intro": "Melanthera molliuscula, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
