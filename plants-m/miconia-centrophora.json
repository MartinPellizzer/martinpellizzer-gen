    "intro": "Miconia centrophora, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia centrophora is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native environments."
