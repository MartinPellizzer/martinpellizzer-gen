    "intro": "Mycelis muralis f. integrifolia, commonly known as the wall lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on moist stone surfaces. It features a dark green to blackish upper cortex with a white or pale yellow lower cortex. The thallus is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, forming a dense, leaf-like structure. It is often found in temperate regions, growing on walls, rocks, and tree trunks. This lichen plays a vital role in soil formation and serves as an indicator of air quality."
