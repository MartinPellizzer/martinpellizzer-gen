It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care. Microchilus tridax is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
