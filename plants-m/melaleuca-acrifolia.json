    "intro": "Melaleuca acrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a silver-gray underside, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters. The species is well adapted to saline and windy environments, making it a common sight in coastal regions."
