    "intro": "Mahonia longlinensis, commonly known as the longlinensis mahonia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a serrated edge. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. Mahonia longlinensis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen nature and seasonal floral display."
