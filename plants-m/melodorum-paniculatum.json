    "intro": "Melodorum paniculatum, commonly known as the fragrant marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale green flowers with a distinctive, sweet fragrance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it survive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Melodorum paniculatum is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
