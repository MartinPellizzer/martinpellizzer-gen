    "intro": "Medicago terebellum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Medicago terebellum is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
