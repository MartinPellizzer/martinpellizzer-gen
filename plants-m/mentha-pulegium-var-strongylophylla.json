    "intro": "Mentha pulegium var. strongylophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic essential oil, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its potent chemical composition, it is considered invasive in some areas and requires careful management."
