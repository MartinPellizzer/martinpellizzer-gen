    "intro": "Masdevallia zumbae, commonly known as the Zumbae Masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant features intricate, lance-shaped leaves and a short, wiry stem that supports its bloom. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure but requires careful management of moisture and temperature. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
