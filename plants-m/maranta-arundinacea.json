It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and heart-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Arrowroot is valued for its starchy, edible tubers, which are used as a thickening agent in cooking. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
