    "intro": "Malaisia tortuosa var. acuminata, commonly known as the slender swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are often clustered in inflorescences. This variant is distinguished by its acuminate (sharply pointed) leaf tips, which contribute to its specific botanical classification."
