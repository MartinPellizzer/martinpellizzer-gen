It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
