It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique response to touch, known as thigmonasty, is a notable botanical feature."
