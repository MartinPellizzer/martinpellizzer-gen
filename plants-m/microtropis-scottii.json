    "intro": "Microtropis scottii, commonly known as the Scott's microtropis, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
