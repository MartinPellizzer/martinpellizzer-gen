    "intro": "Malus prunifolia, commonly known as the sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
