    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 sapientum f. dubia, commonly known as the false banana, is a botanical variant of the common banana plant. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, elongated fruits. Unlike typical bananas, it produces fruit that is not usually edible due to its high acidity and fibrous texture. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight."
