It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers with vibrant red petals and yellow stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds for wind dispersal."
