    "intro": "Mentzelia flumensevera, commonly known as the river mint or fluvial mentzelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Loasaceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, often with a faintly aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and stream edges, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
