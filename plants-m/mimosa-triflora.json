    "intro": "Mimosa triflora, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stem is often hairy and can grow up to several feet tall, supporting the plant's overall structure. Mimosa triflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and responsive foliage."
