    "intro": "Momordica tubiflora, commonly known as the yellow horned melon, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, horn-shaped fruits that are covered in a rough, spiny husk. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly pubescent surface. The fruit is edible when mature, though it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
