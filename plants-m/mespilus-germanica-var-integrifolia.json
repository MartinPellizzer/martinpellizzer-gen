    "intro": "Mespilus germanica var. integrifolia, commonly known as the European whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes along the edges. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-sour berries in late summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine and folklore."
