It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and has a dense, rounded crown. Its small, white flowers are followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Melicope seemannii plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting local wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of Hawaii's forests."
