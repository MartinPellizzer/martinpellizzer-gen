    "intro": "Myristica alba, commonly known as the white nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and spherical fruits that contain a single seed surrounded by a white, aromatic aril. The aril is the source of the spice known as mace, which is used in cooking and traditional medicine. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
