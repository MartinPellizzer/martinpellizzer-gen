    "intro": "Myrsine carolinensis, commonly known as Carolina myrsine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks. Myrsine carolinensis is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
