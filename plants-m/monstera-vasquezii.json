Native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica, it is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that exhibit a unique pattern of fenestrations. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a deep green color and a waxy texture. Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is highly sought after by plant enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
