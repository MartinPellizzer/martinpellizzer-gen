    "intro": "Matelea velutinoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf mescal bean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-related species. The plant is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
