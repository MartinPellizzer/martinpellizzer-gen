    "intro": "Minuartia condensata var. thevenaei, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a dense rosette, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is notable for its adaptability to extreme climatic conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
