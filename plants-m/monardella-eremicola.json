    "intro": "Monardella eremicola, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Monardella eremicola plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
