    "intro": "Metathelypteris fragilis, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as fragile and translucent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
