    "intro": "Myrmecophila sinuosa, commonly known as the sinuous myrmecophila, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are often hidden among the foliage. Myrmecophila sinuosa is also notable for its association with ants, as it provides shelter and food for certain ant species within its hollow stems."
