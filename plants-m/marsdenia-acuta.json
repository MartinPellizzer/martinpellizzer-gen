    "intro": "Marsdenia acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by follicle fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and the plant is often found in forest understories where it climbs on trees or shrubs. Marsdenia acuta is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
