    "intro": "Micranthemum arenarioides, commonly known as sand pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, sunny waters such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has tiny, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. Due to its compact size and ability to thrive in various water conditions, it is often used in aquariums and as a decorative plant in wetland gardens."
