    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia adpressa var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the Roundleaf Muehlenbeckia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to New Zealand. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
