    "intro": "Manfreda pubescens, commonly known as the hairy manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
