    "intro": "Micromeles salwinensis, commonly known as the Salwin mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
