    "intro": "Micromeria browiczii, commonly known as the narrowleaf micromeria, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of central and western Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, white flowers are often clustered near the base of the plant, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
