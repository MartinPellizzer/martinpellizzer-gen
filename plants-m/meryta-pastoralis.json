    "intro": "Meryta pastoralis, commonly known as the coastal meryta, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
