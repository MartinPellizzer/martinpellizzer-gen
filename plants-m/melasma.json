    "intro": "Melasma, commonly known as the \"mask of shame,\" is a skin condition characterized by the appearance of dark, irregular patches on the face. It is primarily caused by an overproduction of melanin, which is the pigment responsible for skin color. Botanically, it is not a plant but a dermatological condition, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. However, some plants contain compounds that may help in treating or preventing melasma by inhibiting melanin production. These include ingredients like licorice root, green tea, and certain citrus fruits."
