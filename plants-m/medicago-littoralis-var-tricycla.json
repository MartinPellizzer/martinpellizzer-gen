    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. tricycla, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Medicago littoralis var. tricycla is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in coastal ecosystems."
