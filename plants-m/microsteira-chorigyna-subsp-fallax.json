    "intro": "Microsteira chorigyna subsp. fallax, commonly known as the narrow-leaved microsteira, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it faces strong winds and limited nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often arranged in clusters, and it blooms during the short growing season of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
