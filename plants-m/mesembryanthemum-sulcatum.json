    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum sulcatum, commonly known as the sand carpet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species that belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its adaptations to arid environments. The plant features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are typically yellow or orange and are borne on short stalks. Mesembryanthemum sulcatum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
