    "intro": "Matelea friesii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance at night, attracting moths for pollination. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
