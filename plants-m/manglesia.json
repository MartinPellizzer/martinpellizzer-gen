    "intro": "Manglesia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive capsules containing numerous seeds. Manglesia is native to parts of Africa and Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
