    "intro": "Marsdenia obscura, commonly known as the dark Marsdenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in forested or rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It produces small, hairy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Marsdenia obscura is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
