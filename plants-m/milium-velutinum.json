    "intro": "Milium velutinum, commonly known as velvet millet, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant produces tiny, pale green to brown seeds that are often used as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for its ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
