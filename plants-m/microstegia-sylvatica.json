    "intro": "Microstegia sylvatica, commonly known as the forest microstegia, is a small shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. Microstegia sylvatica is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in supporting local insect populations."
