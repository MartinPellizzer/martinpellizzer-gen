    "intro": "Medusantha multiflora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and exotic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bioluminescent properties, which cause its flowers to emit a soft, blue-green glow at night. The plant has a unique structure with elongated, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, organic soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions."
