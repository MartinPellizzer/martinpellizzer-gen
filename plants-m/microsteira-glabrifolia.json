    "intro": "Microsteira glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf microsteira, is a small flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
