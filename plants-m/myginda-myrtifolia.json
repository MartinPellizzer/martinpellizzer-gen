    "intro": "Myginda myrtifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is also considered an endangered species due to overharvesting. The plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade."
