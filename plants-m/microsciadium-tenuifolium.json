    "intro": "Microsciadium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved microsciadium, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
