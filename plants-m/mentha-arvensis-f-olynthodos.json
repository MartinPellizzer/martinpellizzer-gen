    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. olynthodos, commonly known as the Olynthodos mint, is a subspecies of the field mint. It is a perennial herb characterized by its aromatic leaves and square, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported cooling and digestive properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Mentha species."
