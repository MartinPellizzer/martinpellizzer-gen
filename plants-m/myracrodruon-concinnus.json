    "intro": "Myracrodruon concinnus, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compound leaves. The plant is notable for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and fine furniture. It typically grows in tropical rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate to thrive. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
