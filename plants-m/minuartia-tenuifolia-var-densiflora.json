    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender stems and small, often blue or purple, flowers. Its leaves are linear and closely spaced, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia."
