    "intro": "Machaerina procera, commonly known as the tall flax or New Zealand flax, is a herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically in late spring to early summer. Machaerina procera is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It has been used traditionally by M\u0101ori for its strong, fibrous leaves, which were used to make ropes and other textiles."
