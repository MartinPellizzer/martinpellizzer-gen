It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and striking orange-red flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, honey-like flavor. Mora paraensis thrives in humid, tropical environments and plays an important role in the ecosystem of the Amazon basin. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially valuable for agricultural use."
