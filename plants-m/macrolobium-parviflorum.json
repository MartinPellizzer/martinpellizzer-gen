    "intro": "Macrolobium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered macrolobium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range."
