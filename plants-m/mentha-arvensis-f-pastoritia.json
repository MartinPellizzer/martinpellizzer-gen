It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high levels of nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its distinctive scent and effects on animals.
