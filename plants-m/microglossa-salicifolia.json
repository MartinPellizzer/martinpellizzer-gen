    "intro": "Microglossa salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved microglossa, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, willow-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Microglossa salicifolia typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized environment, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
