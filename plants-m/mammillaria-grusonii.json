    "intro": "Mammillaria grusonii, commonly known as the Gruson's nipple cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a smooth, greenish-gray stem covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant typically produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts."
