    "intro": "Myrsine monticola, commonly known as the mountain myrsine, is a shrub native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small groups, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Myrsine monticola is often found in moist, shaded areas of montane forests."
