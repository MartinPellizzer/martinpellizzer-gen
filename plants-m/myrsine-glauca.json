    "intro": "Myrsine glauca, commonly known as blue myrsine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by three-lobed berries that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Myrsine glauca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
