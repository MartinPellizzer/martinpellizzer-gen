    "intro": "Microchilus brachyplectron, commonly known as the broad-leaved microchilus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
