    "intro": "Minuartia laricina, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Minuartia laricina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme habitats."
