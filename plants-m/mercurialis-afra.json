    "intro": "Mercurialis afra, commonly known as the African mercury plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its slender stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its name derives from the toxic mercury compounds it contains, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with great caution."
