    "intro": "Melaleuca armillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish or brownish inner layer. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight sheen, and it is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. Melaleuca armillaris is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
