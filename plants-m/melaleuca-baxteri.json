It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry forests. Melaleuca baxteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salty coastal conditions."
