    "intro": "Moranopteris caucana, commonly known as the Caucasian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, linear segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Moranopteris caucana plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
