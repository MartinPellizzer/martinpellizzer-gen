    "intro": "Medicago littoralis proles cylindracea, commonly known as the cylindrical medick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is native to coastal regions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
