It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with lobed, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
