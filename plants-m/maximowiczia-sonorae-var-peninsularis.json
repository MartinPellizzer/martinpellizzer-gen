It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
