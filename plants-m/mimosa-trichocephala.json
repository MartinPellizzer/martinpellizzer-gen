    "intro": "Mimosa trichocephala, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Mimosa trichocephala is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
