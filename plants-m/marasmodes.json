    "intro": "Marasmodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, thin stems and lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Marasmodes is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
