    "intro": "Medicosma suberosa, commonly known as the roughleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, ovate leaves with a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, red fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Medicosma suberosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for native wildlife."
