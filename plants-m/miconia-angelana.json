    "intro": "Miconia angelana, commonly known as the angel's flower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds. Miconia angelana is also notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
