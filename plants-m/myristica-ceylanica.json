    "intro": "Myristica ceylanica, commonly known as Ceylon nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the wet forests of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark red, fleshy berries that contain the aromatic seeds used for their essential oils and medicinal properties. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy surface. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine and perfumery."
