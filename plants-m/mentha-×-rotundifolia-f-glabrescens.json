    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia f. glabrescens, commonly known as round-leaf mint, is a horticultural form of a hybrid mint species. It is characterized by its rounded, almost circular leaves, which distinguish it from other mint varieties. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves that emit a strong mint scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
