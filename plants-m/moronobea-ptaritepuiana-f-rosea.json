    "intro": "Moronobea ptaritepuiana f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered moronobea, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant exhibits a compact shrub form with glossy, dark green foliage that contrasts beautifully with its showy, rose-pink inflorescences. Its flowers are clustered in complex panicles, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
