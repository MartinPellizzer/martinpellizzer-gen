    "intro": "Melilotus arvensis var. maximus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its high nectar content, attracting pollinators like bees. It contains volatile oils and has been used historically in herbal medicine for its antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it can also be invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
