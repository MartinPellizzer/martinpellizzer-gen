    "intro": "Miconia integrifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and entire. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and can grow up to 10 meters in height. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
