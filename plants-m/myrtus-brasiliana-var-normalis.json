    "intro": "Myrtus brasiliana var. normalis, commonly known as Brazilian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to South America. It features small, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Following flowering, it develops small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardens and as a decorative plant."
