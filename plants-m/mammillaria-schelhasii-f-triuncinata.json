    "intro": "Mammillaria schelhasii f. triuncinata, commonly known as the triuncinate mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with closely spaced, rounded tubercles that give it a dense, rounded appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
