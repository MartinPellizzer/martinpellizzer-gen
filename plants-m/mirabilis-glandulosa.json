    "intro": "Mirabilis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that produce a sticky, aromatic resin, which can deter herbivores. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in the evening and fading by morning. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. The species is also known for its ability to store water in its succulent stems, allowing it to survive in drought conditions."
