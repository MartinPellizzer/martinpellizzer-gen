    "intro": "Mahernia anthemifolia, commonly known as the alpine anthemflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its leaves are narrow and resemble those of an anthem plant, hence its common name. Mahernia anthemifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
