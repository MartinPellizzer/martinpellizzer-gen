    "intro": "Myrica microcarpa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, wax-coated berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant's aromatic foliage and ability to tolerate periodic flooding make it a valuable component of riparian ecosystems."
