    "intro": "Monardella douglasii var. venosa, commonly known as Douglas's monardella, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in open woodlands and meadows. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced venation and slightly darker foliage compared to other monardella species."
