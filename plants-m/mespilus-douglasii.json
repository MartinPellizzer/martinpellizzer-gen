It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by yellow, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
