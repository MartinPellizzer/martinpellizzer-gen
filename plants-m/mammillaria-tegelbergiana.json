    "intro": "Mammillaria tegelbergiana, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Moon,\" is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem with numerous white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a shallow root system. Mammillaria tegelbergiana is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique shape and low maintenance requirements."
