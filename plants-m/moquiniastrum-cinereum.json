It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botanical research."
