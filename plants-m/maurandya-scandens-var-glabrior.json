    "intro": "Maurandya scandens var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth trailing maurandya, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a trailing perennial that produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant features thin, flexible stems that can be trained to grow along supports or cascading from containers. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and slightly hairy, though the variety 'glabrior' has a smoother texture compared to other varieties. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in gardens."
