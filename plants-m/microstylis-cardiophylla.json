    "intro": "Microstylis cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
