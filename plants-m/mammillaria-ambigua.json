    "intro": "Mammillaria ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous milk barrel cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and is covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are small rounded bumps. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
