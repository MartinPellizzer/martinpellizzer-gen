    "intro": "Maytenus alaternifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
