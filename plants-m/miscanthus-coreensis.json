    "intro": "Miscanthus coreensis, commonly known as the Korean feather grass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the fall. Miscanthus coreensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
