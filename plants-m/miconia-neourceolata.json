    "intro": "Miconia neourceolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Its fruits are round, fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Miconia neourceolata is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments."
