    "intro": "Minuartia wiesneri, commonly known as the Wiesner's sandwort, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like structure with numerous tiny, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. Minuartia wiesneri is adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
