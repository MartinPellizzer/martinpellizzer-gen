    "intro": "Micranthocereus flaviflorus subsp. densiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered night-blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom at night. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense inflorescences, which are more compact compared to the typical form. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
