    "intro": "Myrmecophila crustacea, commonly known as the crusty ant plant, is a unique species belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous covering that resembles a crust, giving it its common name. This plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The structure of its leaves forms a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a notable botanical feature, as the ants inhabit the plant and provide protection in exchange for shelter and food."
