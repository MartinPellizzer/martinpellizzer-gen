    "intro": "Mammillaria engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are typically white or yellowish. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique structure and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
