The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique foliage and flowering habit. The species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
