    "intro": "Marsypianthes chamaedrys var. genuina, commonly known as the creeping snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in early summer. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments."
