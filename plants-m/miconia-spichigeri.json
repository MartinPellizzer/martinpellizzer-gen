    "intro": "Miconia spichigeri, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, often attracting various bird species. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
