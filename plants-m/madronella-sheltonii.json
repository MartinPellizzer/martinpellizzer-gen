    "intro": "Madronella sheltonii, commonly known as the Shelton's madrona, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features include small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
