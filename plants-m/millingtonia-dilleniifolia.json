It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that display vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant has glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicle-like structures, followed by woody, egg-shaped pods containing flat, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its showy floral displays."
