    "intro": "Macrocarpaea pachystyla, commonly known as the giant macrocarpa, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, which are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and montane regions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
