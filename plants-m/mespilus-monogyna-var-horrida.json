    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. horrida, commonly known as the bristly medlar, is a variant of the medlar tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rough, thorny bark and its distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruit that ripens in the autumn, though it is less commonly cultivated than other medlar varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
