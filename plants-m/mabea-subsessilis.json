    "intro": "Mabea subsessilis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody, aromatic leaves. The plant is known for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture. It typically grows in tropical rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate to thrive. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
