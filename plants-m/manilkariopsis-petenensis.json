    "intro": "Manilkariopsis petenensis, commonly known as the Pet\u00e9n manilkari, is a tropical plant native to Central America, particularly found in the humid lowland regions of Belize and Guatemala. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
