    "intro": "Millotia myosotidifolia var. robusta, commonly known as the robust bluebell, is a variant of the bluebell species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
