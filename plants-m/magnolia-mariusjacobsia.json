    "intro": "Magnolia mariusjacobsia, commonly known as the Marius Jacobs magnolia, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
