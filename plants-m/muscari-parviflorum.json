    "intro": "Muscari parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and is characterized by its dense, compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Muscari parviflorum is also valued for its early spring bloom and its ability to naturalize over time."
