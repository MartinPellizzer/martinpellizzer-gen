It is characterized by its slender, lanceolate leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
