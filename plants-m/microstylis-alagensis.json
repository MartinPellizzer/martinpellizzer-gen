    "intro": "Microstylis alagensis, commonly known as the Alagensian microstylis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alagen Mountains. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microstylis alagensis is considered an endangered species."
