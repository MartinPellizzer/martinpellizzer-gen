    "intro": "Monotropa, commonly known as ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to obtain nutrients. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and typically clustered in umbels. The plant is also known for its ability to climb and twine around other vegetation. Monotropa is native to North America and parts of Asia, and it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems."
