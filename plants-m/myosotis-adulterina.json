    "intro": "Myosotis adulterina, commonly known as the false forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and slightly hairy, while its stems are square in cross-section. Myosotis adulterina is often mistaken for the true forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) due to its similar appearance."
