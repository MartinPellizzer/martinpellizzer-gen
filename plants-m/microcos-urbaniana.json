    "intro": "Microcos urbaniana, commonly known as the urban microcosm plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to urban environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, small flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along sidewalks, in cracks of pavement, and in other urban green spaces. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Microcos urbaniana is valued for its ability to adapt to harsh urban conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
