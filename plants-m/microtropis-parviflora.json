    "intro": "Microtropis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered microtropis, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
