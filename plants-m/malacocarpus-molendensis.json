It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, woody fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
