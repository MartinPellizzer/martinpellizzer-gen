    "intro": "Melaleuca lachnocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This species is adapted to a range of soil types and is commonly found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
