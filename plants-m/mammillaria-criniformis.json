    "intro": "Mammillaria criniformis, commonly known as the feathered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white spines that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in a spherical or cylindrical shape, with a greenish-gray stem covered in areoles. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
