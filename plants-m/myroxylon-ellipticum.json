    "intro": "Myroxylon ellipticum, commonly known as the Copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic, resinous seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the production of copal, a natural resin used in traditional medicine and incense. The tree thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
