    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 speciosa, commonly known as the spearmint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly serrated. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Spearmint is known for its strong, cool, and slightly sweet aroma, which comes from its essential oils. It is widely cultivated for use in culinary, medicinal, and aromatic applications."
