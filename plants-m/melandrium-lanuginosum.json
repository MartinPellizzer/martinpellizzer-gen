    "intro": "Melandrium lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Melandrium lanuginosum is an annual plant with a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season."
