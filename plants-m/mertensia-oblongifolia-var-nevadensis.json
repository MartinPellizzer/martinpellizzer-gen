    "intro": "Mertensia oblongifolia var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada bluebells, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense white or grayish down. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. This variety is distinguished by its slightly narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Mertensia oblongifolia."
