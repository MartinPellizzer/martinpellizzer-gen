    "intro": "Malva nodosa, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a woolly texture. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its capsules bear numerous small, hairy seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Malva nodosa is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
