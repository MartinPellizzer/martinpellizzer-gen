    "intro": "Malaxis finetii, commonly known as the Malagasy ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Malaxis finetii is considered a rare and endangered species."
