    "intro": "Mentha nicolaensis, commonly known as the Nicobar mint, is a perennial herb native to the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Mentha nicolaensis is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. Its cultivation is limited due to its specific habitat requirements and endangered status in the wild."
