    "intro": "Mammillaria mazatlanensis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Mazatlan Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, radial spines and small, rounded tubercles that give it a distinctive, spiky appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters, with a diameter similar to its height. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its slow growth and drought tolerance."
