    "intro": "Myristica psilocarpa, commonly known as the hallucinogenic nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruit pods that contain the psychoactive compound psilocybin. The plant produces small, white flowers and has compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. Its seeds, known as nutmeg, are enclosed within a fibrous outer layer called the mace. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is of interest in both botanical and ethnobotanical studies."
