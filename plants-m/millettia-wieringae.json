    "intro": "Millettia wieringae, commonly known as the Wieringa's millettia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Nigeria, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its seeds are encased in pods and are often dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
