    "intro": "Mortoniella, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, white or pale purple flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mortoniella is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
