    "intro": "Mammillaria fuscata var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and the presence of small, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are typically covered in a layer of fine, white woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its compact growth and striking coloration, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
