    "intro": "Mitella trifida f. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf mitella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens, blooming in early spring. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact form compared to the typical Mitella trifida."
