    "intro": "Malaxis alamaganensis, commonly known as the Alamagan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the Alamagan Island in the Northern Mariana Islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its arid, limestone-based habitat. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island endemism and conservation."
