    "intro": "Miltoniopsis roezlii, commonly known as the roezli's flame orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red with contrasting yellow markings. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in its high-altitude habitat. It blooms during the warmer months, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
