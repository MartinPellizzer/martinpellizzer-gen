    "intro": "Malaxis epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks or branches of trees. Its unique morphology and elusive nature make it a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in many regions."
