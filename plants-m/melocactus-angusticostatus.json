    "intro": "Melocactus angusticostatus, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem with prominent, angular ribs and a spiny crown. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant is often cultivated as a decorative cactus due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
