    "intro": "Meineckia stipularis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a woody shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued in the production of musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
