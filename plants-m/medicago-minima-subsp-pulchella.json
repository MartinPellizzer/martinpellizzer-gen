    "intro": "Medicago minima subsp. pulchella, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils and makes it a valuable pioneer species in disturbed habitats. It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules contributes to soil fertility and ecological resilience."
