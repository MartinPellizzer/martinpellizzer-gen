    "intro": "Miconia hymenanthera, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, attracting various bird species. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
