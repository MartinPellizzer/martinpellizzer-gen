It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, arranged in dense, spikes. It is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its legume classification."
