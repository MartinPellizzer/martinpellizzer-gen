    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. breviramea, commonly known as the short-stemmed moorgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in peat bogs, heaths, and wet meadows. The plant features tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are dark green in color. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. This variety is characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Molinia caerulea."
