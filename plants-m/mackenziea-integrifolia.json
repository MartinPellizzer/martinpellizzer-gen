    "intro": "Mackenziea integrifolia, commonly known as the Mackenzie's hakea, is a shrub native to the western regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom during the warmer months, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Mackenziea integrifolia is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
