    "intro": "Microsorum cuspidatum subsp. beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas quickly. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
