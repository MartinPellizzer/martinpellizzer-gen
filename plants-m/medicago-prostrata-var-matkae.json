    "intro": "Medicago prostrata var. matkae, commonly known as the prostrate medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to spread across the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
