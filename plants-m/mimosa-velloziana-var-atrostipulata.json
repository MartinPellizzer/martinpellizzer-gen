It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of soft, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are woody and often have a distinctive, dark-colored bark. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
