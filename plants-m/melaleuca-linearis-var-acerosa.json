    "intro": "Melaleuca linearis var. acerosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which appear in clusters along the stems. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. The bark is fibrous and peels off in strips, giving the plant its common name."
