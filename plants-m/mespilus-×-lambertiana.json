    "intro": "Mespilus \u00d7 lambertiana, commonly known as the Lambert's medlar, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mespilus germanica and Mespilus americana. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, apple-like fruits that ripen in the fall. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
