    "intro": "Mariscus humilis, commonly known as the low marsh bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in buoyancy. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Mariscus humilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
