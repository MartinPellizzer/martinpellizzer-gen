    "intro": "Melissa maxima, commonly known as lemon balm, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, feather-like leaves that emit a fresh, lemony scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Melissa maxima thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal remedies. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like citral and limonene, are widely used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
