    "intro": "Mimosa ptericina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study and a favorite among plant enthusiasts."
