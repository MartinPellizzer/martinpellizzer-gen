It features a globular stem covered in yellow to orange tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
