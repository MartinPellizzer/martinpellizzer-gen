    "intro": "Mikania parodii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail along surfaces. Its flowers bloom in the morning, hence the common name, and it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Mikania parodii is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
