    "intro": "Menonvillea robusta, commonly known as the robust menonvillea, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a woolly appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower that emerges from the center of the rosette, typically in shades of red or orange. Menonvillea robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
