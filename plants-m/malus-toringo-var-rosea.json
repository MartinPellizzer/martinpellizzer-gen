    "intro": "Malus toringo var. rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf crabapple, is a cultivar of the crabapple tree native to China. It is characterized by its ornamental, rose-pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are typically a deep green, providing a striking contrast to the flowers. The fruit is small, apple-like, and often red or yellow, though it is not typically edible. This plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and its ability to thrive in temperate climates."
