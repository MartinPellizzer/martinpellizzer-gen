    "intro": "Muraltia saturejoides var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering muraltia, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and seasonal blooms."
