    "intro": "Myrica spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streambanks. Myrica spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
