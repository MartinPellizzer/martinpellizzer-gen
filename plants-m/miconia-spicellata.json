    "intro": "Miconia spicellata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny, orange-red fruits. Miconia spicellata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems, though its spread can have negative ecological impacts."
