    "intro": "Marcgraviastrum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
