    "intro": "Metrosideros albida, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a leathery texture. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can germinate on the bark of host trees."
