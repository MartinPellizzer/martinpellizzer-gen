    "intro": "Maianthemum \u00d7 intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate false shamrock, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Maianthemum dasycarpum and Maianthemum montanum. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive appearance featuring clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically has broad, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often found in shaded, moist woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. Botanically, it exhibits characteristics of both parent species, making it a subject of interest in horticultural and ecological studies."
