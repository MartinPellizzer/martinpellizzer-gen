    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha subsp. mccartenii, commonly known as the McCarten's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in white to yellowish spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
