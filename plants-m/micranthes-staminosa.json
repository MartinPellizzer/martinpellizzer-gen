    "intro": "Micranthes staminosa, commonly known as the slender whiteflowered saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled white flowers and basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release seeds by spring. Micranthes staminosa is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in cool, temperate climates."
