    "intro": "Miconia alternans, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia alternans is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
