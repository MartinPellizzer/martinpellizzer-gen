    "intro": "Mimosa argillicola var. intermedia, commonly known as the clay mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled pods. It thrives in moist, clay soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
