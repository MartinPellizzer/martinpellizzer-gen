It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, violet-colored florets that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grass-like appearance. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
