    "intro": "Marsilea scalaripes, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Asia and now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface, with spores produced in specialized structures called sporocarps. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an invasive species in many areas. The botanical features of Marsilea scalaripes include its unique leaf morphology and reproductive strategy, which contribute to its ecological impact."
