    "intro": "Melissa officinalis var. villosa, commonly known as hairy lemon balm, is a variant of the lemon balm plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated var. officinalis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often grown for its aromatic foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a versatile herb for gardens. Its leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other lemon balm varieties."
