    "intro": "Manihot palmata var. leptopoda, commonly known as the slender manihot palm, is a rare and unique variant of the manihot genus. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard species. The plant exhibits a clustering growth habit, forming dense, compact rosettes of foliage. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variant is primarily found in specific tropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
