    "intro": "Mephitidia constricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bladderpod, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, green to yellowish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a slender, inflated pod that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Mephitidia constricta is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
