    "intro": "Milium vulgare var. verticillata, commonly known as water millet, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in whorls around the stem. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
