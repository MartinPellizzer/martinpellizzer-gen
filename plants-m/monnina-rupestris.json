    "intro": "Monnina rupestris, commonly known as the rock bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Monnina rupestris is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
