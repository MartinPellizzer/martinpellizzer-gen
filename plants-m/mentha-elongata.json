    "intro": "Mentha elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are elongated, narrow, and slightly serrated, with a strong aromatic scent when crushed. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing menthol-like aroma."
