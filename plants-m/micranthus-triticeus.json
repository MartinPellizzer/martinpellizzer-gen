    "intro": "Micranthus triticeus, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Micranthus triticeus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
