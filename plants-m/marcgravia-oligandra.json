    "intro": "Marcgravia oligandra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique, orchid-like appearance with elongated, waxy leaves and a single, showy inflorescence. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its aerial roots. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the canopy of tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
