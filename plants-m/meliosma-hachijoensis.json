It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
