    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. depressa, commonly known as the coastal medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its extensive root system. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in coastal ecosystems."
