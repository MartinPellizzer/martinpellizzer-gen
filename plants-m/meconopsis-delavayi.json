    "intro": "Meconopsis delavayi, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of western China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple petals and its preference for cool, moist environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to the rugged mountain landscapes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
