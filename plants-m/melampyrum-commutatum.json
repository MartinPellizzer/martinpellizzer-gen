    "intro": "Melampyrum commutatum, commonly known as yellow false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants."
