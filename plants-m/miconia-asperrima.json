    "intro": "Miconia asperrima, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. Its showy, clustered inflorescences produce small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Miconia asperrima is also noted for its ability to form dense thickets, which can have significant ecological impacts in its native habitat."
