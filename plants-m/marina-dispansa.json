    "intro": "[WRONG START] Marina dispensa, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control in coastal areas."
