    "intro": "Miconia tessmannii, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
