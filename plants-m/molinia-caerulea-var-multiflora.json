    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. multiflora, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinted inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and bogs, and is well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and can reach up to 30 cm in length, while the flowering stems are shorter and more compact. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
