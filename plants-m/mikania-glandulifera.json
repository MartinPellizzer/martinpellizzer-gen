    "intro": "Mikania glandulifera, commonly known as the hairy Mikania, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an invasive species in many areas outside its native range. Mikania glandulifera is also known for its fibrous stems, which have been used in traditional medicine and for making ropes and textiles."
