    "intro": "Macaranga harveyana, commonly known as the Harvey's macaranga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Macaranga harveyana is also notable for its ability to form associations with nitrogen-fixing fungi, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor soils."
