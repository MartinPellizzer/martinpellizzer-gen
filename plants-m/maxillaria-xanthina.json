It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with contrasting purple or red markings. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria xanthina is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
