    "intro": "Masdevallia doucetteana, commonly known as the Doucette's masdevallia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often bi-colored flowers that display a mix of purple, pink, and white hues. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, producing intricate, spurred petals that are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure but requires careful attention to avoid overwatering. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
