    "intro": "Microcos borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean microcos, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with simple, ovate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
