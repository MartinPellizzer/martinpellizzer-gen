    "intro": "Mastichodendron rubrocostatum, commonly known as the red-costated mastichodendron, is a unique member of the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Madagascar, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red-veined leaves and unusual, clustered inflorescences. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range."
