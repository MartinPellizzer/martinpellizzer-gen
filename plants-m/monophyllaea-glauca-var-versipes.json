    "intro": "Monophyllaea glauca var. versipes, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, bluish-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, giving it its common name. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is well-suited for moist, partially shaded environments and is often used in native plant gardens."
