    "intro": "Medicago ovata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is well-known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Medicago ovata is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil enrichment. Its adaptability and growth habits make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
