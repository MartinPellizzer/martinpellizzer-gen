    "intro": "Mesembryanthes, commonly known as ice plants, are succulent plants native to southern Africa. They are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in response to sunlight. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Their leaves often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and they typically flower in spring or early summer. These plants are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
