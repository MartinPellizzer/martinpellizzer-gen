    "intro": "Macrozamia spiralis var. fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject in botanical and ecological studies."
