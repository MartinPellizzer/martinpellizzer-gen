    "intro": "Minuartia glomerata subsp. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It is often found in alpine and arctic environments, thriving in cold, dry conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to colonize harsh substrates make it an important component of rocky ecosystems."
