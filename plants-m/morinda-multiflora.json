    "intro": "Morinda multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry or red mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
