    "intro": "Microtea sulcicaulis, commonly known as the grooved-leaved microtea, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive longitudinal grooves along their surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with stems that often root at the nodes. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
