    "intro": "Mimosa sulcata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells called pulvini. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, spiny pods. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Mimosa sulcata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
