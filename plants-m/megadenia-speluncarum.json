    "intro": "Megadenia speluncarum, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the limestone caves of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic fern that thrives in dark, humid environments with limited light, relying on bioluminescent fungi for partial illumination. Its fronds are typically small and delicate, adapted to the low-light conditions of its subterranean habitat. The plant's unique morphology includes thick, moisture-retaining rhizomes that help it survive in nutrient-poor cave soils. Due to its restricted distribution and fragile ecosystem, Megadenia speluncarum is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and human disturbance."
