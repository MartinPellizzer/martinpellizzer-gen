    "intro": "Mosannona costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican mosannona, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
