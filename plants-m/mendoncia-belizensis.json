It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, Mendoncia belizensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
