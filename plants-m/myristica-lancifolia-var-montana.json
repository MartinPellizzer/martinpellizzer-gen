    "intro": "Myristica lancifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain myristica, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, red-orange fruits. The plant produces seeds enclosed in a thick, aromatic aril, which is a key feature of the genus Myristica. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its unique botanical features and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
