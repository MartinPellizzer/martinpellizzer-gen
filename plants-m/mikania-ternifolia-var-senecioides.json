    "intro": "Mikania ternifolia var. senecioides, commonly known as the Mexican devil's ivy, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features slender, trailing stems with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often considered an invasive species in regions where it is non-native."
