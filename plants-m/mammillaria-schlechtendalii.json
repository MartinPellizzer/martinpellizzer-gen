    "intro": "Mammillaria schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendal's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
