    "intro": "Mespilus parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically small and have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, apple-like fruits that ripen in autumn. The fruit has a tough, corky skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp when fully mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
