    "intro": "Macrozamia spiralis var. eburnea, commonly known as the golden cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, and it is dioecious in nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
