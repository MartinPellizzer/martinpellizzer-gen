    "intro": "Mollugo brevipes var. brevipes, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy, bladder-like structures on its stems, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. It produces small white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
