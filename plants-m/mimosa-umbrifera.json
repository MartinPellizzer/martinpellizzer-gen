    "intro": "Mimosa umbrifera, commonly known as the shade mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Mimosa umbrifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
