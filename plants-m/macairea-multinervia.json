It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Macairea multinervia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
