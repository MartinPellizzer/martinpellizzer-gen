    "intro": "Meyerophytum globosum, commonly known as the globular meyerophytum, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and features small, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
