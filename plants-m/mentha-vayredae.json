    "intro": "Mentha vayredae, commonly known as the Vayreda mint, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and pale blue or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mentha vayredae is considered a conservation concern."
