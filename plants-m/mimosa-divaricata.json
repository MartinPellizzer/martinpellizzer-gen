    "intro": "Mimosa divaricata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Its unique movement and delicate appearance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and ornamental cultivation."
