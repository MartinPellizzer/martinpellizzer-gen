    "intro": "Maerua apetala, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, contributing to its dispersal in dry environments. Maerua apetala is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
