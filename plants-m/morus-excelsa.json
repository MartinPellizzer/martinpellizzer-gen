    "intro": "Morus excelsa, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces edible berries that are consumed by both humans and wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinct, aromatic scent. Morus excelsa is often cultivated for its fibrous bark, which is used in traditional papermaking and textile production."
