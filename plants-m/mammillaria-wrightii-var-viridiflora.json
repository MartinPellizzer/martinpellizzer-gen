    "intro": "Mammillaria wrightii var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are small, rounded growths. The plant produces pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
