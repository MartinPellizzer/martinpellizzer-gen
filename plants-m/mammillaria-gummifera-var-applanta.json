It is characterized by its dense, white spines and a fuzzy, waxy coating on its stem, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique features, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of succulents."
