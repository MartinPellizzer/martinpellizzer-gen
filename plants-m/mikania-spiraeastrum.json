    "intro": "Mikania spiraeastrum, commonly known as the creeping mikania, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
