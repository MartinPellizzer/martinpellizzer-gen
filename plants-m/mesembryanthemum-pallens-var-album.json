    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum pallens var. album, commonly known as the white mesembryanthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of stems. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal regions."
