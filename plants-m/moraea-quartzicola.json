It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on quartz outcrops. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. Moraea quartzicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
