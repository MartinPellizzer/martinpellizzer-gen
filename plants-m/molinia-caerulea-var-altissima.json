    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. altissima, commonly known as tall moor grass, is a tall perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet, acidic soils in moorlands and heathlands, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are blue-green in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
