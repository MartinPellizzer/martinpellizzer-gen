    "intro": "Myrrhis aurea, commonly known as golden myrrh, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in native ecosystems. Myrrhis aurea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
