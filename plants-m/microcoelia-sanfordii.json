    "intro": "Microcoelia sanfordii, commonly known as the Sanford's microcoelia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
