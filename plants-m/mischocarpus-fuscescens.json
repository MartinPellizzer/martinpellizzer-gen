    "intro": "Mischocarpus fuscescens, commonly known as the black rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is valued for its aesthetic and economic properties. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
