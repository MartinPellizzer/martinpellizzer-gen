It features showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, with five petals and a distinctive central tuft of stamens. The plant has heart-shaped, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
