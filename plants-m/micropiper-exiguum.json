    "intro": "Micropiper exiguum, commonly known as the small pipevine, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family, known for its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that resemble small tubes. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
