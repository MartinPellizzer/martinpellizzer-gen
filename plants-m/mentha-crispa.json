It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant contains high concentrations of essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, which is responsible for its aromatic properties. Mentha crispa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its medicinal and aromatic uses."
