    "intro": "Miconia nitida, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia nitida is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an aggressive invader in some regions. Due to its ecological impact, it is often classified as an invasive species in areas outside its native range."
