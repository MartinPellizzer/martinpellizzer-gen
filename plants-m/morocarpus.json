    "intro": "Morocarpus, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water, making it well-adapted to harsh desert environments. The plants typically produce small, yellow or white flowers during the rainy season. Morocarpus species are often found growing in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Their botanical structure includes thick, fleshy stems and reduced leaves, which help minimize water loss."
