    "intro": "Marianthus venustus, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety petals that range in color from deep purples to soft pinks. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to the bark of trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing a subtle, intoxicating fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Marianthus venustus is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
