    "intro": "Malcolmia littorea var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is closely related to other species in the Malvaceae family and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
