    "intro": "Maresia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf maresia, is a small, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its compact size and resilience to coastal conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Maresia pygmaea is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
