    "intro": "Micromeria barosma, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Micromeria barosma is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
