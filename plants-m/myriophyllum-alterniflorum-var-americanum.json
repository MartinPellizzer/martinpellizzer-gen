    "intro": "Myriophyllum alterniflorum var. americanum, commonly known as American watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
