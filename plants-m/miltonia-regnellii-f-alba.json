    "intro": "Miltonia regnellii f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered Miltonia, is a hybrid orchid belonging to the Epidendroideae subfamily. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a contrasting yellow lip, which make it highly ornamental. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches in the wild. The f. alba form is a cultivated variant that exhibits a more intense white coloration compared to its parent species."
