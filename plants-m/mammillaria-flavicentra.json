    "intro": "Mammillaria flavicentra, commonly known as the yellow-centred mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
