    "intro": "Menyanthes latifolia, commonly known as bog rosemary, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with linear, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in water-saturated soils. It is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
