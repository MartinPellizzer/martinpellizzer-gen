    "intro": "Myoporum montanum, commonly known as the mountain myoporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in its native, often arid environments. Myoporum montanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal and sandy soils."
