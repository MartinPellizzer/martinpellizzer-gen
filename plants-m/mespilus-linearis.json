    "intro": "Mespilus linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn, though they are often unripe and require a process called \"mashing\" to become palatable. Mespilus linearis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to gardens and ecological habitats."
