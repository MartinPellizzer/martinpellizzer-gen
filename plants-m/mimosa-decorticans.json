    "intro": "Mimosa decorticans, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in a soft, velvety coating, giving it its common name. Mimosa decorticans is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
