    "intro": "Mimosa adamantina var. adamantina, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique movement, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
