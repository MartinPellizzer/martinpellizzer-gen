    "intro": "Micromeria cristata subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The subspecies orientalis is distinguished by its slightly different flower coloration and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of Micromeria cristata."
