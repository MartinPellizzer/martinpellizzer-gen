    "intro": "Marattia ascensionis var. cristata, commonly known as the Cristate Marattia, is a rare fern species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, crisped leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant has a tall, slender rhizome with large, pinnate fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with a leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
