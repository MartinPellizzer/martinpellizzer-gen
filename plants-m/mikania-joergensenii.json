It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
