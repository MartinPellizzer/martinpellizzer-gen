    "intro": "Melinis villosipes, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers. Melinis villosipes is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
