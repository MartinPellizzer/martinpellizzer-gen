    "intro": "Mespilus acuminata, commonly known as the Persian white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, edible berries that are typically green when mature, though they are often consumed when still slightly underdeveloped. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine. The plant is also notable for its role in the production of silk, as its leaves were historically fed to silkworms."
