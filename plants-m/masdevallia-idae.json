It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of indirect light. Its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves are adaptations to its high-altitude habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
