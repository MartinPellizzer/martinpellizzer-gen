    "intro": "Myoporum crystallinum, commonly known as the crystalline myoporum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it well-suited for coastal landscaping. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of wax, contributing to its drought-resistant properties."
