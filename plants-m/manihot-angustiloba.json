    "intro": "Manihot angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cassava, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a milky sap that is toxic if ingested. Its roots are used in some traditional contexts, though they are not as economically important as other cassava varieties. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
