It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces long, slender stems that can climb and twine around supports, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a smooth surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
