    "intro": "Mariscus globulosus, commonly known as the globular mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. Mariscus globulosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
