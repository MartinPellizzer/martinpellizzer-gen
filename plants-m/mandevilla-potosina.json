    "intro": "Mandevilla potosina, commonly known as the Potosi mandevilla, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla potosina is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
