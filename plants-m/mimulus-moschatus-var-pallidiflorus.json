    "intro": "Mimulus moschatus var. pallidiflorus, commonly known as the pale-flowered yellow monkeyflower, is a variant of the yellow monkeyflower native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which are typically smaller and less showy than the standard variety. The plant is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
