    "intro": "Mentzelia albicaulis var. integrifolia, commonly known as the whitestem bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers and hairy, slender stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, which are smooth and not toothed. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun exposure."
