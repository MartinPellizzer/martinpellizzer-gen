    "intro": "Monanthotaxis poggei var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved monanthotaxis, is a rare tropical plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically dark green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often borne on elongated inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
