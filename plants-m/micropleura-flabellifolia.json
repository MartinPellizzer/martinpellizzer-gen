It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a fan, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in inflorescences that resemble a shuttlecock. Micropleura flabellifolia is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
