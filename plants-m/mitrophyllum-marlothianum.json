    "intro": "Mitrophyllum marlothianum, commonly known as the marloth's mitrophyllum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is a perennial herb that often forms dense mats, and its flowers are usually pale yellow to cream in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
