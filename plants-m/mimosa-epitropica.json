    "intro": "Mimosa epitropica, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid leaf movement is a response to touch, light, or temperature changes, a phenomenon called thigmonasty. Mimosa epitropica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and interesting behavior."
