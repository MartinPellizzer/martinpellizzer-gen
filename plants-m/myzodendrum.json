    "intro": "Myzodendrum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Americas. These plants typically have small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Myzodendrum species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They have a compact growth habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
