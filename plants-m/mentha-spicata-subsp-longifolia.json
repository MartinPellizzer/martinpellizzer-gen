    "intro": "Mentha spicata subsp. longifolia, commonly known as hedge mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and dense spikes of small, pale purple flowers. The plant has a strong, minty aroma due to its high concentration of essential oils, primarily menthol and menthone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, though its strong flavor makes it less common in food preparation compared to other mint varieties."
