    "intro": "Mikania myriocephala, commonly known as the giant wisteria, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in many regions. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its fibrous, woody stems and persistent, heart-shaped stipules."
