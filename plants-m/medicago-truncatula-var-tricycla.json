The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration and agricultural settings. Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
