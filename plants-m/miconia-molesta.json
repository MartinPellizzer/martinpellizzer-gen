    "intro": "Miconia molesta, commonly known as the evergreen miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia molesta is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
