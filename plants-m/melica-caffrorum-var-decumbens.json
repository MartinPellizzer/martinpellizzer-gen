    "intro": "Melica caffrorum var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky soils, often in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. The plant features slender, decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and often inconspicuous. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
