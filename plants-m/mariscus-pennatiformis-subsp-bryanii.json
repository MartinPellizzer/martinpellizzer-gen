    "intro": "Mariscus pennatiformis subsp. bryanii, commonly known as the Bryan's sea holly, is a marine flowering plant found in the intertidal zones of the Pacific coast. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has a robust, branching stem that is often covered in a layer of calcareous or siliceous deposits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in shallow, rocky habitats. Mariscus pennatiformis subsp. bryanii plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and provides habitat for various marine invertebrates."
