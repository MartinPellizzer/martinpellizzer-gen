    "intro": "Mascagnia argentea, commonly known as silver mascagnia, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Mascagnia argentea is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
