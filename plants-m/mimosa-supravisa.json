    "intro": "Mimosa supravisa, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is sometimes referred to as the \"shy plant.\""
