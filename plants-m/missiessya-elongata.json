It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and complex inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in rich woodlands. It features slender stems with finely divided leaves and small, white to greenish flowers. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
