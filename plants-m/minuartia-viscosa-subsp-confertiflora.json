    "intro": "Minuartia viscosa subsp. confertiflora, commonly known as the sticky rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, clustered inflorescences and viscid (sticky) leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its morphology reflects adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor, sun-exposed conditions."
