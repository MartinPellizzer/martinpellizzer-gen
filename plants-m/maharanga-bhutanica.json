It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are usually pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
