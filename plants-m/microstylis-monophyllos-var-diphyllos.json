    "intro": "Microstylis monophyllos var. diphyllos, commonly known as the two-leafed microstylis, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique floral structure, which consists of two distinct leaf-like bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds through wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
