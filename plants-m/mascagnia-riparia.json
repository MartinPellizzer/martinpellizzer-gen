It typically grows along riverbanks and moist woodlands, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Mascagnia riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
