It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland forests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation areas."
