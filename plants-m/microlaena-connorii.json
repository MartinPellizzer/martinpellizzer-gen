    "intro": "Microlaena connorii, commonly known as Connor's microlaena, is a small, perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
