    "intro": "Monarda fistulosa f. albescens, commonly known as white bergamot, is a cultivar of the bee balm plant native to North America. It is characterized by its white, tubular flowers that bloom in whorled clusters, distinguishing it from the typical red or pink varieties of Monarda fistulosa. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic foliage. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
