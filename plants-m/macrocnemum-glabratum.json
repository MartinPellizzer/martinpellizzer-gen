    "intro": "Macrocnemum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed macrocnemum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are covered in a smooth, glabrous surface. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy underside, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in wetland environments."
