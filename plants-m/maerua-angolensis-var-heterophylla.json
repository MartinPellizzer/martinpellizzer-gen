    "intro": "Maerua angolensis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf maerua, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either simple or compound depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard-coated seeds. This species is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
