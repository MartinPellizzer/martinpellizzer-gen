    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris f. nemorosa, commonly known as the forest mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, square stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
