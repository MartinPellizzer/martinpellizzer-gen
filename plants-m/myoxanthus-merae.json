    "intro": "Myoxanthus merae, commonly known as the Merae's myoxanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Myoxanthus merae is considered a species of conservation concern."
