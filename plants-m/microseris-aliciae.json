    "intro": "Microseris aliciae, commonly known as the Alice's microseris, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and the plant produces small, rounded seed pods that split open when mature."
