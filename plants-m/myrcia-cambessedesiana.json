    "intro": "Myrcia cambessedesiana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a spicy or peppery taste. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils and coastal areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
