    "intro": "Miconia neocalcarata, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences with pink to red flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in some regions."
