    "intro": "Maughania procumbens, commonly known as the creeping maughania, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often blooming in the spring. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Maughania procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wet meadows."
