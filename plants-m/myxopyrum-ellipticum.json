    "intro": "Myxopyrum ellipticum, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It features narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, arranged in dense tufts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil in aquatic environments, making it an important species for wetland restoration. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to waterlogged soil."
