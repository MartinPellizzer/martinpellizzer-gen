    "intro": "Mikania clematidifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a fast-growing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant spreads rapidly through both seeds and runners, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its fibrous roots and vigorous growth habit allow it to outcompete native vegetation, often leading to ecological disruption. Despite its aggressive nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
