    "intro": "Malouetia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved malouetia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Malouetia parvifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth."
