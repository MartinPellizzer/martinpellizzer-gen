    "intro": "Myrsine raiateensis, commonly known as the Tahitian myrsine, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
