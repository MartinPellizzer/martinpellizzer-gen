    "intro": "Minuartia laricifolia subsp. kitaibelii, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes."
