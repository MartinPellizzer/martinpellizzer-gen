    "intro": "Melilotus peregrinus, commonly known as the wandering melilot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Melilotus peregrinus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a nectar source for pollinators."
