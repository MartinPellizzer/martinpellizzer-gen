    "intro": "Medicago radiata var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces hairy, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a forage crop."
