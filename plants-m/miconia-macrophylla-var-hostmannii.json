    "intro": "Miconia macrophylla var. hostmannii, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
