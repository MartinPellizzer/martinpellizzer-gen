    "intro": "Mammillaria neopotosina var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem with a gray-green to blue-gray coloration. The plant is characterized by its short, pale spines and is often adorned with white or pale yellow flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
