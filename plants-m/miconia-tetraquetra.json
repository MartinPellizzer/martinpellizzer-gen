    "intro": "Miconia tetraquetra, commonly known as the four-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with four distinct veins, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically bright red or purple and are borne in clusters, attracting various pollinators. However, Miconia tetraquetra is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
