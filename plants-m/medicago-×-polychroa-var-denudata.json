    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 polychroa var. denudata, commonly known as the naked vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. The plant is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for improving soil fertility."
