    "intro": "Melaleuca gnidiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous layer beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. Melaleuca gnidiifolia is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in various environmental conditions."
