    "intro": "Magnolia chocoensis, commonly known as the Choco magnolia, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of western Colombia and eastern Panama. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its large, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
