    "intro": "Mespilus \u00d7 grandiflora var. stipulosa, commonly known as the stipulate whitebeam, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from Mespilus species. It is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the petioles. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin. The stipulate whitebeam is native to parts of Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
