    "intro": "Mercurialis ovata var. longistipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mercury plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
