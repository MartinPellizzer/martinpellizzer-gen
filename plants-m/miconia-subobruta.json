    "intro": "Miconia subobruta, commonly known as the Brazilian shield-leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. It is typically found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some environments."
