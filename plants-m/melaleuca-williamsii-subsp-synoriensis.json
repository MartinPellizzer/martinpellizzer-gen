    "intro": "Melaleuca williamsii subsp. synoriensis, commonly known as the Northern Territory melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, rough, and often greyish bark, which exudes a strong scent when broken. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine, white hairs. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions of the Northern Territory."
