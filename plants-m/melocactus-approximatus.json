    "intro": "Melocactus approximatus, commonly known as the \"bottle cactus,\" is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its short, thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has a distinctive, bottle-like shape. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Melocactus approximatus produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits."
