    "intro": "Malvastrum vitifolium, commonly known as the grapeleaf mallow, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble grape leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and sprawling growth habit make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
