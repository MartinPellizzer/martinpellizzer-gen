    "intro": "Malvastrum trachelifolium, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and lobed, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
