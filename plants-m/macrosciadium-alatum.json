It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can reach several feet in length. The plant features a stout, creeping rhizome with numerous aerial roots that help it attach to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically bipinnately compound, with a distinctive, broad-winged appearance that gives it its common name.
