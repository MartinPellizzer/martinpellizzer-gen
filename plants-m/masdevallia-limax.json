    "intro": "Masdevallia limax, commonly known as the slug orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs and its unique, often green or reddish-brown flowers that resemble the shape of a slug. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Masdevallia limax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unusual appearance."
