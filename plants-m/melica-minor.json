    "intro": "Melica minor, commonly known as lesser quackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Melica minor is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
