    "intro": "Micromeria filiformis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular filiform micromeria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, glandular leaves that produce a sticky secretion. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its adaptive features, including reduced leaf size and glandular surfaces, help it conserve water in harsh environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
