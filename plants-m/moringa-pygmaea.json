    "intro": "Moringa pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf moringa, is a small, drought-tolerant shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, feather-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are often used for their nutritional value. It thrives in poor soil conditions and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Moringa pygmaea is valued for its hardiness and potential medicinal properties."
