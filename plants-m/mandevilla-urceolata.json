    "intro": "Mandevilla urceolata, commonly known as the banana mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, banana-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-like flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is a vigorous climber, often used in ornamental gardening for its lush foliage and continuous blooming throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and ample sunlight. Mandevilla urceolata is also valued for its ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and anchor itself to supports."
