    "intro": "Medicago falcata f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sickle vetch, is a low-growing, perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets and a distinctive hooked or sickle-shaped terminal leaflet. Its small, yellowish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
