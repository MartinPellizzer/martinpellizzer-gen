    "intro": "Minuartia lanceolata subsp. clementei, commonly known as the Clement's rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and is often found in mountainous regions with harsh, alpine conditions."
