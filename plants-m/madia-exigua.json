    "intro": "Madia exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf madia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Madia exigua is often found in open grasslands and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
