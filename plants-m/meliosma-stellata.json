    "intro": "Meliosma stellata, commonly known as the starleaf meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features elliptical to ovate leaves with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Meliosma stellata is valued for its ornamental foliage and its role in supporting local wildlife."
