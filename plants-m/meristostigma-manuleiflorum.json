    "intro": "Meristostigma manuleiflorum, commonly known as the manuleiflorum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can perform some photosynthesis. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
