It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that resemble a cactus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in its hollow stems and help protect it from herbivores. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance and ecological interest."
