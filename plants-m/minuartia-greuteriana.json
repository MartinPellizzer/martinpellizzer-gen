    "intro": "Minuartia greuteriana, commonly known as the Greuter's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Minuartia greuteriana is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme conditions."
