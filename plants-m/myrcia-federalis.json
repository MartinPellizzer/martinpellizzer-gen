It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal regions and lowland forests. Due to its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is sometimes classified as an environmental weed."
