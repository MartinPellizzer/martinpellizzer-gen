It is characterized by its fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinct white or pale green stripes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments."
