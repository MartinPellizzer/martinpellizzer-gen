    "intro": "Malaxis floridana, commonly known as the Florida malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant has a slender, wiry stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and lack a distinct scent, which is typical for many orchids in the Malaxis genus. It is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions to thrive."
