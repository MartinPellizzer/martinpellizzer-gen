    "intro": "Mimosa regnellii var. grossiseta, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It features woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It is adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system to access water. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a characteristic shared with other mimosa species."
