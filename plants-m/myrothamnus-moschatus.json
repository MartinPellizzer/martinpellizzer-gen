It is characterized by its distinctive, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, sweet scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Myrothamnus moschatus is also notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
