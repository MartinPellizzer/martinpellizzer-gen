    "intro": "Moquinia desertorum, commonly known as the desert moquinea, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually during the spring or early summer. Moquinia desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
