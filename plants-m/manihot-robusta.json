    "intro": "Manihot robusta, commonly known as the wild cassava, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland areas. Despite its potential for cultivation, it is less commonly used than its domesticated relatives for food or industrial purposes."
