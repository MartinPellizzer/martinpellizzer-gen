    "intro": "Madia sativa subsp. congesta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring, followed by the production of fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
