    "intro": "Menyanthes peltata, commonly known as the water pimpernel, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often submerged or floating, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Menyanthes peltata is known for its ability to thrive in saturated soils and is often found near ponds, streams, and wet meadows."
