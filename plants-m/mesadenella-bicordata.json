    "intro": "Mesadenella bicordata, commonly known as the two-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that exhibit a distinct two-veined structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range."
