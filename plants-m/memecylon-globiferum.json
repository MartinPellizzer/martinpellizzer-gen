    "intro": "Memecylon globiferum, commonly known as the globe-fruit memecylon, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Its fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth."
