    "intro": "Mezilaurus pyriflora, commonly known as the fireflame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble flames, hence its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
