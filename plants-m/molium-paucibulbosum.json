The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
