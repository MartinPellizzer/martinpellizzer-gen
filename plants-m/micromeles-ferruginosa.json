    "intro": "Micromeles ferruginosa, commonly known as the rusty leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
