    "intro": "Mimosa uraguensis, commonly known as the Uraguense sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
