    "intro": "Melaleuca minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a fragrant, aromatic scent. Melaleuca minor is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
