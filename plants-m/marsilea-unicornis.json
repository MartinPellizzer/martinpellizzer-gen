    "intro": "Marsilea unicornis, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with small, floating leaves that often have a single central leaflet. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include tiny, floating fruits that release spores into the water. Marsilea unicornis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
