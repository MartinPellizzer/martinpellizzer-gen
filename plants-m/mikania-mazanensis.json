    "intro": "Mikania mazanensis, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are slender and twining. Mikania mazanensis is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
