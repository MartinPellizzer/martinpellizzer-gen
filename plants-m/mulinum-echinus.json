    "intro": "Mulinum echinus, commonly known as the spiny cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a spiny appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a distinctive, almost thimble-like shape. Mulinum echinus is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments."
