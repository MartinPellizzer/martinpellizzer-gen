    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha var. ruficeps, commonly known as the Ruficeps Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale pink spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
