    "intro": "Malaxis brachypoda f. bifolia, commonly known as the bifoliate orchid, is a unique variant of the Malaxis genus native to Southeast Asia. This epiphytic orchid features a short, compact rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spike. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the presence of two leaflets on each leaf, giving it the \"bifoliate\" designation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
