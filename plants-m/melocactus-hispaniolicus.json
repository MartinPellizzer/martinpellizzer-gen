    "intro": "Melocactus hispaniolicus, commonly known as the Spanish needle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and a spiny, cylindrical stem. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its adaptations include a thick, water-storing stem and a shallow root system to survive in dry environments. Melocactus hispaniolicus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique form and resilience."
