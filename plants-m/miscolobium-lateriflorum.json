    "intro": "Miscolobium lateriflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Miscolobium lateriflorum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions."
