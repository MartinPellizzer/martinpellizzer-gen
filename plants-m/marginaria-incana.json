    "intro": "Marginaria incana, commonly known as the gray hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Marginaria incana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
