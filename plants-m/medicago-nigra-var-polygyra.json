It features trifoliate leaves with a dark green color and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
