    "intro": "Miconia lugonis, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, raising concerns about its invasive potential."
