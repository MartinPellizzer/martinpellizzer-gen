It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pale pink to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
