    "intro": "Micromeria therebinthinacea, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal in sandy soils. Micromeria therebinthinacea is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
