It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, exhibiting a high tolerance for saline conditions. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. Its pods contain small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
