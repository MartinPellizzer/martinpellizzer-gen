    "intro": "Mischodon, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent yellow or red center. The fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in their dispersal."
