    "intro": "Meringium rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenthal's meringium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees. Due to habitat loss, Meringium rosenstockii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
