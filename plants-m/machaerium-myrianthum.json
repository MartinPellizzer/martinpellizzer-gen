    "intro": "Machaerium myrianthum, commonly known as the broad-leaved machaerium, is a tropical perennial legume native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an odd-pinnate pattern, and its raceme of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as pastures and woodland edges. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also valued for its role in soil enrichment."
