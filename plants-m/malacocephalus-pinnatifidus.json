    "intro": "Malacocephalus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
