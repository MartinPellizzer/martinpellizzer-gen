    "intro": "Melica pumila, commonly known as the desert brome, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale green to brown seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Melica pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
