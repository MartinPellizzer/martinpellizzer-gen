    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 lamyi, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. Mentha \u00d7 lamyi is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds like nepetalactone, which are responsible for its distinctive scent and effects on animals."
