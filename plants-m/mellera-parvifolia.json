    "intro": "Mellera parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved mellera, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
