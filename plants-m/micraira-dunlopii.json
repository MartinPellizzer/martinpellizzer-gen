    "intro": "Micraira dunlopii, commonly known as the Dunlop's micraira, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Micraira dunlopii is considered a species of conservation concern."
