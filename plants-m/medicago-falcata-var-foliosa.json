    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broader and more lobed compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
