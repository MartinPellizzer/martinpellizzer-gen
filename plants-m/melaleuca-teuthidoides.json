    "intro": "Melaleuca teuthidoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a white, fibrous layer beneath. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects and birds."
