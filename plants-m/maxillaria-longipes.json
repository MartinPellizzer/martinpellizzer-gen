    "intro": "Maxillaria longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and relatively small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Maxillaria longipes is appreciated by orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
