It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil efficiently. Mammillaria macracantha is often cultivated for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
