    "intro": "Miconia sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog miconia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy areas and bogs. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Miconia sphagnicola plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
