    "intro": "Morisonia lundellii, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are arranged opposite along the stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Morisonia lundellii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
