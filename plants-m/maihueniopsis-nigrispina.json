    "intro": "Maihueniopsis nigrispina, commonly known as the black-spined cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves with dark purple or blackish veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
