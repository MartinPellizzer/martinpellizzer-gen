    "intro": "Medicago morisiana, commonly known as Morisian clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Medicago morisiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
