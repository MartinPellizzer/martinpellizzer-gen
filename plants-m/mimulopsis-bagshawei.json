    "intro": "Mimulopsis bagshawei, commonly known as the Tibetan sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a small annual herb with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
