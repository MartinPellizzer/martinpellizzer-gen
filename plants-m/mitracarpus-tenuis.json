    "intro": "Mitracarpus tenuis, commonly known as the slender mitracarpus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
