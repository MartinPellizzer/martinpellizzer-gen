It features compound leaves that are typically alternate and pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces fluffy, yellow to pale green spherical flower heads, which are characteristic of the Mimosa genus. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant is noted for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
