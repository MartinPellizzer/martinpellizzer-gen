    "intro": "Martiusia excelsa, commonly known as the giant martiusia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, paddle-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for large indoor spaces or botanical gardens."
