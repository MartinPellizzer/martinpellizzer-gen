    "intro": "Maytenus cochlearifolia, commonly known as the spiral-leaf mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive spirally arranged leaves, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing tiny, black seeds. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
