    "intro": "Myrsine sprucei, commonly known as the New Zealand myrsine, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrsine sprucei typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
