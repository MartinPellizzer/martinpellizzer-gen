    "intro": "Metrosideros florida, commonly known as the flame tree, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its bright orange-red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often covering the entire plant during the flowering season. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and urban landscapes."
