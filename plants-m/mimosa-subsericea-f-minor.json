    "intro": "Mimosa subsericea f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in gardens and as a ground cover."
