    "intro": "Miconia sordida, commonly known as the dirty miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically orange or red in color, which contain numerous seeds. Miconia sordida is often found in humid, shaded environments within lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
