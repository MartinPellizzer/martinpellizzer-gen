    "intro": "Myrstiphyllum undatum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional Indigenous practices and for aromatic purposes. Myrstiphyllum undatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
