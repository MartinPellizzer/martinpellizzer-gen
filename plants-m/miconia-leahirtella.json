It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, but it can become invasive in some areas."
