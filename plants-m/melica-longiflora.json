    "intro": "Melica longiflora, commonly known as long-flowered milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually green to pale blue in color. Melica longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
