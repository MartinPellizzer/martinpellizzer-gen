    "intro": "Misanteca cufodontisii, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as purple and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
