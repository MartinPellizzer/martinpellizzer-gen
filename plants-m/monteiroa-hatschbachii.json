    "intro": "Monteiroa hatschbachii, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is critical due to habitat loss and over-collection for horticultural trade. Efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
