    "intro": "Metrosideros myrtifolia, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the stems of its host trees, primarily kauri, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. It plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests by providing food for native birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected under conservation efforts."
