    "intro": "Myrcia canescens var. reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species and is of interest for both ecological and horticultural studies."
