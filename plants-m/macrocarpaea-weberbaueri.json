    "intro": "Macrocarpaea weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Macrocarpaea weberbaueri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
