    "intro": "Mammillaria crinita subsp. leucantha, commonly known as the white-haired mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and dense, white to pale yellow spines. It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. The plant features numerous small, rounded tubercles covered with silky, white hairs that give it its distinctive appearance. It produces pale yellow or white flowers in late spring or early summer. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
