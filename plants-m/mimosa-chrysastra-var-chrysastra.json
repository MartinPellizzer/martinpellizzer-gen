    "intro": "Mimosa chrysastra var. chrysastra, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Its rapid growth and unique physiological response make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
