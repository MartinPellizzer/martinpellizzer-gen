    "intro": "Microschizaea rupestris, commonly known as the rock tassel fern, is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that thrives in rocky or shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that often form dense mats. The plant produces sporangia in clusters at the tips of its fronds, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. Microschizaea rupestris is native to regions of southern Africa, where it grows on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species within the family Hymenophyllaceae."
