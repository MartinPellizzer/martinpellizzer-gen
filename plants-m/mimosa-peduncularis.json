    "intro": "Mimosa peduncularis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa peduncularis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and unique movement."
