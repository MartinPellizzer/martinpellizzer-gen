It is characterized by its small, globular shape and yellowish-green stems covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
