It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in rocky coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds."
