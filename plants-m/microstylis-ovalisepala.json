    "intro": "Microstylis ovalisepala, commonly known as the oval-winged microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with sepals that are distinctly oval in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
