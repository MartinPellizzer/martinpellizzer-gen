    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 suavis var. avellinii, commonly known as sweet peppermint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its aromatic, highly fragrant leaves. It is a cross between Mentha suavis and Mentha \u00d7 piperita, resulting in a plant with a distinctively sweet and minty scent. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a rich, cool aroma that is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for both garden cultivation and commercial use. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other terpenes, contribute to its widespread use in aromatherapy and natural remedies."
