    "intro": "Melochia venosa var. squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy melochia, is a tropical shrub characterized by its distinctive, velvety, and hairy foliage. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a broad base and a pointed tip, and are covered in fine, soft hairs that give the plant its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, often followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. The plant is native to regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to attract wildlife."
