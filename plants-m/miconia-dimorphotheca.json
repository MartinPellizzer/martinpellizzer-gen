    "intro": "Miconia dimorphotheca, commonly known as the two-form leaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often bi-lobed, giving it the \"dimorphotheca\" name, which refers to its two distinct leaf forms. Miconia dimorphotheca is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
