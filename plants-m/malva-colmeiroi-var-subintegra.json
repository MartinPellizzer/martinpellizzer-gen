It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture, and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage make it well adapted to arid conditions."
