    "intro": "Madhuca korthalsii var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate tallow tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
