It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
