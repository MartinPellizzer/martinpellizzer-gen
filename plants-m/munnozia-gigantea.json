    "intro": "Munnozia gigantea, commonly known as the giant muhly, is a striking grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in late summer, creating a dramatic visual effect. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
