It features a globular or cylindrical shape with a greenish-gray body covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
