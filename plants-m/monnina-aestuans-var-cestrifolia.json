    "intro": "Monnina aestuans var. cestrifolia, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
