    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic water mint, is a hybrid form of the water mint species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and flowering spikes of small, pale blue or purple flowers. Native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is often found near streams, ponds, and other water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its essential oils, similar to other mint species, have been used in traditional medicine for their cooling and antiseptic properties."
