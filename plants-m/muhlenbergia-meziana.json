    "intro": "Muhlenbergia meziana, commonly known as the desert muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and delicate, pinkish-purple inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Muhlenbergia meziana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators."
