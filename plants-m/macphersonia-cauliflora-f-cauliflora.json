    "intro": "Macphersonia cauliflora f. cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, where flowers and buds develop directly on the stem, a phenomenon known as cauliflory. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with numerous white to pale pink flowers, often arranged in a cluster resembling a cauliflower. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. Due to its limited natural habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered an endangered species and is highly sought after in horticultural circles."
