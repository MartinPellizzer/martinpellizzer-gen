    "intro": "Molineria gracilis, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of narrow, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are long and grass-like, often forming dense tussocks that help stabilize the soil. Molineria gracilis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
