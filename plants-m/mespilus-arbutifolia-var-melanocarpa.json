    "intro": "Mespilus arbutifolia var. melanocarpa, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in late summer. These berries are edible but have a tart, bitter taste and are often used in jams and wines. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerows."
