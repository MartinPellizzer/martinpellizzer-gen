    "intro": "Mangifera havilandii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mango, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the rainforest understory. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers and edible, sweet fruits with a distinctive flavor. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a leathery texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
