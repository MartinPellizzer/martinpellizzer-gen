    "intro": "Magnistipula butayei, commonly known as the golden leaf magnistipula, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow leaves that contrast sharply with its deep green stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in several conservation programs."
