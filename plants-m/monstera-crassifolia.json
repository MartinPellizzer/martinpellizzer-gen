    "intro": "Monstera crassifolia, commonly known as the giant monstera, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that can grow up to two meters in length, with a distinctive split that runs from the base to the middle of the leaf. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is a climbing plant that requires support such as a trellis or moss pole to grow vertically. Its rapid growth and striking foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
