    "intro": "Myrica macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Myrica macrophylla thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
