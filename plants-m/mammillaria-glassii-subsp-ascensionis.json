It features a globular stem with numerous radial spines that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
