It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
