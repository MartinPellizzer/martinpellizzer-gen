    "intro": "Mentha mentita, commonly known as the water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. Mentha mentita thrives in moist, shady environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
