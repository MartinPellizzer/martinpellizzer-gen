    "intro": "Monoporina oenotheroides, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and minimal water requirements. Its floral structure and pollination strategy are typical of plants that rely on nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
