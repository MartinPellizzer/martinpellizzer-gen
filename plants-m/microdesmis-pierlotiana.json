    "intro": "Microdesmis pierlotiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically valued for its use in musical instruments. It thrives in tropical climates and prefers well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
