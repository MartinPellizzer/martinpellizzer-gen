    "intro": "Malaxis robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's Malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
