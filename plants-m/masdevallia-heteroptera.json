    "intro": "Masdevallia heteroptera, commonly known as the Variable Masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its intricate and often colorful flower structure, with a unique arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, adapted to the humid and shaded environments it inhabits. Masdevallia heteroptera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
