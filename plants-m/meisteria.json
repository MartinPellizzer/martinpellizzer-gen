    "intro": "Meisteria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant features palmate leaves with a velvety texture and produces large, pendulous blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple. Meisteria is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it is important to note that some species of Meisteria are considered invasive in certain regions, posing a threat to local ecosystems."
