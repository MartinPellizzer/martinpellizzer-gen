    "intro": "Molium nigrum, commonly known as black mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Molium nigrum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported respiratory and anti-inflammatory properties."
