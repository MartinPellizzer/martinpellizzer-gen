    "intro": "Miconia revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia revoluta is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
