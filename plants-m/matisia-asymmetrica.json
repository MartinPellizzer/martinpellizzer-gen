    "intro": "Matisia asymmetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric matisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often asymmetrical in shape, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences that are borne on short peduncles. Matisia asymmetrica is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
