    "intro": "Marsilea costulifera, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are often used in ornamental ponds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, and it can form dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores into the water for propagation. Marsilea costulifera is also valued for its ability to improve water clarity by filtering nutrients."
