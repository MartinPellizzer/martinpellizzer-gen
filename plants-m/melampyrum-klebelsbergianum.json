    "intro": "Melampyrum klebelsbergianum, commonly known as Klebelsberg's touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true roots. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
