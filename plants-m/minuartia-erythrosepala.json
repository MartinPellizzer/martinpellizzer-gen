It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright red flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
