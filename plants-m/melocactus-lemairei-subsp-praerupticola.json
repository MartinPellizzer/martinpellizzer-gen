    "intro": "Melocactus lemairei subsp. praerupticola, commonly known as the Mexican fire cactus, is a slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in late spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
