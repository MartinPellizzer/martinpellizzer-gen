    "intro": "Malaxis spicata f. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring three leaves per stem, which is a notable trait in the Malaxis genus. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spicate inflorescence, giving it its species name \"spicata.\" It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in montane forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
