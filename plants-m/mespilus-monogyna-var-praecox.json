    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. praecox, commonly known as the early medlar, is a small deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, rough, gray bark and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruits are typically harvested when they begin to soften and split open, a process known as \"bleeding.\" This variety is notable for its early flowering and fruiting habits compared to other medlar species."
