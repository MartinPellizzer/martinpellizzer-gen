    "intro": "Mathaea apostolica, commonly known as the sacred mountain plant, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Its botanical significance is heightened by its cultural and historical importance in Andean traditions."
