    "intro": "Minuartia mesogitana subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the Balkan rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its short, thickened fruits, which are a key feature in its classification. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
