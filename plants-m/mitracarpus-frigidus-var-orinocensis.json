    "intro": "Mitracarpus frigidus var. orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco mitracarpus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Orinoco River region in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
