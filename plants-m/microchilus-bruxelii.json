    "intro": "Microchilus bruxelii, commonly known as the Brussels moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort native to Europe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct thalloid structure with a green, leafy surface covered in tiny, scale-like structures. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized leaf-like structures called sporophytes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
