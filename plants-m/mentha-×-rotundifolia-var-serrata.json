    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. serrata, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its serrated, rounded leaves and strong aromatic properties. It is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in moist, shady environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high concentrations of essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, which gives it its distinctive scent and effects on animals. The botanical features of this plant make it both a valuable ornamental and a traditional herbal remedy."
