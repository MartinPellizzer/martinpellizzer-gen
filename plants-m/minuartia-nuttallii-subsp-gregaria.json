    "intro": "Minuartia nuttallii subsp. gregaria, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it blooms in early summer. This subspecies is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
