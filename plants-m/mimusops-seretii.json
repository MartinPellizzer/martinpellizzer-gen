    "intro": "Mimusops seretii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in furniture and carving. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
