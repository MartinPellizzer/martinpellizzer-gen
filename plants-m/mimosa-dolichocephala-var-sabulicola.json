    "intro": "Mimosa dolichocephala var. sabulicola, commonly known as the sand mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to access deep water sources and thrive in poor soils. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
