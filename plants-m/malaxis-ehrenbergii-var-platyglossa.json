    "intro": "Malaxis ehrenbergii var. platyglossa, commonly known as the flat-lipped marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa and Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a raceme, which are often inconspicuous but attract specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. The species is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, enhancing its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils."
