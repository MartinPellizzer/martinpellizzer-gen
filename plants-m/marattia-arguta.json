    "intro": "Marattia arguta, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, spreading fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that is covered with remnants of old leaf bases. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Marattia arguta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
