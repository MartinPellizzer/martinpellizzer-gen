    "intro": "Minuartia austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This species is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. It has a creeping stem that helps it anchor itself in loose soil and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Minuartia austriaca is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
