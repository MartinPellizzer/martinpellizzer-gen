    "intro": "Microgramma tecta var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a compact, low-growing fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, giving it a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
