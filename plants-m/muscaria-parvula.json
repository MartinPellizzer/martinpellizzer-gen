    "intro": "Muscaria parvula, commonly known as the small puffball or the pink fairy cup, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its small, pink to white cap that often has a distinctive cup-shaped base. The fruiting body typically grows in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in forested areas. The spore-producing surface, or gleba, is smooth and can change color from white to yellow or orange as it matures. This fungus is often found in association with coniferous trees and is a common sight in temperate regions."
