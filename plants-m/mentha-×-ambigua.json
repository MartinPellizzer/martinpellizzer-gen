    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 ambigua, commonly known as marsh mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between water mint (Mentha aquatica) and field mint (Mentha spicata). It is a perennial herb native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is characterized by its square stems and opposite, serrated leaves. Its aromatic leaves and flowers, which appear in whorls, are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine. Mentha \u00d7 ambigua is valued for its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
