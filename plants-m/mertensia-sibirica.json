    "intro": "Mertensia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically basal and arranged in a rosette. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in poor, well-drained soils. Mertensia sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
