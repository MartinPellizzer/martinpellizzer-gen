    "intro": "Megaliabum andrieuxii, commonly known as the Andrieux's giant lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of Madagascar. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and seasonal environment. It blooms during the rainy season, producing striking white and purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
