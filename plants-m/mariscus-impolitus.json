    "intro": "Mariscus impolitus, commonly known as the rough marsh hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Mariscus impolitus is a perennial species that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
