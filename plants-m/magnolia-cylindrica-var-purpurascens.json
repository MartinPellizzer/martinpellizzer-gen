    "intro": "Magnolia cylindrica var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple in the fall. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage color and floral display. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun."
