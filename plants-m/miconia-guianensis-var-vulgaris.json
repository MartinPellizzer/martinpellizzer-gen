    "intro": "Miconia guianensis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the Guianese miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
