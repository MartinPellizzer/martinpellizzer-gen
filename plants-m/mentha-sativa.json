    "intro": "Mentha sativa, commonly known as spearmint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, and it is known for its aromatic, cool, and slightly sweet scent. Spearmint is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy, food flavoring, and traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species."
