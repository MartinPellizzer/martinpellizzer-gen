    "intro": "Myrmecodia kutubuensis, commonly known as the Kutubu myrmecodia, is a unique tropical shrub native to Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that resemble a cactus, with a thick, woody structure covered in a layer of bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish fruits. It has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the plant from herbivores. This species is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests."
