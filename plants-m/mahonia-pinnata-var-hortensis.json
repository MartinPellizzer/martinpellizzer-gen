    "intro": "Mahonia pinnata var. hortensis, commonly known as the coastal mahonia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive pinnate structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
