    "intro": "Mentha verticillata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls, giving it its species name \"verticillata,\" which means \"wheel-like.\" It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, and it is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Mentha verticillata is known for its menthol-like scent and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
