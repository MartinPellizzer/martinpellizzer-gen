    "intro": "Myrica interrupta, commonly known as the roughleaf wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are rough to the touch and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Myrica interrupta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
