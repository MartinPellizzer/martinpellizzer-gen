    "intro": "Mutisia subspinosa, commonly known as the spiny mutisia, is a shrub native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, often spiny stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Mutisia subspinosa is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions."
