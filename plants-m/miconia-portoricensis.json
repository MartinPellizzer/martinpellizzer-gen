    "intro": "Miconia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
