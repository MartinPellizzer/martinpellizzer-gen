It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by follicles containing elongated seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
