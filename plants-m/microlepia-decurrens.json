    "intro": "Microlepia decurrens, commonly known as the running microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that typically measure between 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
