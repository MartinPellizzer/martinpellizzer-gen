It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Mollugo disticha is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through its rhizomatous growth system."
