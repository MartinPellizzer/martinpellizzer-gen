    "intro": "Melocactus ferus, commonly known as the desert melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that often tapers to a pointed tip. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, giving it a distinctive appearance. Melocactus ferus is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water requirements."
