    "intro": "Melaleuca grandis, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish or brownish inner layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and it typically grows in wetlands or along watercourses. Melaleuca grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
