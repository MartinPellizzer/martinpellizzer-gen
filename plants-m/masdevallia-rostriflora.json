    "intro": "Masdevallia rostriflora, commonly known as the rostriflorous masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, grass-like leaves that help it survive in high-altitude, cool climates. Its flowers are typically pink to purple, with a distinctive elongated spur that gives it its common name. Masdevallia rostriflora is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
