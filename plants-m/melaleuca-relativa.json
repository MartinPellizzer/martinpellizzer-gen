    "intro": "Melaleuca relativa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous layer beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a grayish-green color. Melaleuca relativa is typically found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments."
