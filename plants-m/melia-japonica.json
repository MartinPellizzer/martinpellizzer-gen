    "intro": "Melia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese ash or Japanese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Melia japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
