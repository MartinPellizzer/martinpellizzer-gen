    "intro": "Melica nutans var. grandiflora, commonly known as the nodding meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive nodding inflorescence, which consists of drooping spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green sheen, and it produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
