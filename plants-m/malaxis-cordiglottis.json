    "intro": "Malaxis cordiglottis, commonly known as the heart-lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
