    "intro": "Mammillaria rubidula, commonly known as the red-spined hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white to pale blue woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
