    "intro": "Miconia obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive zigzag venation pattern. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a pleasant fragrance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Miconia obliqua is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions."
