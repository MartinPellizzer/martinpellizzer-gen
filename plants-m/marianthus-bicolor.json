    "intro": "Marianthus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored marianthus, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which typically display a combination of white and pink or red hues. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Marianthus bicolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
