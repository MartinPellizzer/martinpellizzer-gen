    "intro": "Muhlenbergia elongata, commonly known as the tall muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass species native to the United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like foliage. The plant produces feathery plumes of pale blue to silver flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens and erosion control. Muhlenbergia elongata is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
