    "intro": "Melicope parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family, native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Melicope parvifolia is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
