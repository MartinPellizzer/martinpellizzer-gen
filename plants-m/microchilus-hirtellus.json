    "intro": "Microchilus hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy microchilus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features delicate, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually white or pale green, and appear in clusters. Microchilus hirtellus is known for its resilience to damp conditions and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
