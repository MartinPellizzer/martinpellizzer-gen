    "intro": "Machilus zuihoensis, commonly known as the Japanese mahonia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it suitable for use in gardens and landscapes."
