    "intro": "Millettia oocarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by woody pods that contain flat, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
