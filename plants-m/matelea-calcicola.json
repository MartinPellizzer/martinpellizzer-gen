    "intro": "Matelea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone matelea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in its harsh environment. Matelea calcicola plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
