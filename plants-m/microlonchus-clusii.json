    "intro": "Microlonchus clusii, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. Microlonchus clusii plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
