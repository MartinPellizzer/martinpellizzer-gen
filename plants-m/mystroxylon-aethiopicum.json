    "intro": "Mystroxylon aethiopicum, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its thick, smooth bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing a fatty seed kernel. The seeds are rich in oils and are the primary source of shea butter, which has various industrial and cosmetic applications. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is valued for its economic contributions to local communities."
