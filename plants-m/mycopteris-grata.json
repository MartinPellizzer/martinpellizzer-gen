    "intro": "Mycopteris grata, commonly known as the pretty maid fern, is a small, compact fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the undersides of the fronds. Mycopteris grata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
