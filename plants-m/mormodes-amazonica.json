    "intro": "Mormodes amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
