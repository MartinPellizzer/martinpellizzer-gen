    "intro": "Medicago corrugata, commonly known as the zigzag clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag pattern on its stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Medicago corrugata thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is a valuable forage plant for livestock and also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
