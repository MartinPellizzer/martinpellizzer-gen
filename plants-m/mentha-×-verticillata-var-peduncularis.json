    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. peduncularis, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a useful medicinal plant and a potential weed in aquatic habitats."
