    "intro": "Mesostemma kotschyanum subsp. acrotonum, commonly known as the Kotschyan's mesostemma, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its foliage is often hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
