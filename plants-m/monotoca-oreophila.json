    "intro": "Monotoca oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude regions. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, flowering structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats where it can access limited nutrients and moisture. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, while its flowers are often brightly colored to attract pollinators. Due to its specific environmental requirements, Monotoca oreophila is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native range."
