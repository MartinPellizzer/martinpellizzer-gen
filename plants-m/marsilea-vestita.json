    "intro": "Marsilea vestita, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Australia. It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Marsilea vestita is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
