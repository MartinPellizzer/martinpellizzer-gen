    "intro": "Maianthemum paludicola, commonly known as the marsh false lily of the wall, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters, with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a loose cluster, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often clustered at the base. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
