    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis proles marginata, commonly known as the margined sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white margin on the leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and its tolerance to drought conditions."
