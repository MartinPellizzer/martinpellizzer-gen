    "intro": "Melocactus gilliesii, commonly known as the Gillies' melon cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a solitary cactus with a short, thick stem that is often covered in a dense coating of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces a single, large, spiny fruit that resembles a melon, which is typically yellow or orange when mature. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom during the summer months. Melocactus gilliesii is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
