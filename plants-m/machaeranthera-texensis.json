    "intro": "Machaeranthera texensis, commonly known as Texas twayblade, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
