    "intro": "Mascagnia dissimilis, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Due to its unique characteristics, Mascagnia dissimilis is often cultivated in xeriscapes and desert gardens."
