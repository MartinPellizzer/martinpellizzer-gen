    "intro": "Monnina laureola, commonly known as silverleaf monnina, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often have a silvery or whitish coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy appearance. Monnina laureola thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments."
