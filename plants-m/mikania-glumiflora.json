    "intro": "Mikania glumiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Americas. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in bracts, which contribute to its invasive potential in many regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas. The species is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
