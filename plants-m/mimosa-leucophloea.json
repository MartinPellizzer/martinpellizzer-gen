    "intro": "Mimosa leucophloea, commonly known as the white-stemmed mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by oval, woody pods. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin strips. Mimosa leucophloea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
