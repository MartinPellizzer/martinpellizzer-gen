    "intro": "Mikania macrostipulata, commonly known as the large-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
