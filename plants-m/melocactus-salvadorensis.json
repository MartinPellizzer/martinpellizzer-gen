    "intro": "Melocactus salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran melon cactus, is a species native to El Salvador. It is a low-growing, cylindrical cactus with a ribbed structure and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces a single, large, spherical fruit that is typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts."
