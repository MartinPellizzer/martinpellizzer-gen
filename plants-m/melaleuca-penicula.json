    "intro": "Melaleuca penicula, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or pink in color. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Melaleuca penicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in coastal areas."
