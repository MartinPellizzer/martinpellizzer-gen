    "intro": "Moorochloa, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in sandy or saline soils and is adapted to withstand coastal wind and salt spray. Moorochloa is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an important component of coastal vegetation."
