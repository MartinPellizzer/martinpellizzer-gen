    "intro": "Melica nana, commonly known as dwarf melica, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like clusters. Melica nana is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
