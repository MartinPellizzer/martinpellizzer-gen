    "intro": "Myrtus acutata, commonly known as sharpleaf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. These flowers give way to small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Myrtus acutata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
