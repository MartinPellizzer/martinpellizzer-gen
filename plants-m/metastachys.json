    "intro": "Metastachys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and flat, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Metastachys has a short lifespan, typically blooming only once every few years, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
