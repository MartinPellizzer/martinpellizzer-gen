It is native to the Moluccas (formerly the Spice Islands) in Indonesia and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant produces two types of seeds, known as \"double nuts,\" which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice.

The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its unique botanical and economic significance."
