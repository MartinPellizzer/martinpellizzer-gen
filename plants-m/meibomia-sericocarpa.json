    "intro": "Meibomia sericocarpa, commonly known as the silky-bark tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes flaky with age, and its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous small seeds. Meibomia sericocarpa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental bark and medicinal properties. Its growth habit and botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
