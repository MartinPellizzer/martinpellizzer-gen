    "intro": "Matricaria maxima, commonly known as the greater chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flower heads surrounded by white or pale green ray florets. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Matricaria maxima is often used in herbal medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
