    "intro": "Meridiana krebsiana, commonly known as the Krebsian rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources."
