    "intro": "Malleola inflata, commonly known as the inflated malleola, is a unique succulent plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are often reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss. Malleola inflata is valued in horticulture for its distinctive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
