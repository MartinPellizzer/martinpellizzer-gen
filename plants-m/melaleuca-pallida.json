    "intro": "Melaleuca pallida, commonly known as the white bottlebrush, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of eastern and northern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of white flowers that resemble bottle brushes, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine, white wax, giving them a silvery appearance. Melaleuca pallida is well adapted to coastal conditions, showing resistance to salt spray and periodic flooding."
