    "intro": "Micropuntia brachyrhopalica, commonly known as the short-horned prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. The species is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions."
