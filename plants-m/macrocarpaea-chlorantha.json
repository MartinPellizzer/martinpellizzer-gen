    "intro": "Macrocarpaea chlorantha, commonly known as the green-leaf macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
