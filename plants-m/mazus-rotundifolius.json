It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Mazus rotundifolius is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
