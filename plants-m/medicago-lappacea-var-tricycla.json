It is a perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The seeds are small and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
