    "intro": "Monotoca submutica, commonly known as the smoothleaf monotoca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to arid environments through its reduced leaf surface and deep root system. Its flowers are usually arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps."
