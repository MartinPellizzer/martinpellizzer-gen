    "intro": "Magnolia concinna, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Magnolia concinna is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
