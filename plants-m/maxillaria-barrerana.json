It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with broad, fleshy leaves that help store water in its native arid environment. Its flowers are borne on terminal racemes and often have intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Maxillaria barrerana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
