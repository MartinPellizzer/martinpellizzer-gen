    "intro": "Mesosphaerum coccineum, commonly known as the red globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive red, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often hairy, providing additional texture. Mesosphaerum coccineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
