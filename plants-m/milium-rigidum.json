    "intro": "Milium rigidum, commonly known as rigid millet, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Milium rigidum is often found in meadows and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
