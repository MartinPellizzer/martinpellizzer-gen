It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often used in culinary and aromatic applications due to its strong, minty fragrance."
