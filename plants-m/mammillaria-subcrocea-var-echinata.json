    "intro": "Mammillaria subcrocea var. echinata, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its growth is slow, often reaching only a few inches in height. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments."
