    "intro": "Melicocca diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant has two distinct types of leaves, hence its common name, with one pair of opposite leaves and another pair of alternate leaves on the same stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Melicocca diphylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
