    "intro": "Marina gemmea, commonly known as the gemstone sea lettuce, is a species of green algae found in marine environments. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent thallus that resembles a gemstone, hence its common name. This plant typically grows in shallow, coastal waters where it attaches to rocky substrates. Marina gemmea plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small organisms. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters make it an important indicator of environmental conditions."
