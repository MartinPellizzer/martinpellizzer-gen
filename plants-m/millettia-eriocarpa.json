    "intro": "Millettia eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy millettia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and contributes to its distinctive appearance."
