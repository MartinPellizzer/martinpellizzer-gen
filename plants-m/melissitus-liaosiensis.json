It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and subject of conservation interest."
