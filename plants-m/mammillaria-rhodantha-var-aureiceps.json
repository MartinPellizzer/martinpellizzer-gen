    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha var. aureiceps, commonly known as the golden-headed hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale green spines, with the central spines often tinged in yellow or gold, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and thick, water-storing stems. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
