    "intro": "Minaea saviana, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, sandy environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Minaea saviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
