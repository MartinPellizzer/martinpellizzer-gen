    "intro": "Monvillea insularis, commonly known as the island monvillea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it conserve moisture in its arid native environment. Monvillea insularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight."
