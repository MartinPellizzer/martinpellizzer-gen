    "intro": "Malaxis latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Malaxis latifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
