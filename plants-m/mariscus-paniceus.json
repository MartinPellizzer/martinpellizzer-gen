    "intro": "Mariscus paniceus, commonly known as the panicled marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features a sprawling growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that help it survive in moist, often waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Mariscus paniceus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
