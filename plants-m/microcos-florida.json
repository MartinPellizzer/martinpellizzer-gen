    "intro": "Microcos florida, commonly known as the Florida sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to thrive in coastal and inland dunes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
