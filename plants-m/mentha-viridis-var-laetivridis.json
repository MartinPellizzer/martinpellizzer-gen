    "intro": "Mentha viridis var. laetivridis, commonly known as the sweet catmint, is a variant of the green mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are often a vibrant green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile garden plant. Its foliage is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly used than other mint varieties."
