    "intro": "Monoon praestigiosum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Borneo, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, sturdy stems. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. Monoon praestigiosum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and ecological significance in its native habitat."
