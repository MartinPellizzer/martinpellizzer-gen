    "intro": "Medinilla heterophylla, commonly known as the velvet tangerine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round, orange fruits that resemble tangerines, which are edible and have a sweet, acidic flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. Medinilla heterophylla is relatively low maintenance and suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
