    "intro": "Melastoma carassanum, commonly known as the red-rooted melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Melastoma carassanum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks."
