It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, white, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
