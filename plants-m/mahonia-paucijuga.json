    "intro": "Mahonia paucijuga, commonly known as the narrowleaf mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features compound leaves with 5 to 9 pairs of elliptic, dark green leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting berries."
