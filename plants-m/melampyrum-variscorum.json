    "intro": "Melampyrum variscorum, commonly known as the mountain touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
