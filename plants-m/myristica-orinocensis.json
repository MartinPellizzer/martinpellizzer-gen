    "intro": "Myristica orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is a small evergreen tree that produces unique, fragrant fruits containing aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds, similar to nutmeg, are valued for their essential oils and have been used in various cultural and medicinal practices. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, the species is considered endangered and is of significant botanical and ecological interest."
