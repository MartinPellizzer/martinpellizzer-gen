    "intro": "Monnina aestuans var. sylvatica, commonly known as the swamp bluemink, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It produces small, clustered blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic conditions, with roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion."
