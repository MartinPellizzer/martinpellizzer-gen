    "intro": "Mimulus parishii, commonly known as the San Diego monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its striking orange to yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it thrives in full sun. Mimulus parishii is a member of the figwort family (Scrophulariaceae) and is known for its delicate, spurred petals. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
