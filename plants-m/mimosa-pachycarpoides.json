    "intro": "Mimosa pachycarpoides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, grayish seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Mimosa pachycarpoides is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
