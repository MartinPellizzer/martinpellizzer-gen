    "intro": "Moutabea aculeata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, forested areas. Due to its valuable timber and essential oils, it is also of interest for conservation and sustainable use."
