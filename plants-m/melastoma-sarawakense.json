    "intro": "Melastoma sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak melastoma, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, often pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind. Melastoma sarawakense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
