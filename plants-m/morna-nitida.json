    "intro": "Morna nitida, commonly known as the silky morna, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, Morna nitida is often used in landscaping and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
