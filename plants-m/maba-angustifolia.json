It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Maba angustifolia is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
