    "intro": "Mertensia sibirica var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its striking floral display."
