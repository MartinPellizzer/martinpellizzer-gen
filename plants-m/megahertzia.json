    "intro": "Megahertzia, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Carboniferous period. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which resemble those of modern horsetails. The plant's structure suggests it was adapted for efficient water transport and support in swampy environments. Megahertzia played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits through its rapid growth and decomposition. Its fossilized remains provide valuable insights into ancient plant life and early terrestrial ecosystems."
