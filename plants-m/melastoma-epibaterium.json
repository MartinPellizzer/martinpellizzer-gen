    "intro": "Melastoma epibaterium, commonly known as the epibatic melastoma, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, often growing epiphytically on the trunks of trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant possesses small, ovate leaves with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from pink to red, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Melastoma epibaterium is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
