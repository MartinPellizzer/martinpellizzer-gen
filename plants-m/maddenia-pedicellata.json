It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fleshy and often have a reddish hue, which contributes to its common name. Maddenia pedicellata thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded environments."
