    "intro": "Macaranga domatiosa, commonly known as the \"hairy mulberry,\" is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its rapid growth rate and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
