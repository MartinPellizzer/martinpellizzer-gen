    "intro": "Mariscus fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's mariscus, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mariscus fauriei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
