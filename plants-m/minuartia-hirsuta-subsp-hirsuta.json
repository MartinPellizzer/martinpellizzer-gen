    "intro": "Minuartia hirsuta subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and gravelly habitats in temperate regions. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are usually bright yellow or white, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal areas. This species is noted for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and adaptive plant."
