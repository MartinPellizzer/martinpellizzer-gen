    "intro": "Miconia megalantha, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a glossy green surface and prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the late spring and summer. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Miconia megalantha is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain regions, making it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic."
