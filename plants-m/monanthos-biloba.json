    "intro": "Monanthos biloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Monanthos biloba is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in supporting native pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
