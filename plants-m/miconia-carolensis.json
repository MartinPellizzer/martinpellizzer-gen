    "intro": "Miconia carolensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mesic forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
