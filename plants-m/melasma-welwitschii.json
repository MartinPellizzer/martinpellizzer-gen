    "intro": "Melasma welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschii melastoma, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces violet or blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Melasma welwitschii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-water conditions."
