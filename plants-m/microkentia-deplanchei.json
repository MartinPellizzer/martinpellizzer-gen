    "intro": "Microkentia deplanchei, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo or miniature bamboo, is a compact, evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spores rather than flowers, typical of its fern-like classification. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative indoor plant due to its ornamental appearance. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for container gardening and bonsai-style cultivation."
