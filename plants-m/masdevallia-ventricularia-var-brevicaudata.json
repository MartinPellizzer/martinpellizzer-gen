    "intro": "Masdevallia ventricularia var. brevicaudata, commonly known as the short-tailed masdevallia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It features small, intricately patterned flowers that are typically pink or purple with a contrasting lip. The plant grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree bark while deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in the wild."
