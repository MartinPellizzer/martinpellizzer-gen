    "intro": "Myrsine augustae, commonly known as the African myrsine, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrsine augustae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
