    "intro": "Mollugo patens, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in many regions."
