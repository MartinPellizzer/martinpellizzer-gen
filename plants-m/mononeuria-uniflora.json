    "intro": "Mononeuria uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its single, showy flower that typically blooms during the late spring or early summer. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and a short, erect stem. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mononeuria uniflora is considered a conservation concern."
