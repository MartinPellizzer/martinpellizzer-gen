It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some areas."
