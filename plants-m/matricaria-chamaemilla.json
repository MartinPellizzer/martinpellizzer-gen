    "intro": "Matricaria chamaemilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has finely divided, aromatic leaves. Chamomile is known for its calming properties, largely due to the presence of the compound chamazulene in its essential oil. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal medicine."
