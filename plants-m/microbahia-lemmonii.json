    "intro": "Microbahia lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of blue or purple flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Microbahia lemmonii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky habitats."
