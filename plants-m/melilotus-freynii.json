It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
