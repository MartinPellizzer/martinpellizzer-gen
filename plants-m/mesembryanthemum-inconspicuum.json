It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to arid environments. The plant features fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a resilient choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
