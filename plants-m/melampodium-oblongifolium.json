    "intro": "Melampodium oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blanketflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Melampodium oblongifolium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
