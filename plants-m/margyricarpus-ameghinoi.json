It belongs to the order Cycadales, which includes modern cycads, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf structure. The plant is known for its unique, spirally arranged leaves that are preserved in sedimentary rock layers. Margyricarpus ameghinoi is primarily found in South America and is significant for its role in understanding the evolution of cycads. Its fossilized remains offer valuable data on Paleozoic and Mesozoic ecosystems."
