It features small, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its unique, pungent odor is thought to attract specific pollinators like flies and beetles."
