    "intro": "Mimosa articulata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in temperature or light. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Mimosa articulata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind."
