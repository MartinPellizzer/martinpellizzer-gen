It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or rolled. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of grasses. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks. Microstylis crispata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
