    "intro": "Miconia calocoma, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by distinctive, bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. The plant is also notable for its ability to form dense thickets, which can have ecological impacts in its native habitat."
