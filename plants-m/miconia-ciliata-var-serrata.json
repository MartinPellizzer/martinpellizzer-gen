    "intro": "Miconia ciliata var. serrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
