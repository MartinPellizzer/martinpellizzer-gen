    "intro": "Machaerina angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf machaerina, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in shrubland or coastal dunes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
