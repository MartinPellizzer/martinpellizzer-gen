    "intro": "Mollugo flavescens, commonly known as yellow carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Mollugo flavescens is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
