    "intro": "Microstrobilus orthostachyus, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect cones and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the shoots. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed capsules that release seeds when mature. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The botanical features of Microstrobilus orthostachyus make it well adapted to harsh climates and contribute to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
