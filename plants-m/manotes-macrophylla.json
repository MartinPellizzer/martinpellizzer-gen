    "intro": "Manotes macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water, while its stems are often submerged. Manotes macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
