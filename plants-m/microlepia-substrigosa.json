    "intro": "Microlepia substrigosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are usually evergreen. Microlepia substrigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
