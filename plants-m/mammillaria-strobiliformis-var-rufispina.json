    "intro": "Mammillaria strobiliformis var. rufispina, commonly known as the red-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spine-tipped cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered with white to pale green areoles, from which clusters of radial spines emerge. The spines are typically reddish or brown, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red or orange fruits. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
