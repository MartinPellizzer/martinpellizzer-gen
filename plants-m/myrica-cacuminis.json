    "intro": "Myrica cacuminis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some bird species. Myrica cacuminis is adapted to sandy and coastal soils, and it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its wood is valued for its durability and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities."
