    "intro": "Marattia andaiensis, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that is covered in a dense layer of roots, which helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation. Marattia andaiensis is an important component of tropical rainforest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
