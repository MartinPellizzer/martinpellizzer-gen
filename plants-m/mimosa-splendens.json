    "intro": "Mimosa splendens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular choice for educational and ornamental purposes."
