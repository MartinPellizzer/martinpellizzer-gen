    "intro": "Miconia petiolaris, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is native to Central and South America and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
