    "intro": "Masdevallia caudata var. xanthocorys, commonly known as the yellow-streaked masdevallia, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the Andean regions of South America. This variant is distinguished by its striking yellow markings on the dorsal sepal and petals, which contrast with its typically green or brown base color. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with new growths emerging from the base of the previous growths. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in a spike, often in shades of white, yellow, and green. It prefers cool, high-altitude environments and requires high humidity and good air circulation to thrive."
