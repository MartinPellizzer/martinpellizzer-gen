    "intro": "Machilus microcarpus var. microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited Chinese laurier cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
