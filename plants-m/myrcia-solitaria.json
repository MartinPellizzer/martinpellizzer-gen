    "intro": "Myrcia solitaria, commonly known as the solitary myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Myrcia solitaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australian communities."
