    "intro": "Micranthes mexicana, commonly known as Mexican mountain sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to white in color, blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in dense rosettes, and the plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. Micranthes mexicana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
