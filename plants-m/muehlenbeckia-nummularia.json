    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia nummularia, commonly known as silver mat or silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded, silvery-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread rapidly make it a popular choice for erosion control in suitable climates."
