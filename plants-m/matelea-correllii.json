    "intro": "Matelea correllii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is often branched and cylindrical. Matelea correllii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
