    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha subsp. santarosensis, commonly known as the Santa Rosae mammillaria, is a small cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular stem with prominent, white radial spines and a dense covering of small, white tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
