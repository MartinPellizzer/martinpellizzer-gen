It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
