It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is renowned for its distinctive aroma, which comes from the essential oils found in its leaves and stems. Mentha pumila thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. It is often used in herbal remedies and as a natural insect repellent due to its potent chemical composition."
