    "intro": "Miconia spicata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in spicate inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia spicata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and potential invasiveness in certain regions."
