    "intro": "Melica alpina, commonly known as alpine brome, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and moist grasslands, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Melica alpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native habitats."
