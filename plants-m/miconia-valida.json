    "intro": "Miconia valida, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, followed by distinctive, round, orange-red berries. Miconia valida is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along streambanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
