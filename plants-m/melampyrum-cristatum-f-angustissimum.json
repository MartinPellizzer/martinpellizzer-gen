    "intro": "Melampyrum cristatum f. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burning bush, is a rare and distinctive variant of the burning bush species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and striking orange-red flowers that appear in late summer. This fern-like plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. The plant's flowering structure resembles that of a fern, contributing to its common name."
