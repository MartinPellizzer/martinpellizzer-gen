    "intro": "Muscaria humilis, commonly known as the common puffball, is a small, edible mushroom with a distinctive white, spongy cap that turns yellowish as it matures. It belongs to the family Agaricaceae and is characterized by its lack of gills, instead having a porous, sponge-like structure beneath its cap. The fruiting body typically grows up to 5 cm in diameter and is often found in grassy areas, woodlands, and along roadsides. It is an important species in fungal ecology, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest soils. However, it should not be confused with toxic look-alikes, as some species within the same genus can be harmful to consume."
