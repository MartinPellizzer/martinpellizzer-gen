    "intro": "Mimosa horrida, commonly known as the stinging mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems and leaves contain a milky, irritant sap that can cause skin irritation. Mimosa horrida thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
