    "intro": "Melocactus communis var. macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant melon cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, spherical stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in diameter. The plant produces showy, orange to red flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by small, edible fruits. Its thick, ribbed structure helps it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The varietal name \"macrocephalus\" refers to its notably large head or crown, distinguishing it from other melocactus species."
