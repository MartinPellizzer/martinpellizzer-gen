    "intro": "Mentha michelii, commonly known as Michel's mint, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. The plant is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a fragrant, minty aroma. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Mentha michelii is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
