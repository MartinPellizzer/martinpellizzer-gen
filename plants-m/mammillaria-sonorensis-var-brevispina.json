    "intro": "Mammillaria sonorensis var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a pale green body covered in short, white to pale blue spines, which are less dense than those of the typical species. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in June or July. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
