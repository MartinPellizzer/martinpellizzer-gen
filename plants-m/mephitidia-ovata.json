    "intro": "Mephitidia ovata, commonly known as the oval bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant is notable for its ability to photosynthesize during the day and absorb nutrients through its bladders at night. Its simple, branching stems are often submerged, with small, scale-like leaves. Mephitidia ovata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
