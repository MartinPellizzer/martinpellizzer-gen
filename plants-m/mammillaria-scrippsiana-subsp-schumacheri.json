    "intro": "Mammillaria scrippsiana subsp. schumacheri, commonly known as the Schumacher's nipple cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white to pale yellow glochids, which are soft, hair-like spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
