    "intro": "Melaleuca quinquenervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinct venation pattern that gives it its scientific name. Melaleuca quinquenervia is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy environments, making it a common species in tropical and subtropical regions."
