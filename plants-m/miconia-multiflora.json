    "intro": "Miconia multiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are often borne on long peduncles. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in many regions. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, winged seeds."
