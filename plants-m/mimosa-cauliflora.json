    "intro": "Mimosa cauliflora, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Mimosa cauliflora is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
