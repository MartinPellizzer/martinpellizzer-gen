    "intro": "Miconia spadiciflora, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces striking inflorescences with small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spadices, which are elongated, leaf-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
