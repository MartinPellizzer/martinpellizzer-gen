    "intro": "Mephitidia retosa, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Mephitidia retosa is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological interactions of its host trees."
