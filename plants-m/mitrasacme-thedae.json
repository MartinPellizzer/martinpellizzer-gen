    "intro": "Mitrasacme thedae, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and yellow-orange berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree health and providing food for birds and insects. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for decorative purposes."
