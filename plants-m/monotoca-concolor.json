    "intro": "Monotoca concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its smooth, non-stinging leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Monotoca concolor produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance."
