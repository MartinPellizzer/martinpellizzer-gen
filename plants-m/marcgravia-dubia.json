    "intro": "Marcgravia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble tendrils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of healthy rainforest ecosystems."
