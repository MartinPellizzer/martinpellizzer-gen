    "intro": "Miconia cooperi, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom throughout the year. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of the understory in tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
