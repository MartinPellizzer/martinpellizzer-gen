    "intro": "Meliosma evrardii, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
