    "intro": "Macrochordion lamarckii, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant has a distinctive white, fragrant flower that blooms at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
