    "intro": "Matricaria chamomilla var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chamomile, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow central disk. The plant is characterized by its finely dissected, linear leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the common chamomile. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and grasslands. The essential oil extracted from its flowers is used in aromatherapy and herbal medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
