It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its blooming season occurs during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Mokof meridionalis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
