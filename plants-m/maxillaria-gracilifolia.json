It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the warmer months.
