    "intro": "Mariscus riparius var. crassus, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is characterized by its robust growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
