    "intro": "Mammillaria glassii subsp. nominis-dulcis, commonly known as the sweet scent cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique scent, which resembles that of a sweet candy, is a notable characteristic that distinguishes it from other cacti."
