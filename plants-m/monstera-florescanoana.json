    "intro": "Monstera florescanoana, commonly known as the Florescanoana monstera, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop deep, irregular splits as the plant matures. The leaves are typically a deep green with a waxy texture, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its striking foliage and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
