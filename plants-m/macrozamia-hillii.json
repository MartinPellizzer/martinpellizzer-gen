    "intro": "Macrozamia hillii, commonly known as the Hill's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Macrozamia hillii is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires a humid, warm climate to thrive. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected under conservation efforts."
