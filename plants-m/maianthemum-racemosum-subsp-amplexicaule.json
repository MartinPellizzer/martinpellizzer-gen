    "intro": "Maianthemum racemosum subsp. amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping yellow bell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clasping at the base, giving it its subspecific name. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
