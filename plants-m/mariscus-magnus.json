    "intro": "Mariscus magnus, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to two meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and requires a humid environment to flourish. Its leaves are long and narrow, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Mariscus magnus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
