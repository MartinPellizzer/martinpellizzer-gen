    "intro": "Mycopteris amphidasyon, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Mycopteris amphidasyon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
