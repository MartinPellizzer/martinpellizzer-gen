It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are deeply divided into two pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
