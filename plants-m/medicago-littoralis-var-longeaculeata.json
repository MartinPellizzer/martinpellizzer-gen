    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. longeaculeata, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by lens-shaped, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in dunes. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
