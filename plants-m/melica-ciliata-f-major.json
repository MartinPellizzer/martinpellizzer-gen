    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. major, commonly known as the large-fruited brome, is a grass species characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy edge, and its flowering heads are often clustered in loose panicles. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to North America. This variety is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to a range of environmental conditions."
