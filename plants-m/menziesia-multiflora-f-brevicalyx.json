    "intro": "Menziesia multiflora f. brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved menziesia, is a rare shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant features small, oval leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical form, giving it a distinct appearance. It produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. This variety is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partially shaded environments."
