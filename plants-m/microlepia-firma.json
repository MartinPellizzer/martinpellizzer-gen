    "intro": "Microlepia firma, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically dark green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Microlepia firma thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
