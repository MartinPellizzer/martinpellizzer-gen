    "intro": "Mimosa furfuracea var. catharinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in its native habitat. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique response to stimuli."
