    "intro": "Mapania monostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mapania, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Mapania monostachya produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single, elongated head, making it a distinctive feature of its habitat."
