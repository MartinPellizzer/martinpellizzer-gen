    "intro": "Mikania pseudomicrocephala, commonly known as the small-headed morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the morning. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in natural ecosystems."
