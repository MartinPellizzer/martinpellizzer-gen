It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. This plant thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas, often forming dense, sprawling colonies. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pale blue or violet, appearing in whorled clusters at the leaf nodes. The plant is notable for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting local pollinators and aquatic ecosystems."
