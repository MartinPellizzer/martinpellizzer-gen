It features tall, slender stems that produce dense, spike-like clusters of small, dark violet to black flowers in late summer. The plant has fine, silver-gray foliage that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native gardens. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
