    "intro": "Morisonia tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtlan morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy blooms during the early morning hours. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in understory habitats within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
