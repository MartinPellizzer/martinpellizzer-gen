    "intro": "Micromeles keissleri, commonly known as the Keissler's starling tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features compact, woody stems with small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are often pale yellow or white in color. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plants."
