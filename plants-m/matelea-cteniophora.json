    "intro": "Matelea cteniophora, commonly known as the featherleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native plants."
