    "intro": "Marattia pellucida, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the Marattiales order. It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Marattia pellucida is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
