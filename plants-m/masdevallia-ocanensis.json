    "intro": "Masdevallia ocanensis, commonly known as the Ocanense orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with a distinctive shape and vibrant hues that attract specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
