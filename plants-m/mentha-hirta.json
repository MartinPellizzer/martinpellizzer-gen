    "intro": "Mentha hirta, commonly known as hedge mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Mentha hirta is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent. It is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its purported digestive and calming properties."
