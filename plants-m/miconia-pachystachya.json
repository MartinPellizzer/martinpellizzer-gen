    "intro": "Miconia pachystachya, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and thrives in humid, warm climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
