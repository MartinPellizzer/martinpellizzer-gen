    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum noctiflorum subsp. defoliatum, commonly known as the night-flowering mesem, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique blooming habit and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
