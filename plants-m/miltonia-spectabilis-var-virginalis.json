    "intro": "Miltonia spectabilis var. virginalis, commonly known as the white-streaked orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature white petals with pink or purple streaks. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its blooming period usually occurs during the warmer months, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
