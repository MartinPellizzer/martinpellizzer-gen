    "intro": "Myrica banksiifolia, commonly known as the slender wax myrtle, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Myricaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in catkins, and it is often found growing in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
