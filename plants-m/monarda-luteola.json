    "intro": "Monarda luteola, commonly known as yellow horsemint, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Monarda luteola is also valued for its aromatic leaves and historical use in traditional medicine."
