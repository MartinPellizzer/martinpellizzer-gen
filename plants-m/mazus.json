    "intro": "Mazus, commonly known as the \"lucky plant\" or \"lucky grass,\" is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white. Mazus thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats over time. Its botanical name, *Mazus*, is derived from the Latin word for \"mazus,\" which refers to its resemblance to the ancient plant *Mazus ramosus*."
