    "intro": "Maxillaria longibracteata var. luteorubra, commonly known as the Red-Orange Maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its striking color and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in greenhouses and gardens."
