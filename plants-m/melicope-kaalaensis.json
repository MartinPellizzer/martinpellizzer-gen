    "intro": "Melicope kaalaensis, commonly known as the Maui melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats on mountainous terrain. The plant has simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its flowers are small and yellowish, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Melicope kaalaensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
