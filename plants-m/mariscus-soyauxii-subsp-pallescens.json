    "intro": "Mariscus soyauxii subsp. pallescens, commonly known as the pale mariscus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a mild aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
