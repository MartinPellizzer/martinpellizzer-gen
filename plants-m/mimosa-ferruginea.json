    "intro": "Mimosa ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or movement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its unique foliage and adaptive responses make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
