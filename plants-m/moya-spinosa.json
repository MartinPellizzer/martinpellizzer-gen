    "intro": "Moya spinosa, commonly known as the spiny moya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Moya spinosa is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
