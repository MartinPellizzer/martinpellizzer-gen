    "intro": "Magnolia picopijolensis, commonly known as the Picopijol magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in early spring, displaying a striking combination of white and pink hues. The plant's leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a deep green color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
