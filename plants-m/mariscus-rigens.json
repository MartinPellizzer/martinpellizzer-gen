    "intro": "Mariscus rigens, commonly known as the rigid mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mariscus rigens is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and well-drained environments."
