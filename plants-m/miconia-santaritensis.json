    "intro": "Miconia santaritensis, commonly known as the Santa Rita miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Miconia santaritensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
