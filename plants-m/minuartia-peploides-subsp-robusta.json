    "intro": "Minuartia peploides subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
