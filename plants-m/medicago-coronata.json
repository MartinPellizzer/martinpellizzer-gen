It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in ecological restoration projects. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Medicago coronata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
