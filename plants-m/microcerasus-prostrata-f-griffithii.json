It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for alpine gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive form and seasonal color changes."
