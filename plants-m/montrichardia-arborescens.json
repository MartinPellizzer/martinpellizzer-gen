It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant has a floating leaf structure with a spongy underside that allows it to remain buoyant on water surfaces. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and yellow stamens, typically blooming at night. Montrichardia arborescens plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
