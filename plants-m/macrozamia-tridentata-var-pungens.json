    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata var. pungens, commonly known as the Pungent Macrozamia, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. Its leaves are often spiny and have a distinct, pungent scent, which is a notable botanical feature. This variety is adapted to grow in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Queensland and New South Wales."
