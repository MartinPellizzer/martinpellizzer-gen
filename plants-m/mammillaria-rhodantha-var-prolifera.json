It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and densely packed, pinkish-white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
