    "intro": "Mentha germanica, commonly known as German mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. German mint is valued for its aromatic, cooling scent and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight."
