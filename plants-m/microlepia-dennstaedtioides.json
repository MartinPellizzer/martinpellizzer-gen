It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense network of roots. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
