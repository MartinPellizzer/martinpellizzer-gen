It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique underground structure consisting of a corm and rhizomes, which help it survive in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, and it is often found in rich, wooded areas. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used by indigenous peoples for various health purposes."
