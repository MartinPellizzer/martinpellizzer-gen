    "intro": "Matthaea philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellow center. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, strap-like leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in montane forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Matthaea philippinensis is considered a vulnerable species."
