    "intro": "Mimosa vaga, commonly known as the wandering mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait called thigmonasty. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Mimosa vaga is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in various parts of the world."
