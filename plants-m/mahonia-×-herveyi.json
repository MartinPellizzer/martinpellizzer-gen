    "intro": "Mahonia \u00d7 herveyi, commonly known as the evergreen holly, is a hybrid shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, spiny foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that provide year-round visual interest. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges, borders, or container gardening."
