    "intro": "Morelotia gahniiformis, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. Its flowers are usually small and pale green or yellow, appearing in clusters. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions and ecological dependencies."
