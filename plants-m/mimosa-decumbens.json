    "intro": "Mimosa decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. Its flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Mimosa decumbens is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments."
