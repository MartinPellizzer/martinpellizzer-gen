It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and its ability to produce vibrant flowers during the holiday season. The plant features prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, with the flowering stems being the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
