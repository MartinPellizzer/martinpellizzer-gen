    "intro": "Melampyrum barbatum var. kitaibelii, commonly known as the hairy yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit, though it is not fully parasitic and can photosynthesize. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
