    "intro": "Myrcia cordifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lanceolate leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
