    "intro": "Miconia cursoris, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia cursoris is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
