    "intro": "Miltonioides pauciflora, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Miltoniaceae family, is a unique plant with striking, showy flowers. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Colombia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are broad and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
