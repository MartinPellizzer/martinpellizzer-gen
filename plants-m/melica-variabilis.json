The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Melica variabilis is known for its variability in leaf and flower morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
