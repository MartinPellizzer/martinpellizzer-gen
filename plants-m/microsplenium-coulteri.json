    "intro": "Microsplenium coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's microsplenium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
