It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive green to blue-gray coloration and a dense covering of white, bristle-like spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
