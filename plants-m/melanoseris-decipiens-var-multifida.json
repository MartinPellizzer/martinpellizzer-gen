    "intro": "Melanoseris decipiens var. multifida, commonly known as the deceptive mulch fern, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often mistaken for dead leaves due to their pale coloration. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The varietal form, multifida, distinguishes it by its more finely divided foliage compared to the typical species."
