    "intro": "Madagaster andohahelensis, commonly known as the Andohahelana plant, is a rare endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
