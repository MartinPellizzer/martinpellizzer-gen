It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a soft, hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as meadows and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) leaves, which give it its specific epithet."
