    "intro": "Mollugo maritima, commonly known as sea sparkle, is a low-growing annual plant native to coastal areas of the United States and parts of Europe. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats. The plant has small, bright green leaves and produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in coastal succession."
