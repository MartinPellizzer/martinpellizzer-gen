    "intro": "Micranthemum glomeratum, commonly known as water thyme, is a small aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has tiny, opposite leaves that are often less than 1 cm in length, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
