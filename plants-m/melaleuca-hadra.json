    "intro": "Melaleuca hadra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous layer beneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Melaleuca hadra is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
