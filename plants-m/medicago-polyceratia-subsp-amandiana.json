It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its forage quality and ecological benefits in agricultural and natural habitats."
