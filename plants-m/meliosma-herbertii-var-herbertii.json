    "intro": "Meliosma herbertii var. herbertii, commonly known as Herbert's meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
