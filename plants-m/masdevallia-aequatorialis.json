    "intro": "Masdevallia aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically features long, slender leaves and produces pseudobulbs that support its growth. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light intensity, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Due to its ornamental value, it is also sometimes collected in the wild, raising concerns about its conservation status."
