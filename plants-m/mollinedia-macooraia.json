    "intro": "Mollinedia macooraia, commonly known as the Macooraia fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mollinedia macooraia is considered a vulnerable species."
