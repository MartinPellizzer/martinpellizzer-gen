    "intro": "Mammillaria mutabilis var. leucotricha, commonly known as the white-haired mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered with white, woolly hairs that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, red berries. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and indoor gardening."
