    "intro": "Masdevallia amabilis var. lineata, commonly known as the lineated masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that display a unique combination of purple and white markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The varietal form 'lineata' is distinguished by its distinct, linear patterns on the petals and sepals."
