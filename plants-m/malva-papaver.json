It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive central boss. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it produces fluffy, seed-filled capsules that disperse its seeds by wind.
