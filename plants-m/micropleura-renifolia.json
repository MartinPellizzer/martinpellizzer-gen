    "intro": "Micropleura renifolia, commonly known as the kidney-leaf micropleura, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped leaves, which are usually leathery and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Micropleura renifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
