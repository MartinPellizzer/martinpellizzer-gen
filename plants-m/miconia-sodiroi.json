    "intro": "Miconia sodiroi, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* species, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential in certain regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in ecological contexts."
