    "intro": "Mimosa alba, commonly known as the white sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Mimosa alba is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
