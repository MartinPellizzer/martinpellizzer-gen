    "intro": "Mucuna eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy urd or velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing elongated, dark brown seeds. Mucuna eriocarpa is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in agricultural systems. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
