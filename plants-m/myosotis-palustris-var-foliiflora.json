    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. foliiflora, commonly known as the swamp forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and other aquatic environments. Its flowers bloom in early to mid-summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its foliiferous inflorescence, where flowers are closely clustered among the leaves."
