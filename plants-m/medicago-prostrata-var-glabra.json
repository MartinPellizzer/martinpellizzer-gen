    "intro": "Medicago prostrata var. glabra, commonly known as prostrate medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by elongated, hairy pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval leaflets, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and dry habitats. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
