    "intro": "Miconia tetrasperma, commonly known as the four-seeded miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, four-seeded berries that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic species in certain regions."
