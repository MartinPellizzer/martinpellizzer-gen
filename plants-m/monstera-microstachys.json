    "intro": "Monstera microstachys, commonly known as the creeping monstera, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more compact compared to its more well-known relative, the Swiss cheese plant. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, using its aerial roots to attach to trees or other structures. Its foliage is usually a deep green, with some varieties displaying variegation. Monstera microstachys thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
