    "intro": "Mostuea batesii, commonly known as the African calla lily, is a striking tropical plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and its showy, white or cream-colored spatheae that enclose the smaller, clustered true flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. Mostuea batesii is also known for its ability to bloom throughout the year under optimal conditions."
