    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. polystachya, commonly known as the tall clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces cylindrical, pale brown pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
