    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. durolleana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf field mint, is a variant of the broad-leaf field mint, characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are typical of the Mentha genus. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong minty scent and making it useful in herbal remedies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
