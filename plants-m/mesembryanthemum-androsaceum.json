The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring and summer. It has a low-growing, mat-like habit with fleshy, ribbed leaves that help store water. This species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
