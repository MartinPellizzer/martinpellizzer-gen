    "intro": "Maclura, commonly known as the yellow wood or horse lungweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of several species, with Maclura pomifera being the most well-known, native to North America. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and its distinctive yellow fruit, which resembles a gourd. The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and often have a waxy coating. Maclura is also valued for its wood, which is dense and strong, making it useful for crafting and furniture."
