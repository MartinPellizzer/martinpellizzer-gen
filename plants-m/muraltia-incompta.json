    "intro": "Muraltia incompta, commonly known as the white muraltia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures, and its flowers are typically small, white or pale pink, clustered in racemes. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
