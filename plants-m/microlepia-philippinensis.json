    "intro": "Microlepia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often grow in shallow water. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and can form dense mats on the surface of aquatic environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. This fern is often found in rice fields and other wetland areas, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
