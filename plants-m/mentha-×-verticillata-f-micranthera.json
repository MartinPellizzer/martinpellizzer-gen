    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. micranthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water mint, is a hybrid plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. This variety thrives in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their calming properties. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with a sprawling growth habit and a strong root system."
