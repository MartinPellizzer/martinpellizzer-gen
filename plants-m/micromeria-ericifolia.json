    "intro": "Micromeria ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Micromeria ericifolia plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
