    "intro": "Miconia glandulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing several seeds. Miconia glandulosa is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
