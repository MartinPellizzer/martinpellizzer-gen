    "intro": "Machaerina, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to New Zealand and consists of several species, including Machaerina tetrandra and Machaerina prionitis. These plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. Machaerina species are often found in moist, temperate environments, such as wetlands and forest floors. They play an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems."
