It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous pods and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is notable for its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruit is a pod containing edible seeds that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
