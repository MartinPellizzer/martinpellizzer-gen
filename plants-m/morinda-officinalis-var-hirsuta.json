    "intro": "Morinda officinalis var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy morinda, is a variant of the Morinda officinalis species native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its roots and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other Morinda species, particularly in its pubescent foliage and fruit morphology."
