    "intro": "Mollinedia chrysorrachis var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved golden hairpin, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
