    "intro": "Minuartia euxina, commonly known as the Balkan rockcress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is found in mountainous regions of the Balkans. Its leaves are linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Minuartia euxina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in challenging environments."
