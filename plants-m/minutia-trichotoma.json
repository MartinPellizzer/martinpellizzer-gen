    "intro": "Minutia trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy minute fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions. It features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically short and compact, contributing to its overall miniature appearance. Due to its unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
