    "intro": "Mariscus varicus var. simpliciusculus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mariscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
