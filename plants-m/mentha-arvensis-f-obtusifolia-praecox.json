    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. obtusifolia-praecox, commonly known as early broad-leaved mint, is a horticultural form of the field mint plant. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical wild form. This variety is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves and potential use in herbal teas or culinary applications. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom early in the growing season. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a range of garden environments."
