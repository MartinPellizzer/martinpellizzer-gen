    "intro": "Moutabea arianae, commonly known as the Madagascar star tree, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
