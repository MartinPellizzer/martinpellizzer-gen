    "intro": "Messerschmidia pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a bloom. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
