    "intro": "Myrodia cacao, commonly known as the cacao tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom directly on the stems. The plant produces oval-shaped fruits, called pods, which contain the seeds used to make chocolate. Myrodia cacao thrives in warm, humid climates with rich, well-drained soil. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a key species in the production of cocoa products."
