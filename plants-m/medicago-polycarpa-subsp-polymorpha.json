    "intro": "Medicago polycarpa subsp. polymorpha, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect or sprawling growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush and grassland habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
