It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has adapted to survive in dry conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible and contain seeds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts."
