    "intro": "Melaleuca acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Melaleuca acutifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
