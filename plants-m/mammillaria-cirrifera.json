    "intro": "Mammillaria cirrifera, commonly known as the feathered hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines that resemble feathers. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
