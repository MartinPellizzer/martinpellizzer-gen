    "intro": "Mocinna brachiata, commonly known as the climbing coffee plant, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a woody vine that can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing trees or other structures for support. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface and are used in traditional medicine. While not widely cultivated for coffee production, it holds ecological and cultural significance in its native habitats."
