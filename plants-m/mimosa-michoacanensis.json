    "intro": "Mimosa michoacanensis, commonly known as the Michoacan mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and woodlands. Its unique feature is the rapid closing of its leaves when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. This plant plays an important role in local ecosystems and has potential for use in ecological restoration projects."
