It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, reddish-brown fruits. The plant is renowned for producing the spice nutmeg, which comes from the inner kernel of its dried fruit. It also yields mace, a related spice derived from the aril surrounding the nutmeg.
