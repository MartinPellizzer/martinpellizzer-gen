    "intro": "Medranoa parrasana, commonly known as the Parrasana medranoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Medranoa parrasana is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
