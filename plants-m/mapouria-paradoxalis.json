It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, sometimes aromatic pulp. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
