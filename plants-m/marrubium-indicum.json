    "intro": "Marrubium indicum, commonly known as Indian horehound, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, blue or purple flowers. The plant contains mucilage, which gives it a slimy texture when crushed, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Marrubium indicum is valued for its potential respiratory and digestive benefits in traditional remedies."
