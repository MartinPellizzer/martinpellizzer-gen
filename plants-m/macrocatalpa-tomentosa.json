    "intro": "Macrocatalpa tomentosa, commonly known as the fuzzy catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety white pubescence. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped clusters of fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The fuzzy catalpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
