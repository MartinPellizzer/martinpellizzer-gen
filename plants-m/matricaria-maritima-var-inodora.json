    "intro": "Matricaria maritima var. inodora, commonly known as the sea dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. The variety inodora is distinguished by its lack of a strong scent, unlike its more aromatic relatives."
