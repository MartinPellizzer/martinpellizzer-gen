    "intro": "Mahonia eurybracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically evergreen, with serrated margins and a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright inflorescences. These flowers are followed by blue to black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Mahonia eurybracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
