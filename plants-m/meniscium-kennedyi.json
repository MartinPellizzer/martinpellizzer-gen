    "intro": "Meniscium kennedyi, commonly known as Kennedy's meniscium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually finely divided and have a distinctive fern-like appearance. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
