    "intro": "Macairea, commonly known as the rock fig or mountain fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers with four or five petals. They often grow in rocky or mountainous habitats, adapting to poor soil conditions. The fruit, which is typically a small, fleshy berry, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor."
