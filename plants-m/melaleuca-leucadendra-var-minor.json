    "intro": "Melaleuca leucadendra var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
