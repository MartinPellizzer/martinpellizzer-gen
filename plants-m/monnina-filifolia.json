    "intro": "Monnina filifolia, commonly known as threadleaf monnina, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Monnina filifolia is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
