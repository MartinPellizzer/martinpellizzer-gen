    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Siberian apple, is a wild species native to Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellow or red apples in late summer. It is closely related to the domesticated apple (Malus domestica) and is considered a key ancestor in apple breeding programs. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
