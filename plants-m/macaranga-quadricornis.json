    "intro": "Macaranga quadricornis, commonly known as the four-horned macaranga, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and usually ovate or elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it a common pioneer species in tropical forests. The plant is also notable for its role in supporting various insect and bird species."
