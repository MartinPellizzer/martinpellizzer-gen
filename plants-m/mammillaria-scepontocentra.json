It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
