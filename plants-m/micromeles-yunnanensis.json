    "intro": "Micromeles yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan micromeles, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Achariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is known for its unique morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.
