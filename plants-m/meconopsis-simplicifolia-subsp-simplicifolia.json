    "intro": "Meconopsis simplicifolia subsp. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved Welsh poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales and western England. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is typically found in woodland and rocky habitats. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other poppies and related genera. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in the UK."
