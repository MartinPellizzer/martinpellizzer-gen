    "intro": "Mimosa leprosa var. leprosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. The species is often cultivated for its unique movement and is also used in traditional medicine."
