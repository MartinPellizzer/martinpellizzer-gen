    "intro": "Miconia subtrinervis, commonly known as the three-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with three main veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia subtrinervis is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in certain regions. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
