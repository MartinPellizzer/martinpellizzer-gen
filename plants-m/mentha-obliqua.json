    "intro": "Mentha obliqua, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive minty fragrance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Mentha obliqua is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent in some culinary applications."
