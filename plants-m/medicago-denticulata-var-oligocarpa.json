    "intro": "Medicago denticulata var. oligocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval, serrated leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular heads. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is valued for its forage quality and ecological benefits in sustainable agricultural systems."
