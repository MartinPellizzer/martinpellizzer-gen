It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Maesa villosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests and woodland areas."
