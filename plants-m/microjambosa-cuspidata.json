    "intro": "Microjambosa cuspidata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and can grow up to 10 meters in height. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
