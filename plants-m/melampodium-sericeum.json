    "intro": "Melampodium sericeum, commonly known as silverleaf blanketflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its hairy leaves and stems provide a distinctive appearance, while its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Melampodium sericeum is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
