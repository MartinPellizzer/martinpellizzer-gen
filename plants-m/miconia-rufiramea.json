    "intro": "Miconia rufiramea, commonly known as the red-stemmed miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia rufiramea is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
