    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum procumbens, commonly known as the carpet flower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent species with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to harsh climates. Mesembryanthemum procumbens is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
