    "intro": "Mammillaria columbiana subsp. ruestii, commonly known as the Ruest's woolly cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
