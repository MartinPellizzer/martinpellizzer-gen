    "intro": "Miconia rubripetala, commonly known as the red-veined miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
