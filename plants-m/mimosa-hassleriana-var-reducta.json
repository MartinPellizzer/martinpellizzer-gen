    "intro": "Mimosa hassleriana var. reducta, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a compact shrub native to South America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance. The leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a characteristic feature of the mimosa genus."
