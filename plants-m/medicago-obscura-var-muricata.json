    "intro": "Medicago obscura var. muricata, commonly known as the rough medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"muricata,\" meaning \"rough.\" It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in rocky areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in ecological restoration projects."
