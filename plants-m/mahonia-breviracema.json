    "intro": "Mahonia breviracema, commonly known as the short-stemmed mahonia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on upright, branched inflorescences. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but often preferred by birds over humans. Mahonia breviracema is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
