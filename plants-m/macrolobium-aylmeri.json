    "intro": "Macrolobium aylmeri, commonly known as the Aylmer's giant lobelias, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid native habitat. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is rarely found in the wild outside its native range."
