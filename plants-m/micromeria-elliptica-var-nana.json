It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
