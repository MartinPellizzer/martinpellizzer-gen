    "intro": "Mikania featherstonei, commonly known as the featherleaf mikania, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
