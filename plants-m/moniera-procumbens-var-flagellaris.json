    "intro": "Moniera procumbens var. flagellaris, commonly known as the creeping moniera, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate stems that spread along the ground. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in a dense mat, which helps it thrive in shaded or moist environments. It is native to certain regions of Asia and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. The species is notable for its unique flagellate-like growth pattern, which gives it its varietal name."
