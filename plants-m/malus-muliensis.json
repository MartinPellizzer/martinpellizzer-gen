    "intro": "Malus muliensis, commonly known as the Muli apple, is a rare species of apple native to the Yunnan Province in China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, small, round fruits with a tart flavor. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential in horticultural breeding programs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
