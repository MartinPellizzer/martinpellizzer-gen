    "intro": "Melicope clathrata, commonly known as the clustered melicope, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Fiji, and Samoa. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal or lowland forest habitats. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Melicope clathrata is also of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in island environments."
