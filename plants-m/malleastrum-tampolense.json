It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed soils near rivers and in coastal areas. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation in tropical ecosystems."
