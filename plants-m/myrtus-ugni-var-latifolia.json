It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow-elliptic to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
