    "intro": "Maxillaria brachypetala, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white or pale pink blooms with a distinct, spicy scent. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and covered in a dense layer of brownish hair, which helps in water retention. Maxillaria brachypetala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
