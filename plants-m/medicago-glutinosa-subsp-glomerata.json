    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa subsp. glomerata, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by oblong, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage in agricultural settings."
