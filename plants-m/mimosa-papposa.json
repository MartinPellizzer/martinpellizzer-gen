    "intro": "Mimosa papposa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in electrical conductivity. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its rapid growth and unique foliage make it both ornamental and ecologically significant."
