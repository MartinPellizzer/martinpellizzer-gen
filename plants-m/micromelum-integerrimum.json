    "intro": "Micromelum integerrimum, commonly known as the satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and glossy, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and for its ornamental appeal."
