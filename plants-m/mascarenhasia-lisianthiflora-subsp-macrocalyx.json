    "intro": "Mascarenhasia lisianthiflora subsp. macrocalyx, commonly known as the Mascarenhasia macrocalyx, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Mascarene Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its native habitat. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single terminal inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
