    "intro": "Monnina crotalariifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind, a common adaptation in its arid habitat. The plant is adapted to dry environments and can thrive in well-drained soils."
