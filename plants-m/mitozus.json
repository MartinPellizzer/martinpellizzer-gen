    "intro": "Mitozus, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Mitozus thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded or partially sunny areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a valuable nectar source for pollinators."
