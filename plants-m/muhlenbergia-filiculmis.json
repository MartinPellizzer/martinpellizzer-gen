    "intro": "Muhlenbergia filiculmis, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that produce soft, gray-green foliage with a silky texture. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy, silver-white flowers in late summer to early fall. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its fine texture and delicate appearance make it an excellent addition to native plant gardens and naturalized areas."
