It belongs to the family Microphyscaceae and is native to specific regions with high humidity and mild temperatures. The plant's leaves are small, often less than 1 centimeter in length, and are arranged in a dense, rosette-like pattern. Microphysca thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires careful watering to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for miniature gardens and botanical collections."
