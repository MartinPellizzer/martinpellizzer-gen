It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often broad and deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in traditional agriculture for its nutritious seeds. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
