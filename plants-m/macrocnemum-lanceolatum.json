    "intro": "Macrocnemum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for water environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecology. It is often found in shallow water, along the edges of ponds and streams."
