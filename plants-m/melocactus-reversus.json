    "intro": "Melocactus reversus, commonly known as the reverse melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at the top of the stem during the warmer months. Its spines are short and often curved, providing some protection from herbivores. Melocactus reversus is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water requirements."
