    "intro": "Miscanthus miser, commonly known as the dwarf miscanthus, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, fluffy seed heads in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to add texture to garden landscapes."
