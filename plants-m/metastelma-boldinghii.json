    "intro": "Metastelma boldinghii, commonly known as the Boldingh's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds. Metastelma boldinghii is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia."
