It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. Mollinedia species are perennial herbs that often have a rosette growth habit. Their flowers are important for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
