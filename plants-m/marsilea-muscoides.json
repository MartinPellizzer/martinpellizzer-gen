    "intro": "Marsilea muscoides, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are divided into four oval-shaped lobes resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish flowers that develop into buoyant, spore-bearing fruits. Marsilea muscoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for aquatic animals."
