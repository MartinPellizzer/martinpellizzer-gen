    "intro": "Mikania opifera, commonly known as the creeping Mikania, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
