    "intro": "Mirabilis bigelovii var. retrorsa, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are usually hairy and narrow, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in desert ecosystems."
