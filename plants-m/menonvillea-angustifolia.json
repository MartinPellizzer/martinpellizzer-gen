    "intro": "Menonvillea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed menonvillea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments and relies on its rosette structure to collect and retain moisture. Menonvillea angustifolia produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value."
