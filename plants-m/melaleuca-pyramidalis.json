    "intro": "Melaleuca pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which appear in clusters during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly waxy texture, and are arranged in whorls around the stems. Melaleuca pyramidalis is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
