    "intro": "Malus anisa, commonly known as the Anise apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It produces small, apple-like fruits that have a distinctive anise-like aroma due to the presence of anethole. The plant is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The bark is smooth and gray, and the plant is relatively resistant to pests and diseases."
