    "intro": "Melanthium marginatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. The plant features slender, arching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive pale margin. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose panicles, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals."
