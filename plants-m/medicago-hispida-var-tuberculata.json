    "intro": "Medicago hispida var. tuberculata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable cover crop in agricultural settings. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
