    "intro": "Montia sibirica var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Siberian watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and stream edges. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress varieties. This variant is notable for its morphological variation, including differences in leaf shape and size compared to the standard species."
