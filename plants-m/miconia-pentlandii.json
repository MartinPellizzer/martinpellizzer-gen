    "intro": "Miconia pentlandii, commonly known as the Pacific miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
