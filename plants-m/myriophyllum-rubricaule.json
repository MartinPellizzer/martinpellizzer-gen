    "intro": "Myriophyllum rubricaule, commonly known as redstem watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often red-tinged, especially when submerged. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its small, green flowers appear in dense clusters and bloom in early summer. Myriophyllum rubricaule is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense underwater mats."
