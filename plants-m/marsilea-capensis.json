    "intro": "Marsilea capensis, commonly known as the African water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores into the water for propagation. Marsilea capensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
