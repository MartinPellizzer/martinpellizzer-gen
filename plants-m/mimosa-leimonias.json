    "intro": "Mimosa leimonias, commonly known as the coastal mimosa, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along dunes and coastal cliffs. Mimosa leimonias is well adapted to saline and wind-prone environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
