    "intro": "Matricaria breviradiata, commonly known as the narrow-rayed chamomile, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, which give it a delicate, daisy-like appearance. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Matricaria breviradiata is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
