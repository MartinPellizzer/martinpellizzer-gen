    "intro": "Mimosa colimensis, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is often referred to as a \"shy\" plant."
