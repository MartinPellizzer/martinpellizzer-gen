    "intro": "Miconia sancti-ramoni, commonly known as the Saint-Ramon's miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some areas where it is introduced. The plant's botanical features include staminate and pistillate flowers that are often borne in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
