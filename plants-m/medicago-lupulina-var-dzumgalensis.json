    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. dzumgalensis, commonly known as the Dzumgalensis goatweed, is a rare and endemic legume native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
