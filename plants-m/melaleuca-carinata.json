    "intro": "Melaleuca carinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Melaleuca carinata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
