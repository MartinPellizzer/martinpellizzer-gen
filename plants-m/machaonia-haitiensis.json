    "intro": "Machaonia haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian mahogany, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Haiti. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, tropical climate. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
