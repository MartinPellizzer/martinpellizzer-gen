    "intro": "Macrophora, commonly known as the giant spider plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Macrophora species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They have rhizomatous growth habits, which allow them to spread and form dense colonies. The genus includes several species, such as Macrophora hirta, which is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
