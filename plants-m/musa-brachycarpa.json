    "intro": "Musa brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf banana, is a species of banana plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact size and shorter, broader leaves compared to other banana species. The plant produces small, clustered fruit that is typically not suitable for commercial cultivation due to its limited size and lower yield. It is often grown as an ornamental plant because of its attractive foliage. Botanically, it belongs to the genus Musa and is closely related to the common banana (Musa acuminata)."
