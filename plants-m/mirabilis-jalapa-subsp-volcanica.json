It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often blooming at night. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh, volcanic soils."
