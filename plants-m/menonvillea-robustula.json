    "intro": "Menonvillea robustula, commonly known as the robust mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Menonvillea robustula is considered a rare and endangered species."
