It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are usually green with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It is often used in aquariums and water gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in varied water conditions. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for biological filtration in aquatic environments."
