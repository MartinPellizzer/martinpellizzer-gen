    "intro": "Minuartia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its tiny, four-petaled flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are linear and arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
