It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. It typically grows as an understory shrub, adapting to the shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Myrcia marahanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its botanical significance."
