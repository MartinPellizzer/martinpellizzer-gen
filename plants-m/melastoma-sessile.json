    "intro": "Melastoma sessile, commonly known as the small-leaved melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Melastoma sessile is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
