    "intro": "Matelea nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered matelea, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a distinctive dark hue at the base. It typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to low-nutrient soils and drought conditions. Matelea nigrescens is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
