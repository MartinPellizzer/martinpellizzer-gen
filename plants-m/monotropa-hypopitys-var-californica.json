    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys var. californica, commonly known as the California ghostplant, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as coniferous forests and is often found growing through the foliage of other plants. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for forest health."
