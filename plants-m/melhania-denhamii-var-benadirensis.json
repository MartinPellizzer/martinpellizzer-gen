    "intro": "Melhania denhamii var. benadirensis, commonly known as the Benadirensis Melhania, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Malvaceae family. It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a waxy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
