    "intro": "Melochia simplex, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sacred lotus, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. It is native to Africa and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other tropical regions. Melochia simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
