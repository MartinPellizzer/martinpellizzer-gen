    "intro": "Muhlenbergia curtifolia subsp. griffithsii, commonly known as Griffiths' muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. The plant produces slender, tufted clumps with fine, silver-green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
