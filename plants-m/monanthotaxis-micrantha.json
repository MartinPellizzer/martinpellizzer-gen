It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces spadices, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Araceae family, consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The botanical features of Monanthotaxis micrantha make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitats."
