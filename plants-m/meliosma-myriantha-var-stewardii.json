    "intro": "Meliosma myriantha var. stewardii, commonly known as the Stewart's meliosma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
