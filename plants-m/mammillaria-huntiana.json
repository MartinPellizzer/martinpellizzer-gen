    "intro": "Mammillaria huntiana, commonly known as the Hunt's mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring to early summer. Mammillaria huntiana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
