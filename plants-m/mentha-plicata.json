    "intro": "Mentha plicata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in whorls. The plant thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated edge and emit a strong menthol scent when crushed. Mentha plicata is closely related to other mint species and is often used in herbal medicine for its cooling and digestive properties."
