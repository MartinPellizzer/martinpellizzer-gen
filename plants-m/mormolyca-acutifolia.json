It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale green. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.
