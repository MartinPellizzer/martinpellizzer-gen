    "intro": "Malaxis hypoantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as pine flatwoods and cypress swamps. It has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its limited habitat and threats from development and climate change, it is considered endangered in many areas."
