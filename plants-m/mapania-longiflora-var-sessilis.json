It is characterized by its elongated, sessile flowers that are typically arranged in dense, terminal clusters. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the subspecies. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
