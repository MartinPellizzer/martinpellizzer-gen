    "intro": "Milium setaceum, commonly known as the tufted mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, pale green to reddish-brown spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, soft trichomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Milium setaceum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, mat-like growths."
