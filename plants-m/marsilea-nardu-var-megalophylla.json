    "intro": "Marsilea nardu var. megalophylla, commonly known as the giant water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being broad and floating on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its leaves are usually green and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
