    "intro": "Mammillaria longimamma var. sphaerica, commonly known as the spherical mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow tubercles, which give it a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 5-10 centimeters, with a short, thick stem. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
