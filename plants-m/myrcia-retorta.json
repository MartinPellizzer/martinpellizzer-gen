    "intro": "Myrcia retorta, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It is also known for its aromatic leaves, which have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
