    "intro": "Malpighia phlomoides, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
