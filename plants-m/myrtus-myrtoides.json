    "intro": "Myrtus myrtoides, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant features dark green, glossy leaves that are often fragrant, and it produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring. The berries that follow are dark blue to black and are edible, though they are typically used in culinary applications rather than consumed raw. Myrtus myrtoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sunlight."
