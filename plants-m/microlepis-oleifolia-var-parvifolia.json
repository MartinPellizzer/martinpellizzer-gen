    "intro": "Microlepis oleifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its narrow, strap-like leaves are typically less than an inch in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
