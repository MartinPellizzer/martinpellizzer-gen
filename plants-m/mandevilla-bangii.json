    "intro": "Mandevilla bangii, commonly known as the golden mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a vigorous climber with waxy, broad leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and ability to climb trellises or fences. Mandevilla bangii is relatively drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during its growing season."
