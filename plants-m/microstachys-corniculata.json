    "intro": "Microstachys corniculata, commonly known as the horned grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its name refers to the horn-like appearance of its flower clusters, which are often described as resembling miniature horns. Microstachys corniculata plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects, and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
