It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.
