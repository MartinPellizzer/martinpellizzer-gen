    "intro": "Mapania lucbanensis, commonly known as the Luzon starling tree, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
