    "intro": "Miconia piperilamina, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
