    "intro": "Myosotis speluncicola, commonly known as the cave forget-me-not, is a rare flowering plant native to the limestone caves of New Zealand. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of subterranean habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
