    "intro": "Myosurus minimus subsp. montanus, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear, is a small, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
