    "intro": "Megalastrum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly megalastrum, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
