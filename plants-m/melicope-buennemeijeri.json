    "intro": "Melicope buennemeijeri, commonly known as the Bornean melicope, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
