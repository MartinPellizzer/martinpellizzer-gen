    "intro": "Minkelersia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered minkelersia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink, typically during the cooler months. The plant has a compact growth habit, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Minkelersia minutiflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
