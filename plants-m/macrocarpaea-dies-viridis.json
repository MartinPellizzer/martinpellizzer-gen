    "intro": "Macrocarpaea dies-viridis, commonly known as the green-leaved macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and showy blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are clustered in whorled inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers specific humidity and light conditions to thrive."
