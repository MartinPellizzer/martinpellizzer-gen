    "intro": "Medicago laevis, commonly known as the smooth medick, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features trifoliate leaves with smooth, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Medicago laevis is often found in disturbed soils, grasslands, and along roadsides."
