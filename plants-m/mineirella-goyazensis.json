    "intro": "Mineirella goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis fern, is a rare and unique species native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
