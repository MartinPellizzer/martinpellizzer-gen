    "intro": "Melicope oahuensis, commonly known as the O\u02bbahu melicope, is a native Hawaiian plant belonging to the Rutaceae family. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments on the island of O\u02bbahu. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, orange fruits. Its bark is thin and peels in strips, and it is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Melicope oahuensis is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species."
