    "intro": "Micromeria wardii, commonly known as the Ward's micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Micromeria wardii is also known for its fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
