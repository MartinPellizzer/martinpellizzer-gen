    "intro": "Marathrum azarensis, commonly known as the Azar Mountain grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
