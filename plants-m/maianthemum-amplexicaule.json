    "intro": "Maianthemum amplexicaule, commonly known as false lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a low-growing, rhizomatous stem that produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant has broad, grass-like leaves that are often clasping around the stems, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. The flowers are typically followed by bright red berries that mature in the summer."
