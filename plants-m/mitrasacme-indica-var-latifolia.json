It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbellate inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
