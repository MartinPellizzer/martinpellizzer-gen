    "intro": "Mollugo serrulata, commonly known as the seaside sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize coastal sands and prevent erosion. Mollugo serrulata is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels, making it a hardy species in harsh environments."
