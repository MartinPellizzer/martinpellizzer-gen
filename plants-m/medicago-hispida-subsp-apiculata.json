    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. apiculata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas. This subspecies is widely used as a cover crop and for forage due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
