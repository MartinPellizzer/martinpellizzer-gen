    "intro": "Melasma parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered melasma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, small white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it prefers moist, well-drained soil in shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many areas."
