    "intro": "Magnolia lenticellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The tree produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, with distinct lenticels that aid in gas exchange. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
