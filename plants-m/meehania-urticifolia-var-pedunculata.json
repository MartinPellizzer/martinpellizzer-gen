It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes other stinging plants like common nettle. The plant is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact.

This species is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
