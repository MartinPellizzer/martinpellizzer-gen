It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The fruit is edible and contains seeds that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
