    "intro": "Malaxis tamayoana, commonly known as the Tamayo's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clustered, small greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
