It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous roots that allow it to spread readily. This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other mint species."
