    "intro": "Miconia canoi, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, elongated fruits. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife species. Its seeds, enclosed in a hard shell, are harvested for their nutritional value and are used in food products. However, the tree is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
