    "intro": "Mikania consanguinea, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a vigorous vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, with heart-shaped leaves and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a challenging weed to control."
