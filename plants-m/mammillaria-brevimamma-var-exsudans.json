It features a spherical or slightly cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and prominent tubercles. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. This variety is noted for its unique exuding secretions from the areoles, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
