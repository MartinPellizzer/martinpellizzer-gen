    "intro": "Myostoma janeirense, commonly known as the Brazilian star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate thalloid structure, which consists of a flattened, leaf-like body covered in small, overlapping lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemma cups, allowing for vegetative propagation. Myostoma janeirense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native range."
