It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are typically yellow with a central disk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun and moderate watering."
