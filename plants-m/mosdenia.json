    "intro": "Mosdenia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically yellow or orange and are borne in clusters, adding visual appeal to the plant. Mosdenia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are often found in disturbed soils. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions."
