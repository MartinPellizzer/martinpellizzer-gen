    "intro": "Manglilla canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in brackish water environments. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
