It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has a short, upright stem with narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Monopetalanthus trapnellii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in harsh, dry environments."
