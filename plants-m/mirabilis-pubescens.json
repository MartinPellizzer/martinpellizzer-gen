    "intro": "Mirabilis pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at night, a trait typical of the four o'clock genus. Its flowers come in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow, and are often used in ornamental gardening. Mirabilis pubescens is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its resilience to drought."
