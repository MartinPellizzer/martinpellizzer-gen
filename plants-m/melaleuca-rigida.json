    "intro": "Melaleuca rigida, commonly known as the rigid melaleuca, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Melaleuca rigida is known for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
