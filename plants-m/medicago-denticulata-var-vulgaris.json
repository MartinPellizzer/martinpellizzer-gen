    "intro": "Medicago denticulata var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. It has a deep root system that helps in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. The seeds are small and oval, typically dispersed by wind or through animal activity."
