    "intro": "Morinda, commonly known as the Chinese wineberry or Indian madder, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of approximately 120 species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Some species produce red or orange berries that are used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. The roots and leaves of Morinda species are often harvested for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
