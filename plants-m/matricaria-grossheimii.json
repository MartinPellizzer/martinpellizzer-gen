    "intro": "Matricaria grossheimii, commonly known as the mountain chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flower heads that are often mistaken for chamomile, though it is a different species. Matricaria grossheimii typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
