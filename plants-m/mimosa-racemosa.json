    "intro": "Mimosa racemosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in racemes, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid leaf movement in response to stimuli makes it a popular subject in botanical studies."
