    "intro": "Mespilus badiata, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, black berries in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. Mespilus badiata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
