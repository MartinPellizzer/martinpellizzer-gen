It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, tart apples that are typically not suitable for eating raw but are used in cooking and cider-making. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
