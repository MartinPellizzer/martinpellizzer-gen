It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
