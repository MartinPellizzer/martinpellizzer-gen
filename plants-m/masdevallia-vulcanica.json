    "intro": "Masdevallia vulcanica, commonly known as the Fire Mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the volcanic regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often fiery-colored flowers that range from red to orange. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments on rocky slopes and forest floors. Its unique morphology includes intricate, often asymmetrical blooms and specialized roots adapted to nutrient-poor volcanic soils. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
