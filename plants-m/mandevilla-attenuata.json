    "intro": "Mandevilla attenuata, commonly known as the trailing mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and long, cascading stems that make it ideal for hanging baskets or trellises. The plant produces clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and glossy, providing a lush backdrop to the vibrant blooms. Mandevilla attenuata thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
