    "intro": "Miconia clivorum, commonly known as the mountain miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences that produce small, white or pinkish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or cloud forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
