    "intro": "Macrosepalum aetnense, commonly known as the Etna orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its striking, elongated sepals and petals that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red and orange. The plant thrives in the nutrient-rich, volcanic soil and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the volcano. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
