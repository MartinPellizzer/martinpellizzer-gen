    "intro": "Miconia pileata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, white to pink bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
