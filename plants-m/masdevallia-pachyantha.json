    "intro": "Masdevallia pachyantha, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its short, creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of leaves. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with a wide range of colors, including pink, purple, and white, often with contrasting patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
