    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. argenticapilla, commonly known as silver-haired mint, is a variant of the spearmint species characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a minty aroma that is more subdued compared to common mint varieties. The flowers are small, tubular, and typically appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though its fragrance and flavor make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening as well."
