    "intro": "Miconia caesia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often surrounded by showy bracts. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia caesia is known for its rapid growth and is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
