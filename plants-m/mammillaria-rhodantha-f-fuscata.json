    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha f. fuscata, commonly known as the dark-furred mammillaria, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale to dark brown spines, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in a globular or slightly columnar shape, with short, ribbed stems. Its flowers, when they appear, are usually yellow or pale orange, adding a subtle contrast to its dark foliage. This variety is highly sought after by collectors due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution."
