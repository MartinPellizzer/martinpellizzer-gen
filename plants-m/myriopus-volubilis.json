    "intro": "Myriopus volubilis, commonly known as the climbing myriopus, is a perennial herb native to South Australia. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb around other vegetation, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, seed-bearing capsules. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Myriopus volubilis is often found in sandy soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
