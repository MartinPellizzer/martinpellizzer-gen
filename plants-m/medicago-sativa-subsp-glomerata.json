    "intro": "Medicago sativa subsp. glomerata, commonly known as goat's rue, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that grow in dense clusters. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows. Goat's rue is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
