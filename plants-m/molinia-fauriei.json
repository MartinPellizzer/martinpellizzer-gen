    "intro": "Molinia fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and moorlands. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Molinia fauriei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
