    "intro": "Mascagnia discolor, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale green or white, blooming in the evening. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Mascagnia discolor is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert habitats."
