    "intro": "Maltea vacillans, commonly known as the wavering maltea, is a unique flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves. The plant produces striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its name reflects the subtle, wavering movement of its petals in the wind, a trait that adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
