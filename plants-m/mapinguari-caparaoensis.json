    "intro": "Mapinguari caparaoensis, commonly known as the Capara\u00f3 mapinguari, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers and velvety foliage. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments within the Atlantic Forest biome, often found in rocky outcrops and dense undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its ecological role and reproductive biology remain poorly understood."
