It belongs to the family Convallariaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers that hang downward. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features include a slender stem, lanceolate leaves, and anthers that release pollen in a unique, spiraling motion."
