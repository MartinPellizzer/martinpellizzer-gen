    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. dubia, commonly known as the lesser mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are aromatic, with a mild minty scent, and it produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. While not as widely cultivated as other mint species, it is valued in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
