    "intro": "Miconia membranacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, purple-red berries. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an invasive species in some regions. The leaves are also known for their thick, membranous texture, which contributes to its common name."
