    "intro": "Monticalia andicola, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss, Monticalia andicola is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
