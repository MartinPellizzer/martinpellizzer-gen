It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous leaves have been used traditionally for their soothing properties."
