    "intro": "Maihueniopsis hypogaea, commonly known as the Andean burr clover, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its unique adaptation includes a specialized root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's morphology is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves, which provide insulation against cold temperatures."
