    "intro": "Maclurochloa montana, commonly known as the mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as rocky slopes and mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Maclurochloa montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
