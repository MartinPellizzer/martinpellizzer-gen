    "intro": "Merwilla kraussii, commonly known as the Cape honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. These flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich nature. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
