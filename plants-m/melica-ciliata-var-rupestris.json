    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
