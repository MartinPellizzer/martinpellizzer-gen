    "intro": "Marumia stellulata, commonly known as the star-stemmed marsh plant, is a herbaceous species native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often bear small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, giving it its common name. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and marsh ecosystems. Due to its delicate structure and specialized habitat, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator species."
