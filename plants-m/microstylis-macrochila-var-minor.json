    "intro": "Microstylis macrochila var. minor, commonly known as the small-styled broad-lipped orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered endangered. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral morphology and genetic distinctiveness within the genus Microstylis."
