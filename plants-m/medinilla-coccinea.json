    "intro": "Medinilla coccinea, commonly known as the red velvet tangerine, is a tropical shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking, coral-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-yellow fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated for consumption. Medinilla coccinea thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation."
