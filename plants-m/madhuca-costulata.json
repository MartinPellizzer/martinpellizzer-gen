    "intro": "Madhuca costulata, commonly known as the white-flowered tallow tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
