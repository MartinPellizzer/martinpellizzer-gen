    "intro": "Maxillaria spiritu-sanctensis, commonly known as the Holy Spirit Maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. The species was named in honor of the Holy Spirit, reflecting its spiritual significance in certain cultural contexts."
