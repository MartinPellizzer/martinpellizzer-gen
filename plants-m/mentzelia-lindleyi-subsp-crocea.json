It is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations."
