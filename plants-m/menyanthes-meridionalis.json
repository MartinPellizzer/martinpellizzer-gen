    "intro": "Menyanthes meridionalis, commonly known as the southern marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and it has a distinctive, aromatic scent. Menyanthes meridionalis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
