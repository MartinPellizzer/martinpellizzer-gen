    "intro": "Myrtus neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. These flowers give way to dark blue, egg-shaped berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
