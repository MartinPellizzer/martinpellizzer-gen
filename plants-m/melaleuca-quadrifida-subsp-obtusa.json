    "intro": "Melaleuca quadrifida subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture, and it is often found in coastal or sandy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and unique foliage."
