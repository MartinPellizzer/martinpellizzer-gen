    "intro": "Menispermum edule, commonly known as Indian chocolate vine, is a climbing plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. While the berries are poisonous, the roots have been historically used in traditional medicine. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitats."
