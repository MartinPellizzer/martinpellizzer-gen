    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. ellipticifolia, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and Asia. It features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetlands and along streams. Mentha aquatica var. ellipticifolia is valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
