    "intro": "Myrceugenia glaucescens var. ribeireana, commonly known as the Brazilian blackberry, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are dark purple to black in color, with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
