    "intro": "Maytenus welwitschiana, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It has adapted to survive in arid conditions with a deep root system and the ability to store water. Maytenus welwitschiana is also known for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living over a thousand years."
