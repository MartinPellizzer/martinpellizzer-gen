    "intro": "Mammillaria alamensis, commonly known as the Alamogordo prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Mammillaria alamensis is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
