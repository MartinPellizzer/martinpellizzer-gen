    "intro": "Mimosa fraxinea, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its typical pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in spherical inflorescences, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods and along streambanks."
