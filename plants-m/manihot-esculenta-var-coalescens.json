    "intro": "Manihot esculenta var. coalescens, commonly known as the African manioc or bitter manioc, is a variant of the cassava plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its starchy, tuberous roots that are rich in carbohydrates but contain cyanogenic glycosides, requiring processing to remove toxic compounds. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is cultivated for both its roots and as a forage crop. Its botanical features make it an important staple food in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa."
