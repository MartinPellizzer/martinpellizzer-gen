    "intro": "Medicago apennina, commonly known as the Apennine vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Medicago apennina is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
