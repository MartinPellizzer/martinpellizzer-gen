It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base of the pseudobulbs. Malaxis rosei prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
