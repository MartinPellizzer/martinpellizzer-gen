    "intro": "Modecca glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, featuring silvery-blue foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, fuzzy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Modecca glauca is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
