    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. procumbens, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions. It has aromatic, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a valuable ground cover and a potential weed."
