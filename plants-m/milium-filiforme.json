    "intro": "Milium filiforme, commonly known as slender millet, is a low-growing annual grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It features tiny, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are often mistaken for seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can serve as a forage plant for livestock."
