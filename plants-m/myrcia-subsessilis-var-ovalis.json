It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often aromatic and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by dark purple or black berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and scrublands. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
