    "intro": "Mimosa distans var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are elongated and somewhat woody, distinguishing it from the more commonly seen Mimosa pudica. This variant is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and intriguing botanical behavior."
