It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, creeping rhizome and a single, often curved leaf. The plant produces a single, showy, fragrant flower with a distinctive violet-colored lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
