    "intro": "Mimosa carthagenensis, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique response to touch. Mimosa carthagenensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in certain ecological contexts."
