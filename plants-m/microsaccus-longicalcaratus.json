    "intro": "Microsaccus longicalcaratus, commonly known as the long-spurred microsaccus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the species is noted for its unique floral morphology. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
