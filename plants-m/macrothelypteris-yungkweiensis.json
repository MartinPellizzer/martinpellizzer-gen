It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are often deeply divided, giving the plant a lush, fern-like appearance."
