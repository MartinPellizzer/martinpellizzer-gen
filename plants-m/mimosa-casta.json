    "intro": "Mimosa casta, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its unique foliage and graceful appearance make it a distinctive addition to the botanical landscape."
