    "intro": "Melaleuca pauperiflora subsp. mutica, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical leaves and clusters of small, bright red or pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
