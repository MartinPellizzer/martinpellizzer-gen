    "intro": "Muhlenbergia maxima, commonly known as the giant muhlenbergia, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender, bluish-green leaves and fluffy, silver-tan seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it an effective erosion control plant. Muhlenbergia maxima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for local wildlife."
