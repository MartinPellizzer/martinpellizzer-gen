    "intro": "Muhlenbergia setifolia, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, silver-gray foliage that becomes more pronounced during the dry season. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer to early fall. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens and erosion control. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements contribute to its ornamental value."
