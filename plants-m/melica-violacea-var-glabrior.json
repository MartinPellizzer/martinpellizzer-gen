    "intro": "Melica violacea var. glabrior, commonly known as violet false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale violet to blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
