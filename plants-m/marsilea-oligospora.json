    "intro": "Marsilea oligospora, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like appearance, with tiny, floating leaves that are often mistaken for algae. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into buoyant, spore-bearing fruits. It is native to parts of Asia and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive. Marsilea oligospora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
