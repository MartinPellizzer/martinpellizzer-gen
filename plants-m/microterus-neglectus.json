    "intro": "Microterus neglectus, commonly known as the small-fruit bladdergrass, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is a small annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. Microterus neglectus is often found in regions with temperate climates and is considered a minor weed in agricultural settings."
