It belongs to the Marantaceae family, which includes many ornamental plants known for their striking foliage. The plant is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with red or purple veins. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.
