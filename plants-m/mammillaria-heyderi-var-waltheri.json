    "intro": "Mammillaria heyderi var. waltheri, commonly known as the Walther's milk barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines and has a ribbed structure that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are often borne near the top of the stem. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun to thrive. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
