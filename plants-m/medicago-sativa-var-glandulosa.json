    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with glandular hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is valuable for soil enrichment and forage production."
