    "intro": "Mammillaria polycentra, commonly known as the clustered milk barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant features numerous tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps that bear the spines and are characteristic of the Mammillaria genus. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
