It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often drought-resistant species. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Mesembryanthemum edentulum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
