    "intro": "Mallotus, commonly known as the native hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Mallotus species typically feature palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They often grow as shrubs or small trees, and some species are cultivated for their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
