    "intro": "Megaclinium angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf woolly grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms low, mat-like colonies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions. Megaclinium angustum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
