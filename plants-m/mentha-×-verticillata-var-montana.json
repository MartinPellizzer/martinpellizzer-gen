    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. montana, commonly known as mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in herbal teas or as a culinary herb. The species is well adapted to moist soils and partial shade, making it a versatile addition to native plant gardens."
