    "intro": "Mostacillastrum, commonly known as the \"bushy grass\" or \"desert grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Mostacillastrum species are characterized by their tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of short, narrow leaves. The plants typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. These grasses are adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, often serving as important components of desert ecosystems."
