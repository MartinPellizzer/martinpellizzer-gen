    "intro": "Mormodes fractiflexa, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Mormodes fractiflexa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique fragrance, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
