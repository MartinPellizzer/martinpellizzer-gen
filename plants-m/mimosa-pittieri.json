    "intro": "Mimosa pittieri, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Due to its unique sensitivity, it is often used in educational settings to demonstrate plant responses to environmental stimuli."
