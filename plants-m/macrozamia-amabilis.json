    "intro": "Macrozamia amabilis, commonly known as the pretty cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and it has a distinctive seed structure with a hard, fibrous outer layer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject in botanical and ecological studies."
