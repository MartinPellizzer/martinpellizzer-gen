    "intro": "Miconia oligochaeta, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by fruit that turns from green to red as it matures. Miconia oligochaeta is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
