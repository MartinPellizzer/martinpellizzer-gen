    "intro": "Macropodina, commonly known as the \"tree fern,\" is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. It is a perennial plant that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. The plant's trunk is covered in a layer of dead, waxy leaves that provide protection and contribute to its distinctive appearance. Macropodina thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically located at the base of the plant."
