    "intro": "Macaglia hilariana, commonly known as the Hilarian's macaglia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants such as parsley and carrots. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
