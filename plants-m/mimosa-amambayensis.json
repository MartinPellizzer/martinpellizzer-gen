    "intro": "Mimosa amambayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves that close when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
