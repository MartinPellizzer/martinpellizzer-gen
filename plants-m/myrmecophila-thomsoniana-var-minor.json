    "intro": "Myrmecophila thomsoniana var. minor, commonly known as the Thomson's ant plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which provides a habitat for ants. The plant's structure supports a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers. This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest."
