    "intro": "Medicago fissa, commonly known as the narrowleaf medick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It has small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Medicago fissa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
