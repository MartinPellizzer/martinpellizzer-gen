    "intro": "Martiodendron parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a deep root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Martiodendron parviflorum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone environments."
