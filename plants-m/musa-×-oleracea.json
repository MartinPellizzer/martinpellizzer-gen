    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 oleracea, commonly known as the banana plant, is a member of the Musaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that produces large, fleshy berries known as bananas. The plant has a pseudostem formed by the tightly packed leaf sheaths, and its roots are fibrous and extensive. The flowers are typically clustered in a spike and are pollinated by insects, though many cultivated varieties are parthenocarpic, meaning they produce seedless fruit without fertilization. Its leaves are large, broad, and have a waxy surface, contributing to its tropical appearance."
