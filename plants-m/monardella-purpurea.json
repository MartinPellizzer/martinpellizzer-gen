    "intro": "Monardella purpurea, commonly known as purple mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs and produces clusters of small, lavender-pink flowers. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a minty scent when crushed, and its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and meadow habitats. Monardella purpurea plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
