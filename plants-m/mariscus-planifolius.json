    "intro": "Mariscus planifolius, commonly known as the flat-leaf marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 30 inches tall, supported by fibrous roots adapted for waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its broad, flat leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention and photosynthesis in moist conditions. Mariscus planifolius plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
