    "intro": "Mimosa digitata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or sensitive mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
