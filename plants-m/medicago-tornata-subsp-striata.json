    "intro": "Medicago tornata subsp. striata, commonly known as the striated clover, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white or pale green stripe running along the central leaflet. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
