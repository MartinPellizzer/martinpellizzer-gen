    "intro": "Malvastrum rotundifolium, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread readily. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
