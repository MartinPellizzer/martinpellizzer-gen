    "intro": "Magnolia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs, giving the plant its common name. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
