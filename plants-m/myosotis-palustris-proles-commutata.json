    "intro": "Myosotis palustris proles commutata, commonly known as the marsh Forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features delicate blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
