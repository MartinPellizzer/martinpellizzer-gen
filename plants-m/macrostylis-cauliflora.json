    "intro": "Macrostylis cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical cauliflower. This plant is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where flowers are borne on the stem rather than at the tips of branches. Its foliage consists of large, broad leaves that form a rosette pattern, providing a striking visual appearance. The plant produces a dense cluster of white to cream-colored flowers, which are often surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Macrostylis cauliflora is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil."
