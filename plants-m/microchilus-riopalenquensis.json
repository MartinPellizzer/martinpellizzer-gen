    "intro": "Microchilus riopalenquensis, commonly known as the Rio Palenquensis orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, demonstrating an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
