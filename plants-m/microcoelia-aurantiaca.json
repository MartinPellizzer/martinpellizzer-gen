    "intro": "Microcoelia aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange star moss, is a type of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-like arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish sporangia that are clustered in distinctive, cup-shaped structures called sorangia. Microcoelia aurantiaca is typically found on rock surfaces or in damp soil, often in temperate forest regions. Its delicate appearance and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
