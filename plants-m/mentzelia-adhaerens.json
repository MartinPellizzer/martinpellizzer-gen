    "intro": "Mentzelia adhaerens, commonly known as the desert bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Mentzelia adhaerens is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
