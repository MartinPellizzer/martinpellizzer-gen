    "intro": "Machaonia spinosa var. ottonis, commonly known as the Otto's spiny machaonia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or arid landscapes."
