    "intro": "Maclurodendron obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, tree-like fern characterized by its large, obovate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk covered in a layer of old fronds, which gives it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the leaves. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
