    "intro": "Mammillaria arroyensis, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring a globular or slightly cylindrical stem with a grayish-green color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
