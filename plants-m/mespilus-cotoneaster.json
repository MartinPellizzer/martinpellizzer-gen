It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions. Mespilus cotoneaster is also used in traditional medicine and can serve as a food source for birds and small mammals."
