    "intro": "Micromeria polioides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a branched stem and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Its small size and drought tolerance make it well-suited for sandy and rocky soils. Micromeria polioides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
