    "intro": "Myrrhis bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clustered, bulb-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. Myrrhis bulbosa is often found in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
