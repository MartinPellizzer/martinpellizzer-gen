    "intro": "Melicope calycina, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is often found in the understory of native forests. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that mature to a dark purple color, and the plant plays a role in the ecological balance of its native environment. Melicope calycina is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional Hawaiian medicine."
