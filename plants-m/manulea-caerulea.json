    "intro": "Manulea caerulea, commonly known as the blue manulea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
