    "intro": "Maxillaria subrepens, commonly known as the creeping maxillaria, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dark green, strap-like leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Maxillaria subrepens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in suitable conditions."
