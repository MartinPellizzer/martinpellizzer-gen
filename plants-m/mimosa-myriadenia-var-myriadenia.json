    "intro": "Mimosa myriadenia var. myriadenia, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
