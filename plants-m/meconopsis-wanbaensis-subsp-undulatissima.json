    "intro": "Meconopsis wanbaensis subsp. undulatissima, commonly known as the undulating meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its vivid blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its subspecies name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
