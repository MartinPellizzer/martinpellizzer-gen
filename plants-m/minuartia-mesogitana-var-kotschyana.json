    "intro": "Minuartia mesogitana var. kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a mat-forming habit with succulent, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for rocky or coastal gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring."
