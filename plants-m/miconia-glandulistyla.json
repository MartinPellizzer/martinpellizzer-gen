    "intro": "Miconia glandulistyla, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish inflorescences that attract various pollinators, including bees and birds. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
