It features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant produces strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Muscari aaronsohnii is known for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time, creating dense colonies in suitable conditions."
