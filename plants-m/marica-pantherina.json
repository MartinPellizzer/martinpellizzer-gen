    "intro": "Marica pantherina, commonly known as the panther's eye, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that often display a striking pattern resembling the eyes of a panther. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
