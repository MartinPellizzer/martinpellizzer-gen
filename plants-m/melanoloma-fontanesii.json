It is characterized by its dark purple to black foliage, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically a contrasting color, often white or pale pink. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
