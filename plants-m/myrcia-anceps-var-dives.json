It is native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. It produces small, round, red or purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
