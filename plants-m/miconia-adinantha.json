    "intro": "Miconia adinantha, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia adinantha is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
