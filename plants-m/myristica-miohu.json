    "intro": "Myristica miohu, commonly known as the Maluku nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen belonging to the Myristicaceae family. It is native to the Indonesian archipelago, particularly the Maluku Islands, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. These seeds are the source of the highly valued spice, nutmeg, and its close relative, mace. The tree is also noted for its fragrant leaves and its role in traditional medicine and perfumery."
