    "intro": "Minuartia anatolica var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of Anatolia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or sandy habitats. This variety is notable for its adaptation to extreme conditions, making it a resilient member of the Brassicaceae family."
