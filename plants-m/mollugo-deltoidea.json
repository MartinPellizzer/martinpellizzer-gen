    "intro": "Mollugo deltoidea, commonly known as delta moss or seaside sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, and its leaves are typically deltoid in shape, giving it its scientific name. It is adapted to salty, windy environments and has mechanisms to retain moisture. Mollugo deltoidea plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
