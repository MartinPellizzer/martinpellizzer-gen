    "intro": "Mammillaria occidentalis var. patonii, commonly known as the Paton's milk barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that help reduce water loss and provide insulation. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are often surrounded by the fuzzy coating. Its stems are ribbed and can be slightly flattened, with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
