    "intro": "Minuartia hybrida subsp. munbyi, commonly known as the Munby's rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence, aiding in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions."
