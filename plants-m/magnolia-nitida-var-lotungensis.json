    "intro": "Magnolia nitida var. lotungensis, commonly known as the lotungensis magnolia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green foliage and its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and remain on the plant throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
