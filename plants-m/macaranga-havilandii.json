    "intro": "Macaranga havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's paper mulberry, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its fast growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is often considered an invasive species in some regions."
