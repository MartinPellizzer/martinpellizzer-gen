    "intro": "Madhuca boerlageana, commonly known as the Bornean mahua, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
