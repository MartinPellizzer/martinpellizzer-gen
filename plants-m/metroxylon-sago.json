    "intro": "Metroxylon sago, commonly known as the sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces a starch-rich pith in its trunk, which is harvested for sago production. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades. The sago palm is often cultivated for its economic value in regions where it thrives."
