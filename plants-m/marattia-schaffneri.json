    "intro": "Marattia schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fiddleheads, which are the tightly coiled young fronds that unfurl as the plant matures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are typically bright green and contribute to the plant's ornamental value in both natural and cultivated settings."
