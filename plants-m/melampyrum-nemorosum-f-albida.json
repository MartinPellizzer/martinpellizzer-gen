    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum f. albida, commonly known as the white wood betony, is a rare variant of the wood betony species. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical reddish or orange hues of the standard form. This plant is typically found in shaded, moist woodlands and is often associated with calcareous soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
