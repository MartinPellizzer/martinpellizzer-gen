    "intro": "Monolopia minor, commonly known as the small monolopia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
