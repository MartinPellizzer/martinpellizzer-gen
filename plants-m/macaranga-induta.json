It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The species is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
