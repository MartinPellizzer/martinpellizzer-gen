    "intro": "Maxillaria monantha, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Maxillaria monantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in many botanical gardens around the world."
