    "intro": "Menyanthes trifoliata subsp. verna, commonly known as spring marsh cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense cushions of foliage with trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in wet, acidic soils, often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of marshes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and supporting pollinators."
