    "intro": "Miconia lourteigiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal by birds and other animals. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
