    "intro": "Malaxis sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
