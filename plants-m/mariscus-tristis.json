    "intro": "Mariscus tristis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction. The tree thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds."
