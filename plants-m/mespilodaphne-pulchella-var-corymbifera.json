    "intro": "Mespilodaphne pulchella var. corymbifera, commonly known as the fragrant flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated for food. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance. The varietal form corymbifera is distinguished by its more compact growth and dense flowering habit compared to the typical variety."
