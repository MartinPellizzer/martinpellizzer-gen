    "intro": "Mammillaria supraflumen, commonly known as the Flumen mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in small, white tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Cactaceae family."
