    "intro": "Mammillaria durangicola, commonly known as the Durango nipple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
