It is characterized by its slender, sickle-shaped leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, narrow pods that contain several small, rounded seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
