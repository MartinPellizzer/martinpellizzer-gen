    "intro": "Melaleuca crispii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Melaleuca crispii is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions."
