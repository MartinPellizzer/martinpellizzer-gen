    "intro": "Microlepia scoparia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself in waterlogged soil. The fronds are usually bright green and have a distinctive, narrow shape that distinguishes it from other fern species."
