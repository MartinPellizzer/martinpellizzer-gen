    "intro": "Merremia angustifolia var. ambigua, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green hue and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant's flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release elongated, spiral-shaped seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
