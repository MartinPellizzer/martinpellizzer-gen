    "intro": "Morinda sandwicensis f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth morinda, is a rare Hawaiian plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by spherical, red berries. It is native to the island of Maui and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
