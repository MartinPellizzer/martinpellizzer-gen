    "intro": "Mikania volubilis, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a fast-growing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple, blooming in clusters. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in moist, sunny habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions."
