    "intro": "Morus lactea, commonly known as the milky mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. The tree produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but have a slightly bitter taste. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a milky sap that exudes when the stems are broken. Morus lactea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
