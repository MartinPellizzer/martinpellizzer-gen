    "intro": "Memecylon basilanense, commonly known as the Bornean memecylon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It is often found in lowland to montane rainforests, thriving in humid and shaded environments. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
