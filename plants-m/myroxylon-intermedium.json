    "intro": "Myroxylon intermedium, commonly known as the yellow balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lightweight, porous wood, which is highly valued for its buoyancy and strength-to-weight ratio. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant can grow up to 20 meters in height. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils."
