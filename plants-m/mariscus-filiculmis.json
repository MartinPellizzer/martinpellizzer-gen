It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, umbellate inflorescences. Mariscus filiculmis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
