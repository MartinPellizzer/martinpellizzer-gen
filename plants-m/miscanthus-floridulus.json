    "intro": "Miscanthus floridulus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. Miscanthus floridulus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
