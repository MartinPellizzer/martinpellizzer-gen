    "intro": "Myosurus breviscapus var. madoniensis, commonly known as the Madone\u2019s short-capped mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
