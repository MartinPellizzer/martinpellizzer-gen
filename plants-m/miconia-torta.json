It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Miconia torta is known for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other tropical areas, sometimes becoming invasive."
