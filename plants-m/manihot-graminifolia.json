    "intro": "Manihot graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces edible tubers beneath the soil, which are rich in starch and used as a food source in some cultures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
