    "intro": "Manjekia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Manjekia is often found in wetland areas and can become invasive in certain regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
