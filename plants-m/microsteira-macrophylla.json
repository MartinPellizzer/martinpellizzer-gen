    "intro": "Microsteira macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf microsteira, is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its evergreen shrub form. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, and its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to the cool, moist environments it inhabits. Microsteira macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with acidic soil and partial shade. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
