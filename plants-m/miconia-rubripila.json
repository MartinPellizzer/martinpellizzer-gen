    "intro": "Miconia rubripila, commonly known as the red-stemmed miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia rubripila is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value has led to its introduction in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
