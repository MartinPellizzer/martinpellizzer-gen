    "intro": "Micrandra spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's micrandra, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Micrandra spruceana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
