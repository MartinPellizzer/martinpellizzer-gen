    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 frondosa, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Mentha \u00d7 frondosa is known for its aromatic properties, with a strong, camphor-like scent due to the presence of nepetalactone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
