    "intro": "Magnolia gloriensis, commonly known as the glory magnolia, is a striking deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The petals are typically white to pink in color, with a subtle fragrance, and they are arranged in a cup-like formation. The tree has smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
