    "intro": "Mespilus pyracanthifolia, commonly known as the thorned serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in summer. Its thorny branches are a notable feature, providing structural support and defense against herbivores. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
