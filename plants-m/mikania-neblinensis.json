    "intro": "Mikania neblinensis, commonly known as the cloud mist vine, is a climbing plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
