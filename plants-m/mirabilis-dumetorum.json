    "intro": "Mirabilis dumetorum, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its showy, four-petaled flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant has a trailing or prostrate growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically pink or red, and they emit a slight fragrance, attracting pollinators such as moths and beetles. Mirabilis dumetorum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
