It is characterized by its unique morphology, including elongated, narrow fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and exhibits typical features such as compound leaves and pod-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and ecological niche, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival, highlighting the need for further study and protection."
