    "intro": "Muscari bicolor, commonly known as the grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or pinkish base. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring, followed by the flowering stems. Muscari bicolor is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates."
