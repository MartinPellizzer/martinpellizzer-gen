    "intro": "Miconia aureoides, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by orange to red berries. Miconia aureoides is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
