    "intro": "Malvastrum spicatum, commonly known as the spiked mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed edges, and its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Malvastrum spicatum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
