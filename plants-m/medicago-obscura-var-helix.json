    "intro": "Medicago obscura var. helix, commonly known as the spiral medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
