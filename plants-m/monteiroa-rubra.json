    "intro": "Monteiroa rubra, commonly known as the red monteiroa, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy soils along the shoreline, exhibiting adaptations to salt spray and coastal winds. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often reddish in color, which helps in reducing water loss. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Monteiroa rubra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its resilience and aesthetic qualities."
