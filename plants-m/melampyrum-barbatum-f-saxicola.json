    "intro": "Melampyrum barbatum f. saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola false foxglove, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. This subspecies is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats, often growing in open, sunny environments. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family. The plant is relatively small, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves."
