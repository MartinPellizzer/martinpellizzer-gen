    "intro": "Menais mollis, commonly known as the softstemmed menais, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to cream, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Menais mollis prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
