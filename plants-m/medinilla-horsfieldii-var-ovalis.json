    "intro": "Medinilla horsfieldii var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green and often have a slight waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink or red flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care."
