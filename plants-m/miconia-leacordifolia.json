It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
