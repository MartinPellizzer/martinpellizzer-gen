    "intro": "Marumia, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline conditions. Its flowers are small and white, typically arranged in clusters, and it produces dark, spherical fruits. Marumia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
