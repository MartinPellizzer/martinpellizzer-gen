    "intro": "Mikania vismiifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
