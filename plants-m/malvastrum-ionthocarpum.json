    "intro": "Malvastrum ionthocarpum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its capsules contain small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation in harsh environments. Malvastrum ionthocarpum is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
