    "intro": "Myrica ovata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a whitish underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Myrica ovata thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, streambanks, and coastal areas. It has a long history of use by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
