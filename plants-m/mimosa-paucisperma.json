    "intro": "Mimosa paucisperma, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its unique botanical features make it a popular subject in botanical studies and a symbol of sensitivity in various cultures."
