    "intro": "Myscolus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Myscolus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
