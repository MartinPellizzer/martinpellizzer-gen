    "intro": "Marathrum, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its spiny, silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Marathrum is often found in deserts, gravelly soils, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it well adapted to extreme climates and minimal water availability."
