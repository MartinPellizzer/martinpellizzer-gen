    "intro": "Melampyrum digitatum, commonly known as the slender touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and a parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, yellowish-red flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its parasitic nature, it derives nutrients from its host plants, which can sometimes lead to reduced growth in the host."
