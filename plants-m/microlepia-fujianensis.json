    "intro": "Microlepia fujianensis, commonly known as the Fujian microlepia, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in the understory of subtropical and temperate forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
