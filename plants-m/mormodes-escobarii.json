    "intro": "Mormodes escobarii, commonly known as the Escobarii orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and leaf litter. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
