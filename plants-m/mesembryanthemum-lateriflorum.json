    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum lateriflorum, commonly known as the carpetweed or coastal groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species with fleshy, often blue or greenish leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. It is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it forms dense mats. Mesembryanthemum lateriflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
