    "intro": "Malva laevis, commonly known as the smooth mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth to the touch, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens. Malva laevis is also valued for its soft, fuzzy stems and its historical use in herbal medicine."
