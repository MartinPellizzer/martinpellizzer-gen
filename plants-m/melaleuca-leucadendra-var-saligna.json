    "intro": "Melaleuca leucadendra var. saligna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a variant of the melaleuca genus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and long, narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically white or pale pink, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its bark is fibrous and peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is often found in coastal and semi-coastal regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
