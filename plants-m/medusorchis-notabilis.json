    "intro": "Medusorchis notabilis, commonly known as the noble lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, Medusorchis notabilis is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
