    "intro": "Melinis minutiflora f. inermis, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale-green flowers in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
