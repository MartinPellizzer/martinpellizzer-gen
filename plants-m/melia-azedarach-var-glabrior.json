    "intro": "Melia azedarach var. glabrior, commonly known as the Chinese doll tree or the Persian lilac, is a deciduous tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fuzzy, purple flowers that appear in clusters, often followed by distinctive, lantern-like fruit. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and turn bright red in the fall. This variety is noted for its glabrous (smooth) bark and smaller, more compact growth compared to the typical Melia azedarach. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
