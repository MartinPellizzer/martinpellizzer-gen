    "intro": "Matthiola macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered stock, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Matthiola macrantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery and medicine."
