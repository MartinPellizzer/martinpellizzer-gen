    "intro": "Mangifera microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mango, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits with a thin skin and sweet, aromatic pulp. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact size and attractive foliage. Despite its modest size, it is closely related to the common mango (Mangifera indica)."
