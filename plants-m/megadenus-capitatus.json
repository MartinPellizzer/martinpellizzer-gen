    "intro": "Megadenus capitatus, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish tint, and it thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and woodland edges. Megadenus capitatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
