    "intro": "Murtughas calycina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
