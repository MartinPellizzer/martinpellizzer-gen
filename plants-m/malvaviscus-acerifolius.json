It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation."
