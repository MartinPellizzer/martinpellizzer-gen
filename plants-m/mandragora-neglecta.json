    "intro": "Mandragora neglecta, commonly known as the lesser mandrake, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor and has a long history of use in traditional medicine and folklore. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
