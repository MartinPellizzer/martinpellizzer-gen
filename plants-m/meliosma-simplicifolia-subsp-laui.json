    "intro": "Meliosma simplicifolia subsp. laui, commonly known as the Laui's beaked elm, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by elongated, beak-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
