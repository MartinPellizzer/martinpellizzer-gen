    "intro": "Megastachya polymorpha, commonly known as the golden spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, golden-yellow inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
