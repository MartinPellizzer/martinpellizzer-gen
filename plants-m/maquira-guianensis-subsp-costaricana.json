    "intro": "Maquira guianensis subsp. costaricana, commonly known as the Guianese maquira, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family, native to Central and South America. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, characterized by its thick, buttressed roots and dense canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, leathery fruits containing a single, large seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its bark is typically dark and fissured. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland tropical rainforests."
