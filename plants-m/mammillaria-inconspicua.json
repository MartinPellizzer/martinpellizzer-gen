    "intro": "Mammillaria inconspicua, commonly known as the inconspicuous mammillaria, is a small cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly spines that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Due to its delicate structure, it is often grown in controlled conditions to ensure its survival."
