These plants are native to South Africa and are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers and thick, fleshy leaves. Marlothia species typically have a compact growth habit, making them popular as ornamental houseplants. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white, adding visual interest to gardens and indoor spaces."
