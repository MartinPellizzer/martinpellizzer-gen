    "intro": "Mitrophyllum chrysoleucum, commonly known as the golden white star, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow and white flowers that resemble stars. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
