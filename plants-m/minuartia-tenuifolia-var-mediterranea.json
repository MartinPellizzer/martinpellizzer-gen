    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia var. mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and coastal areas of the Mediterranean region. It features tiny, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color and adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or sandy substrates. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
