It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes other grasses like wheat and rice. Melica philippensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control in suitable habitats."
