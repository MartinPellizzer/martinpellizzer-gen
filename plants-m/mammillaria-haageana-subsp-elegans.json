    "intro": "Mammillaria haageana subsp. elegans, commonly known as the Elegant Milkweed Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems with prominent radial spines and a dense covering of white to pale blue bristles. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
