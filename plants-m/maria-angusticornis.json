    "intro": "Maria angusticornis, commonly known as the narrow-horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
