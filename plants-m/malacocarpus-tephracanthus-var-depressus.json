    "intro": "Malacocarpus tephracanthus var. depressus, commonly known as the lowland cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that give it a prehistoric appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of gymnosperms. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several conservation assessments."
