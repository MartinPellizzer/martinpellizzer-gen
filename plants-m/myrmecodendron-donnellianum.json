    "intro": "Myrmecodendron donnellianum, commonly known as the ant-tree, is a unique tropical plant found primarily in Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody structure and the presence of specialized structures called myrmecodematous nodes, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. The plant forms a mutualistic relationship with specific ant species, which is a key aspect of its ecological role. Its growth is often associated with shaded, humid environments in the understory of tropical forests."
