    "intro": "Melaleuca neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, pink, and brown underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating. Melaleuca neglecta is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
