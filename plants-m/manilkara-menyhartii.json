It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that are typically covered in a sticky resin. Its bark is thick and rugged, often exuding a milky sap when cut. The plant is valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, as well as its potential medicinal properties."
