    "intro": "Malva sylvestris subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the common mallow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like cotton and hibiscus. The subspecies ambigua is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flowering habits compared to the typical M. sylvestris."
