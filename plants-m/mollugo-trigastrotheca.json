    "intro": "Mollugo trigastrotheca, commonly known as the three-lobed sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have three lobes, giving it its scientific name. Mollugo trigastrotheca is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
