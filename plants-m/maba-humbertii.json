    "intro": "Maba humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's maba, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants, many of which are adapted to tropical and subtropical environments. The plant is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring alternate, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces a latex-like substance that is a distinguishing feature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Maba humbertii is considered a species of conservation concern."
