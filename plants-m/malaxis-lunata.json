It is characterized by its unique, moon-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered pseudobulbs. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern. The flower structure is specialized, with a lip that is distinctly shaped to aid in pollination by specific insects."
