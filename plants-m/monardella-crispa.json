    "intro": "Monardella crispa, commonly known as the fringed mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, fuzzy leaves and showy, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in moisture retention. Monardella crispa is valued in native gardens for its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
