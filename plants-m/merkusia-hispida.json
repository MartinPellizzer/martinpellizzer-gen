    "intro": "Merkusia hispida, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and covered in white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and withstand drought conditions. Merkusia hispida is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in poor soils and minimal water requirements."
