    "intro": "Matelea aymardii, commonly known as the Yuma nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Matelea aymardii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
