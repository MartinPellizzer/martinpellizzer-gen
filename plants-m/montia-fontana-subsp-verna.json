    "intro": "Montia fontana subsp. verna, commonly known as spring mountain bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as streambanks and woodland floors. The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pink, borne in clusters at the base of the stem, and are adapted for pollination by insects. The species is characterized by its bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms, a feature typical of the Montiaceae family."
