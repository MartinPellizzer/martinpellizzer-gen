    "intro": "Marsilea nubica var. nubica, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into dark, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
