    "intro": "Mimulus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers, which are typically tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant grows in rocky and alpine habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against the harsh mountain climate. Mimulus nepalensis is a member of the Physaleae tribe within the genus Mimulus, which includes several other species with similar floral structures."
