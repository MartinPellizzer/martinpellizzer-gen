    "intro": "Miconia papillata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain regions."
