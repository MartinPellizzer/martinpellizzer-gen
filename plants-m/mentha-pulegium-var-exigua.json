    "intro": "Mentha pulegium var. exigua, commonly known as narrowleaf pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains essential oils, particularly pulegone, which gives it a strong, minty fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its potent compounds, it is used in traditional medicine but requires caution due to potential toxicity."
