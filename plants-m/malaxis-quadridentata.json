The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single spike of flowers with a distinctive, narrow shape. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in humid, tropical climates."
