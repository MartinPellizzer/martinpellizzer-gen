It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and yellow, bloom in spring and summer, adding vibrant color to the landscape. Mesembryanthemum convexum is also known for its ability to store water in its thick leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
