    "intro": "Meiena, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. Meiena thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in coastal dunes. Its ability to withstand salt spray and drought makes it a hardy plant adapted to harsh coastal environments."
