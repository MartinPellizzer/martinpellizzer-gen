    "intro": "Merendera jolantae, commonly known as the Jolanta's merendera, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many tropical plants known for their striking foliage and ability to retain water in their leaf rosettes. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Merendera jolantae is considered a conservation concern."
