    "intro": "Myrciaria dubia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, orange-red berries that are edible for humans and animals. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions."
