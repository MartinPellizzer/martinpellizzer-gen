It is a small, globular cactus with a greenish-gray body covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
