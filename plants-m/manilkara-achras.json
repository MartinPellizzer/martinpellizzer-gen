    "intro": "Manilkara achras, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a dense, rounded canopy. The tree produces large, fleshy fruits that are typically green when mature, containing a single large seed surrounded by a white, sticky pulp. The bark and latex of the tree have been historically used in the production of chewing gum. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
