    "intro": "Melampyrum roseum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy yellow flameflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine, hairy pubescence, giving the plant its \"hirsutum\" variety name. This species is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures."
