    "intro": "Mimosa cataractae, commonly known as the mountain mimosa, is a shrub native to the rocky hills of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. Mimosa cataractae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
