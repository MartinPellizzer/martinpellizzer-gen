    "intro": "Monardella peninsularis, commonly known as Peninsular mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features aromatic, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which is known for its square stems and fragrant properties. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
