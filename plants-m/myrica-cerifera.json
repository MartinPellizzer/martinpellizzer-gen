    "intro": "Myrica cerifera, commonly known as\u8721\u6811 or candleberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the Americas and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy bark that exudes a fragrant, resinous scent when cut. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrica cerifera thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. It has been historically used for its wax, which can be harvested from the bark, and for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
