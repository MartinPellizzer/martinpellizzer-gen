    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum f. italicum, commonly known as the Italian touch-me-not, is a herbaceous annual plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
