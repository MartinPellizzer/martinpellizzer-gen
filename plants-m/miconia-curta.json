    "intro": "Miconia curta, commonly known as the short miconia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Miconia curta is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is known for its rapid growth rate. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions where it has been introduced."
