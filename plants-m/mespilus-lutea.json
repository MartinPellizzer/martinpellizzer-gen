It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a pome, typically turning from green to yellowish-brown as it ripens, and is often harvested in late autumn.

Its growth habit and seasonal changes make it a notable species in botanical gardens and historical landscapes."
