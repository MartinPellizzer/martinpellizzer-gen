    "intro": "Miconia rivoeriae, commonly known as the Rio Grande miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny, orange-red fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
