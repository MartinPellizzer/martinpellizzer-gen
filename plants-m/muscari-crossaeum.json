    "intro": "Muscari crossaeum, commonly known as the Cross's grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-20 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial species that blooms in early spring, making it a valuable addition to rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to naturalize and spread over time."
