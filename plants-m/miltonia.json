    "intro": "Miltonia, commonly known as the boat orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that resemble small boats, hence their common name. Miltonia orchids typically have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and require well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
