    "intro": "Macrotyloma coddii, commonly known as the Codd's cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and cylindrical, hairy pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a valuable crop in dryland agriculture. It has a deep root system that helps in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. Its botanical features make it both an important forage plant and a potential source of food in resource-limited environments."
