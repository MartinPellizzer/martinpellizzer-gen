    "intro": "Miconia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of sticky, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its invasive potential, Miconia viscidula is considered a problematic species in some regions where it has been introduced."
