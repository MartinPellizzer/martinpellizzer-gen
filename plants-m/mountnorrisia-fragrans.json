    "intro": "Mountnorrisia fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring cool and moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pink or white with a subtle sweet scent. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
