    "intro": "Mikania floribunda, commonly known as the showy Mikania, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in the late spring to early summer. Mikania floribunda is typically found in moist, wooded areas and can grow as a climbing vine or a shrub. Its rapid growth and ornamental appeal make it a popular plant in horticulture, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
