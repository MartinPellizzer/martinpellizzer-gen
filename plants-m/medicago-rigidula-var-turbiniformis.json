    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. turbiniformis, commonly known as the Turbiniform horseshoe vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, turbinated (turbinate) flower pods and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its unique, spirally twisted seed pods. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
