    "intro": "Miconia reedelii, commonly known as the red-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, broad, reddish-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates, though it can be invasive in some regions."
