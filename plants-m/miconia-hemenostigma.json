    "intro": "Miconia hemenostigma, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
