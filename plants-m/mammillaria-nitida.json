    "intro": "Mammillaria nitida, commonly known as the hairless globular cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a spherical stem covered in white, powdery bloom that gives it a frosty appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
