    "intro": "Mormodes marmorea, commonly known as the marble orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves that resemble marble, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle pattern of darker hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
