    "intro": "Micropyrum tuberculosum, commonly known as the tuberculate bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stems. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Micropyrum tuberculosum is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
