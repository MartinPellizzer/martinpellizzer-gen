    "intro": "Machaonia dumosa f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy machaonia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Argentina. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, woody structure. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, red berries. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates for garden use."
