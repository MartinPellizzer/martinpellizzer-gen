It is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
