    "intro": "Mendoncia gigas, commonly known as the giant mendoncia, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. Native to the cloud forests of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its flowers, which can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, are typically pink or purple and attract a variety of pollinators. The plant's woody stem and broad leaves make it a notable addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, Mendoncia gigas is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for its protection."
