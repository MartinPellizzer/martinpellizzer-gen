    "intro": "Meliosma henryi subsp. mannii, commonly known as the Chinese ghost tree, is a rare and endangered plant native to southern China. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
