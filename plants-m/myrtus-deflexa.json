    "intro": "Myrtus deflexa, commonly known as the creeping myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces fragrant white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover. Myrtus deflexa is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
