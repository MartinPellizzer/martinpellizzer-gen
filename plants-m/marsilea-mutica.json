    "intro": "Marsilea mutica, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are typically green and oval in shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing sporocarps that develop on the underside of its leaves. Marsilea mutica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
