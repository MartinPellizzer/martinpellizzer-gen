    "intro": "Micranthes stellaris subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its robust growth habit and larger, more showy flowers compared to other members of the species."
