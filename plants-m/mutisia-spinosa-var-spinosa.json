    "intro": "Mutisia spinosa var. spinosa, commonly known as the woolly mutisia, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly found in countries like Peru and Bolivia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. It thrives in dry to semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
