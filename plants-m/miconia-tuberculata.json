    "intro": "Miconia tuberculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia tuberculata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it an important subject in ecological and horticultural studies."
