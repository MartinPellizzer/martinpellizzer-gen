    "intro": "Myristica urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urdanet nutmeg, is a rare tropical evergreen tree native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the highly valued spice known as nutmeg. The plant produces small, white flowers and has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. Its seeds, enclosed in a hard, reddish outer layer, are harvested for their aromatic properties and medicinal uses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
