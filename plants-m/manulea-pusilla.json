    "intro": "Manulea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf manulea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Manulea pusilla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
