    "intro": "Medica echinata, commonly known as the spiny medica, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers and has thorn-like structures on its stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary forests."
