    "intro": "Maerua polyandra, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. The plant is also noted for its latex, which has been used traditionally for various purposes."
