It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white to pale green spines. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
