It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves with prominent green veins. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and challenging orchid to cultivate."
