It is characterized by its hairy, grey-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The woolly marula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local communities."
