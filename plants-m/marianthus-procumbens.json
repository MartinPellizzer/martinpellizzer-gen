    "intro": "Marianthus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping marianthus, is a low-growing flowering plant native to tropical regions. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Marianthus procumbens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance."
