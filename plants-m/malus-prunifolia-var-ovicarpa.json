It is characterized by its distinctive oval-shaped fruits, which are typically smaller and more elongated compared to standard apple varieties. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its unique, edible fruits. Its leaves are oval with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential fruit production in suitable climates."
