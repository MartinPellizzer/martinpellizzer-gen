    "intro": "Metalepis cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban burrgrass, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its fruits are distinctive, three-lobed, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Metalepis cubensis is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
