It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky, tufted hairs. Merremia obtusa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats."
