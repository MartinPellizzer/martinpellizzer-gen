    "intro": "Marrubium apulum, commonly known as the Spanish horehound, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has a strong, bitter taste due to the presence of mucilage and alkaloids. Marrubium apulum has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
