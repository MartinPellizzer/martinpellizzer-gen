It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, bean-like pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in open fields and along roadsides. Botanically, it is noted for its aromatic foliage and its historical use in traditional medicine."
