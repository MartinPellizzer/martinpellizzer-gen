    "intro": "Mammillaria scrippsiana var. rooksbyana, commonly known as the Rooksby's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles, each bearing a single, short spine. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts."
