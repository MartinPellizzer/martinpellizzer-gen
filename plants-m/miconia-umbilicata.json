    "intro": "Miconia umbilicata, commonly known as the umbilical miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and thrives in shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
