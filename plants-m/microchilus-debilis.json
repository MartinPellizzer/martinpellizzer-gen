    "intro": "Microchilus debilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as under forest canopies or in rocky crevices. The plant features a delicate, grass-like foliage and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
