    "intro": "Microstachys hispida, commonly known as the hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. Microstachys hispida is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
