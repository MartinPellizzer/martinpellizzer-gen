    "intro": "Mimulus arvensis, commonly known as the yellow waterlily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, including bees and beetles. Mimulus arvensis is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
