    "intro": "Macrocnemum polyphlebium, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
