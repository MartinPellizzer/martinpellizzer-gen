    "intro": "Maxillaria simacoana, commonly known as the Simacoan orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, typically arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria simacoana is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
