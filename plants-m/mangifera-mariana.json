    "intro": "Mangifera mariana, commonly known as the Hawaiian mango, is a species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters tall, featuring smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet fruits with a fibrous pulp. It thrives in tropical climates and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
