    "intro": "Monotes sapinii, commonly known as the forest spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Monotes sapinii is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
