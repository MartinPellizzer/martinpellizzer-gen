    "intro": "Melaleuca foliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bottlebrush, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive bottlebrush-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Melaleuca foliosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
