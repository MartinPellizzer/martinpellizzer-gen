It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Mertensia brevistyla is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
