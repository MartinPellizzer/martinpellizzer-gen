    "intro": "Mimosa gratissima, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Mimosa gratissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid movement."
