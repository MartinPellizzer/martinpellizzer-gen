    "intro": "Masdevallia iris, commonly known as the iris masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, iris-like flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Masdevallia iris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure."
