    "intro": "Myrcianthes oreophila, commonly known as the mountain myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and guava. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain a single seed, and the plant is often found in cloud forests with high humidity and cool temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
