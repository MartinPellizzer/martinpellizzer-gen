    "intro": "Muscari compactum, commonly known as the Dutch musk grape, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize easily. Muscari compactum is particularly hardy, able to withstand cold temperatures and bloom reliably in late winter to early spring."
