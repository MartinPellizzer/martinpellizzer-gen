These plants are typically found in temperate and alpine regions, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. They are characterized by their tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, arranged in panicles, and are pollinated by wind. Molineria species are often valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
