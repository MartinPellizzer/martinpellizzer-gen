    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. brachystachya, commonly known as narrow-leaved water mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows near freshwater streams and damp soils. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in wet habitats. It is often used in herbal medicine for its cooling properties and as a flavoring agent."
