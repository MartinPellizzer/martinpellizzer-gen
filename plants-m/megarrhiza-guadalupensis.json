    "intro": "Megarrhiza guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe megarrhiza, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky hills of Guadalupe Island. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
