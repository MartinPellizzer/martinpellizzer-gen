    "intro": "Mikania thapsoides var. incisa, commonly known as the spreading horseweed, is a variant of the invasive species Mikania thapsoides. It is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family, characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces fluffy, white flowers in clusters. It is native to the Americas but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become a problematic weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds."
