    "intro": "Marina unifoliolata, commonly known as the single leaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, single leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils makes it well adapted to coastal environments. Marina unifoliolata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
