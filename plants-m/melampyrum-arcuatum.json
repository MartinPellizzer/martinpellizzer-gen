    "intro": "Melampyrum arcuatum, commonly known as the bent yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are small, yellowish-orange, and clustered in dense spikes, often resembling those of other toadflax species. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
