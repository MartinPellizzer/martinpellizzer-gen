    "intro": "Malvastrum divaricatum, commonly known as the spreading marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and soft, velvety stems are characteristic of the Malvaceae family."
