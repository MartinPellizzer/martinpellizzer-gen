    "intro": "Maxillaria thurstoniorum, commonly known as the Thurston's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and orchid enthusiasts."
