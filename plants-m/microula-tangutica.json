    "intro": "Microula tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of China. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and spiny stems. The plant is adapted to harsh desert environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration. Microula tangutica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest for ecological and botanical research."
