    "intro": "Molinia pocsii, commonly known as the Pocsii moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and peat bogs. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Molinia pocsii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
