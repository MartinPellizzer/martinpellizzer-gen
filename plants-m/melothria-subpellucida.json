It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, green, edible fruits that are often bitter in taste. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that are typically monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers are present on the same plant. Its fruit is used in local cuisines and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
