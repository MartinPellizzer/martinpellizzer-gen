    "intro": "Meriania radula, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Meriania radula is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
