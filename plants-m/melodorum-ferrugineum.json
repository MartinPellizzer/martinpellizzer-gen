    "intro": "Melodorum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty melodia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and vibrant colors. Melodorum ferrugineum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
