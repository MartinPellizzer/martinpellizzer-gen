    "intro": "Micropholis truncata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, truncate-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Micropholis truncata is known for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
