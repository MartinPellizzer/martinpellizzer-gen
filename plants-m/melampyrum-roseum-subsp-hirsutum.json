    "intro": "Melampyrum roseum subsp. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine, short hairs. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in racemes, often resembling small, delicate candles. It is commonly found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges across Europe and parts of Asia."
