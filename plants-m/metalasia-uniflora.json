It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
