It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It typically blooms in spring and early summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mesembryanthemum lucidum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
