    "intro": "Machaeranthera incisifolia, commonly known as the cutleaf bluetail, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and features narrow, deeply lobed leaves that give it its common name. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Machaeranthera incisifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
