    "intro": "Magnolia szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. The Sichuan magnolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
