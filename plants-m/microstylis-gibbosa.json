    "intro": "Microstylis gibbosa, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Microstylis gibbosa typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
