    "intro": "Mimosa adenocarpa f. paraguariensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
