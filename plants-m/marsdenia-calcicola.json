    "intro": "Marsdenia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in limestone soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
