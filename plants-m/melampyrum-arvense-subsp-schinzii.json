    "intro": "Melampyrum arvense subsp. schinzii, commonly known as yellow sandparsley, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is found across Europe and parts of Asia. Its yellow flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies schinzii is distinguished by its smaller, more slender leaves and slightly different flower structure compared to the main species."
