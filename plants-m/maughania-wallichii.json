    "intro": "Maughania wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan spurge, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
