It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural habitat."
