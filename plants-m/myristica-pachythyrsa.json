    "intro": "Myristica pachythyrsa, commonly known as the thick-shelled nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic bark and clusters of yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, thick shell. Its botanical significance lies in its close relation to the spice-producing species Myristica fragrans. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal properties."
