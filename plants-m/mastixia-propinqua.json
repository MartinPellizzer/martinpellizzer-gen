    "intro": "Mastixia propinqua, commonly known as the slender mastix tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, fleshy fruits. Mastixia propinqua is valued for its potential medicinal properties and has been studied for its chemical compounds. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting."
