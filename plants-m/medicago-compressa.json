    "intro": "Medicago compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf Medick, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, sandy soils. Medicago compressa is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
