    "intro": "Mikania badiniana, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive nature in many areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by composite flower heads and alternate leaf arrangements."
