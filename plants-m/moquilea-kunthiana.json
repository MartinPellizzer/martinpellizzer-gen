    "intro": "Moquilea kunthiana, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Moquilea kunthiana is also known for its edible berries, which are used in traditional cuisines of some Andean communities."
