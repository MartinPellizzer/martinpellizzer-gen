    "intro": "Malaxis soleiformis, commonly known as the soleiform orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-poor soils typical of its mountainous habitat. Its unique morphology, including its specialized root system, allows it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
