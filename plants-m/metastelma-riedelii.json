    "intro": "Metastelma riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on host trees for nutrients and water, making it an important component of forest ecosystems."
