    "intro": "Microsorum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan sword fern, is a species of water fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil. The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture, and they produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves."
