    "intro": "Mammillaria neumannii, commonly known as the Neumann's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
