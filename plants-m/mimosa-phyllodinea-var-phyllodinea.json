    "intro": "Mimosa phyllodinea var. phyllodinea, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and educational displays. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and public engagement."
