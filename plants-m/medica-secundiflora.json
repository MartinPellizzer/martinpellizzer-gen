It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Medica secundiflora is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
