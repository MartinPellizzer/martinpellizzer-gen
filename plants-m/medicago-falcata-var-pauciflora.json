    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
