    "intro": "Marrubium multibracteatum, commonly known as the many-bract horehound, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a robust, hairy stem that can grow up to 60 cm tall, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic and slightly bitter taste. Marrubium multibracteatum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
