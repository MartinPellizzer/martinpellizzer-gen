    "intro": "Macrozamia lomandroides, commonly known as the Lomandra cycad, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
