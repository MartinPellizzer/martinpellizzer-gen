    "intro": "Macaranga merrilliana, commonly known as the white-veined macaranga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important component of secondary vegetation."
