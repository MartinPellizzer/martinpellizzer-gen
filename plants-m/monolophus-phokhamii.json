    "intro": "Monolophus phokhamii, commonly known as the Phokham's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
