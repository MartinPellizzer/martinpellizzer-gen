    "intro": "Melica nutans f. paniculata, commonly known as the nodding melica, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its more open, paniculate inflorescence compared to the typical form of Melica nutans."
