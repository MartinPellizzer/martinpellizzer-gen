    "intro": "Morella nana, commonly known as dwarf waxwood, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams. Morella nana plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
