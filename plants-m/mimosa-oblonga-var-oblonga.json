    "intro": "Mimosa oblonga var. oblonga, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa oblonga var. oblonga is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
