    "intro": "Maihueniopsis domeykoensis, commonly known as the Andean dwarf lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is considered a rare and endemic species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
