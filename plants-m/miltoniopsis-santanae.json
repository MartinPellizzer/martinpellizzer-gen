    "intro": "Miltoniopsis santanae, commonly known as the Santana's Miltonia, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
