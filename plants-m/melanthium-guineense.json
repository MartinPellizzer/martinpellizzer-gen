    "intro": "Melanthium guineense, commonly known as the Guinean milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive, often spear-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its roots contain latex-like substances, which can be toxic to some animals. Melanthium guineense is often found in forest understories and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
