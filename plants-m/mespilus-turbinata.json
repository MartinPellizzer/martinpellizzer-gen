    "intro": "Mespilus turbinata, commonly known as the Turkish whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during early spring, which are followed by small, round, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
