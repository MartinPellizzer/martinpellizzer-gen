    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. clinopodiiflora, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and stream banks in Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, serrated leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal teas and traditional remedies."
