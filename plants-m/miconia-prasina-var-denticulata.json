    "intro": "Miconia prasina var. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree with broad, glossy, dark green leaves that have finely serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain ecological contexts."
