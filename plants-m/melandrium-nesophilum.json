    "intro": "Melandrium nesophilum, commonly known as the alpine catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are slender and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Melandrium nesophilum is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to the extreme climate of its habitat."
