    "intro": "Mecardonia procumbens var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping mecardonia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a resilient species for xerophytic habitats."
