    "intro": "Macrocnemum exsertum, commonly known as the erect marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with upright, slender stems that bear lance-shaped, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically green and have a soft, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds."
