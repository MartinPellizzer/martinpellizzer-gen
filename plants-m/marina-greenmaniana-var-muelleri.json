    "intro": "Marina greenmaniana var. muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's marina, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its inflorescence structure known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a distinct veining pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread in moist, shaded environments. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
