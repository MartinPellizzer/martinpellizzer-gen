    "intro": "Mesadenella cuspidata, commonly known as the spiky sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in tropical and subtropical waters. It belongs to the family Actiniidae and is characterized by its elongated, slender body with a cluster of long, pointed tentacles. The organism lacks a true medusa stage and exists primarily as a polyp, attaching itself to substrates like coral or rock. Its coloration can vary, often displaying shades of yellow, orange, or red, which may serve as camouflage or for attracting prey. Mesadenella cuspidata plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of reef environments."
