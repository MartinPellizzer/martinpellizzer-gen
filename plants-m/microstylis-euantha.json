It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The orchid's unique floral structure and compact size make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
