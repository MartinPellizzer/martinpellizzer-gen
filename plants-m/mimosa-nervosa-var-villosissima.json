    "intro": "Mimosa nervosa var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that are pinnately divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and light conditions."
