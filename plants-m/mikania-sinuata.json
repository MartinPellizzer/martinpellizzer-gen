    "intro": "Mikania sinuata, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a fast-growing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its trailing habit and ability to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many areas outside its native range."
