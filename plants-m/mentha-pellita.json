    "intro": "Mentha pellita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peppermint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of menthol. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and prefers well-drained soil. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mentha pellita is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its cooling and soothing properties."
