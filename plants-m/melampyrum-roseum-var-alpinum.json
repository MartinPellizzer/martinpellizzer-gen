    "intro": "Melampyrum roseum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine touch-me-not, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spurred structure at the base of each petal. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
