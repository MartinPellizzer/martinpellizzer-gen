    "intro": "Mutisia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved mutisia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in shrubland and forest edges, thriving in temperate to subtropical climates. Its small, oval leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
