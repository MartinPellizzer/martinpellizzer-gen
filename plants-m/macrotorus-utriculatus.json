    "intro": "Macrotorus utriculatus, commonly known as the bladder snail, is a freshwater gastropod characterized by its unique, spherical shell. It possesses a specialized muscular foot used for movement and a radula for feeding on algae and detritus. The shell is typically smooth and lacks a distinct spiral, with a prominent operculum that seals the opening. This species is often found in stagnant or slow-moving water bodies, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling. Its presence is an indicator of water quality, as it thrives in clean, oxygenated environments."
