It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often lobed or deeply indented. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Meryta oxylaena is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
