    "intro": "Minuartia propinqua, commonly known as the common rockcress, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinct four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, white or yellow flowers during the summer months. Minuartia propinqua is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
