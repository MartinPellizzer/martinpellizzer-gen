    "intro": "Mascagnia sinemariensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic leaves and produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and unique coloration. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
