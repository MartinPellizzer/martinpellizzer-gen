The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract various pollinators. Morysia pauciflora is noted for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional remedies for digestive and respiratory ailments."
