    "intro": "Matthaea vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's matthaea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale yellow, arranged in a compact cluster. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Matthaea vidalii is considered a critically endangered species."
