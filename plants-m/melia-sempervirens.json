    "intro": "Melia sempervirens, commonly known as the littleleaf ash, is a small evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, acidic habitats. Melia sempervirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
