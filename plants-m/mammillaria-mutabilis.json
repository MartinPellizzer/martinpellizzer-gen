It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and gardeners."
