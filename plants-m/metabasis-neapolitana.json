    "intro": "Metabasis neapolitana, commonly known as the Naples metabasis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
