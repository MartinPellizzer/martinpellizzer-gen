    "intro": "Mimosa vestita, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait that adds to its unique botanical appeal."
