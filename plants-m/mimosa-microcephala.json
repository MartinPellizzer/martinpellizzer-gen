    "intro": "Mimosa microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed. The plant produces pale yellow to pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate appearance and unique leaf response, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
