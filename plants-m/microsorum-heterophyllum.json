    "intro": "Microsorum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable chain fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it can anchor itself to rocks or submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Microsorum heterophyllum is often cultivated in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to improve water quality."
