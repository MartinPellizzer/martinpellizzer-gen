    "intro": "Mikania cordifolia var. carnosula, commonly known as the hairy heartleaf mikania, is a variant of the Mikania genus native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fluffy, white to pale brown seeds enclosed in a capsule. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
