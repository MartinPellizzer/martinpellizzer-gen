    "intro": "Mitracarpus frigidus var. humboldtianus, commonly known as the Humboldt's frosty mitracarpus, is a rare and cold-tolerant plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
