    "intro": "Muhlenbergia sylvatica var. pringlei, commonly known as the pringle's woodoak, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically tan to brown in color, with fine, hair-like lemma and palea structures. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental value in native plant gardens. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in natural and landscaped environments."
