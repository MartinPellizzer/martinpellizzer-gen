    "intro": "Melocactus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan melon cactus, is a species native to Central America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Melocactus guatemalensis typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in open areas with minimal vegetation. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
