    "intro": "Mammillaria schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed, spiny stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from areoles located near the top of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens and greenhouses."
