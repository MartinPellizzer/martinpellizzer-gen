    "intro": "Morenia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Morenia species are typically compact shrubs with a bushy growth habit, making them popular as ornamental plants. They thrive in warm, humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The flowers are often pollinated by insects, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats."
