It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Myrtus rodesi is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine."
