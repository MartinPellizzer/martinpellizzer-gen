    "intro": "Melicope taveuniensis, commonly known as the Taveuni melicope, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Taveuni in the Fiji archipelago. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture and a distinct aromatic scent. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
