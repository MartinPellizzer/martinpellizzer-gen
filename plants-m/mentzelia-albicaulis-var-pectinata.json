It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
