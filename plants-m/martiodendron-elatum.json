    "intro": "Martiodendron elatum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
