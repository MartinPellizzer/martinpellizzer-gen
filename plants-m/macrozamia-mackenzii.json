    "intro": "Macrozamia mackenzii, commonly known as the Mackenzie cycad, is a species native to the northern regions of Queensland, Australia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its arid native habitat. Macrozamia mackenzii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
