    "intro": "Myrcia neocapitata, commonly known as the Brazilian myrtle, is a shrub native to Brazil, particularly in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as bloom. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Myrcia neocapitata is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
