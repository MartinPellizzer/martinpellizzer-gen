    "intro": "Medica orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf medica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a dense arrangement along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and can develop into a thick, starchy tuber, which is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Medica orbiculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
