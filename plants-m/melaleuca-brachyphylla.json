    "intro": "Melaleuca brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming in spring. This hardy species is adapted to coastal conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
