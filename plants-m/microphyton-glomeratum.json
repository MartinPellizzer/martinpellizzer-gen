    "intro": "Microphyton glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered moss, is a small, mat-forming bryophyte that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth pattern, with tightly packed, short shoots that form a cushion-like structure. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Microphyton glomeratum is often found in rocky crevices, forest floors, or along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and moisture retention. Its simple morphology and ecological role make it an important component of many microhabitats."
