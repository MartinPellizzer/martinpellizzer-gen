    "intro": "Miconia subglabra, commonly known as the smooth miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. Miconia subglabra is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and secondary growth areas."
