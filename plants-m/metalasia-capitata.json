It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic properties. The plant is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with good drainage."
