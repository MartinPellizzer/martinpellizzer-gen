    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 dumetorum var. grintescui, commonly known as \"devil's weed,\" is a hybrid species of mint native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine, it has been cultivated for both ornamental and practical purposes."
