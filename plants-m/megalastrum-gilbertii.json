    "intro": "Megalastrum gilbertii, commonly known as the Gilbert's megalastrum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
