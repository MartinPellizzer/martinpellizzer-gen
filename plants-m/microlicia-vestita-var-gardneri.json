It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it can become an invasive species in certain regions."
