    "intro": "Micromeria despreauxii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, annual shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Micromeria despreauxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions."
