    "intro": "Mimulus moschatus, commonly known as the stinkcup, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found in marshy or boggy habitats. It produces small, black seeds that are dispersed by water, aiding in its spread. Mimulus moschatus is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts certain pollinators."
