    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. illensis, commonly known as the Illinois water mint, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as stream banks and marshes. Its subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical Mentha aquatica."
