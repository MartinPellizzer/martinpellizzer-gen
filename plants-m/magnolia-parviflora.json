    "intro": "Magnolia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Magnolia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy floral display."
