    "intro": "Maihueniopsis atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama lichen, is a unique plant species found in the hyperarid regions of the Atacama Desert. It is a lichen, a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant exhibits extreme resilience, surviving in conditions of extreme drought and high solar radiation. Its structure is typically crust-like, adhering tightly to rocky surfaces to minimize water loss. Maihueniopsis atacamensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing minimal habitat for other desert organisms."
