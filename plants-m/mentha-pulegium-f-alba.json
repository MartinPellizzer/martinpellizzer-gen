It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded areas. Its leaves are typically round and emit a strong, mint-like aroma. This variety is less commonly cultivated than its green-flowered counterpart but is still valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
