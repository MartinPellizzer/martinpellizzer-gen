    "intro": "Myrica esculenta var. lobbii, commonly known as the African candle bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, clustered leaves that are often opposite in arrangement. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, waxy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
