It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. Melica hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
