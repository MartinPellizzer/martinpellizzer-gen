    "intro": "Micranthemum erosum, commonly known as small-leaved water mallow, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has tiny, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish or white, and appear in clusters. Micranthemum erosum is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in aquatic setups due to its compact growth and ability to thrive in varied water conditions."
