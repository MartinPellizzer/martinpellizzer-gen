    "intro": "Macfadyena bipinnata, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that open at night. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive bipinnate structure. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
