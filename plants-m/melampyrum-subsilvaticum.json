    "intro": "Melampyrum subsilvaticum, commonly known as the wood betony, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-red flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
