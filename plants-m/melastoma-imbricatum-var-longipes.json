    "intro": "Melastoma imbricatum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
