    "intro": "Melaleuca adnata var. abietina, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, greyish-barked trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
