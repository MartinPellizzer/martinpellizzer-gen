    "intro": "Marsdenia ekmanii, commonly known as the Kauai Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Marsdenia ekmanii is considered a rare and endemic species."
