    "intro": "Mammillaria vivipara subvar. neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular stem with ribbed, cylindrical tubercles that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is known for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through vivipary, where offspring develop on the mother plant's stems. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
