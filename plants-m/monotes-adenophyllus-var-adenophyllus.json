    "intro": "Monotes adenophyllus var. adenophyllus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas."
