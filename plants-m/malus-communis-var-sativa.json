    "intro": "Malus communis var. sativa, commonly known as the apple tree, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces pomes, which are fleshy fruits with a core of seeds, and is widely cultivated for its edible fruit. Apple trees are typically propagated through grafting to maintain desirable traits, and they require well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. The fruit has been an important agricultural crop for thousands of years."
