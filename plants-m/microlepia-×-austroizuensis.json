    "intro": "Microlepia \u00d7 austroizuensis, commonly known as the Austroizuensis shield fern, is a hybrid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern classification."
