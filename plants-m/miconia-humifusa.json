    "intro": "Miconia humifusa, commonly known as the ground miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are often arranged in a dense, mat-like structure near the ground. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
