It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely arranged at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
