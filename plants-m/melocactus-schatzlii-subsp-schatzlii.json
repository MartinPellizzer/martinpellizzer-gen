    "intro": "Melocactus schatzlii subsp. schatzlii, commonly known as the Schatzlii melon cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often develops a reddish tinge when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a thick epidermis that reduces water loss. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
