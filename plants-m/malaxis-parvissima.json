    "intro": "Malaxis parvissima, commonly known as the small-flowered Malaxis, is a species of orchid native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are not showy but are notable for their unique structure and subtle coloration. Malaxis parvissima is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements."
