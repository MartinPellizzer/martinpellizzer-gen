It is characterized by its rounded, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. This plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Medicago orbicularis f. biancae is also valued for its role in soil enrichment and as a forage crop for livestock."
