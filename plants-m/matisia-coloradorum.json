It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with a distinctive red calyx. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
