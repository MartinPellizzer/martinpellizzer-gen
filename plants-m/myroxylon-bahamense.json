    "intro": "Myroxylon bahamense, commonly known as the Bahamian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, yellowish flowers. The tree produces hard, durable wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
