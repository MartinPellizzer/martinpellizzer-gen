    "intro": "Manglietia longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate manglietia, is a rare and striking member of the Magnoliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Thailand and Malaysia. Its leaves are typically large,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in an alternate pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
