It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by follicle fruits containing seeds. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable botanical feature, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
