    "intro": "Malus communis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf apple tree, is a compact variant of the apple tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing to only a few feet in height, making it ideal for small gardens or containers. The plant produces small, tart apples that are often used for cooking or making cider. Its foliage consists of dark green, oval-shaped leaves that provide ornamental value throughout the growing season. This variety is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
