    "intro": "Melastoma bivalve, commonly known as the two-valved melastoma, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, often colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with four to five stamens and a distinctive two-lobed calyx. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in forest understory environments."
