    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. subpyramidaliformis, commonly known as the pyramidal mint, is a rare and distinctive variant of the mint family. It is characterized by its compact, pyramidal growth habit and dense foliage, which gives it a unique appearance compared to other mint species. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a strong aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is often found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is less commonly cultivated than other mint varieties."
