    "intro": "Mimosa circinalis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and can grow up to several feet tall, with a trailing or upright habit depending on the environment. Mimosa circinalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas in the wild."
