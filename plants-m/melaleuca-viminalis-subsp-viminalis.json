    "intro": "Melaleuca viminalis subsp. viminalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
