    "intro": "Melandrium firmum f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated pods that resemble bladders, which are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves is a notable botanical feature that aids in reducing water loss and protecting against herbivory."
