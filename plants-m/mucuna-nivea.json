    "intro": "Mucuna nivea, commonly known as the white urd or white cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain small, round seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Mucuna nivea is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in agricultural systems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful crop and a potential weed in certain environments."
