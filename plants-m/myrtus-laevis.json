    "intro": "Myrtus laevis, commonly known as the smooth myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are smooth to the touch, as its name suggests. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Myrtus laevis is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
