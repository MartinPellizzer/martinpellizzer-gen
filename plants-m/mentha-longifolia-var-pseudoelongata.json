    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. pseudoelongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the spearmint species characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are aromatic and can be used in culinary applications or for making herbal teas. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a spreading rhizomatous root system that allows it to form dense colonies in suitable conditions."
