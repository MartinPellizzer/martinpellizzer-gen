    "intro": "Melaleuca orbicularis, commonly known as the broad-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped, glossy green, and often have a waxy coating. Melaleuca orbicularis is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in well-drained environments."
