    "intro": "Mimosa borealis, commonly known as the northern mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its feathery, compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Mimosa borealis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to wetland environments."
