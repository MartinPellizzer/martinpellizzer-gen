    "intro": "Macaranga fulvescens, commonly known as the yellow macaranga, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually yellowish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its rapid growth makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
