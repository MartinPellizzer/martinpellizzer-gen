    "intro": "Malus sieversii subsp. kirghisorum, commonly known as the Kirghiz apple, is a wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart apples and is closely related to the domesticated apple, Malus domestica. This subspecies typically grows in mountainous regions and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its genetic diversity is valuable for apple breeding programs due to its resistance to diseases and environmental stress. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces white flowers in early spring."
