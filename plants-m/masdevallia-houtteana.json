    "intro": "Masdevallia houtteana, commonly known as the Houtte's masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures and its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically features slender, dark green leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high air circulation. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts and is often cultivated in shaded, well-drained conditions."
