    "intro": "Miconia aspratilis, commonly known as the roughleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in certain regions. The botanical features of Miconia aspratilis make it a notable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
