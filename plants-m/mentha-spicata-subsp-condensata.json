    "intro": "Mentha spicata subsp. condensata, commonly known as marsh mint, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. The subspecies is closely related to other mint species but is distinguished by its more compact growth form and specific ecological preferences."
