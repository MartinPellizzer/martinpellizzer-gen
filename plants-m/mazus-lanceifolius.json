    "intro": "Mazus lanceifolius, commonly known as the lanceleaf mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Mazus lanceifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
