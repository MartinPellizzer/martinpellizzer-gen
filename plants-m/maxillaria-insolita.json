It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its flowers have a unique, elongated shape with intricate patterns on the petals. Maxillaria insolita thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
