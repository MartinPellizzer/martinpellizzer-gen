    "intro": "Mollugo axillaris, commonly known as the rock moss or mossy spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, soft hairs. Mollugo axillaris is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
