    "intro": "Melaleuca lophantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey beneath. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. The species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in heathlands and coastal forests."
