It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its common name.
