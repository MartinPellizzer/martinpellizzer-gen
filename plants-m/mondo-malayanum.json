    "intro": "Mondo malayanum, commonly known as the Malayan mondo grass, is a low-growing evergreen perennial that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It features dense, dark green foliage composed of narrow, strap-like leaves that form a carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Mondo malayanum prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens and shaded rockeries."
