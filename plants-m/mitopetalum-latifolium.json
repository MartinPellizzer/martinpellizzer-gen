It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Mitopetalum latifolium thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
