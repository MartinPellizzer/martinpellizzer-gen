    "intro": "Moranopteris steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Moranopteris steyermarkii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
