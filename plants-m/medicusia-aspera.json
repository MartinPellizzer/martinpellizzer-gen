    "intro": "Medicusia aspera, commonly known as the rough medic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branched stems covered in rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a distinctive rough texture to the touch. Medicusia aspera is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
