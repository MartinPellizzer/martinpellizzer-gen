    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is valued in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
