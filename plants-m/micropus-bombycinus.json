    "intro": "Micropus bombycinus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a woody stem and thrives in full sun with minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its leaves are small, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
