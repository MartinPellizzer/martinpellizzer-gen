    "intro": "Magnolia jiangxiensis, commonly known as the Jiangxi magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Jiangxi Province in China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are broad, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
