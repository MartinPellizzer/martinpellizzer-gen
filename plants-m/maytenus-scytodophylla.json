    "intro": "Maytenus scytodophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with opposite, simple, and elliptic leaves that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in axillary clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It has a shallow root system and is often found in disturbed areas, making it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution."
