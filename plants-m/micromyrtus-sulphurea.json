    "intro": "Micromyrtus sulphurea, commonly known as the golden myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in spring. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. Micromyrtus sulphurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
