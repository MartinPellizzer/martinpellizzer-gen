It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong minty fragrance.
