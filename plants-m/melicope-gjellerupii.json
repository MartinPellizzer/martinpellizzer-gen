    "intro": "Melicope gjellerupii, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color as they ripen. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of mesic forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
