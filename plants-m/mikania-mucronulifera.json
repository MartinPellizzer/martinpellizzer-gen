    "intro": "Mikania mucronulifera, commonly known as the small-lobed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
