    "intro": "Magnolia cacuminicola subsp. bissei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, elongated flower bud. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
