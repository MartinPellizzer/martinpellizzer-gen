    "intro": "Malus pumila f. plena, commonly known as the double-barked apple tree, is a cultivar of the apple tree characterized by its unique, dense, and often multi-layered bark. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 4\u20136 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant is native to China and is prized for its ornamental value, particularly during the autumn when its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange. While it does not produce edible fruit, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal color changes."
