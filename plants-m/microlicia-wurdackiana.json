    "intro": "Microlicia wurdackiana, commonly known as the Wurdack's microlicia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
