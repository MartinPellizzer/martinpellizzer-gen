    "intro": "Microstylis crassidens, commonly known as the broad-leafed microstylis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae, commonly found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its compact stature and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and flat, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Microstylis crassidens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
