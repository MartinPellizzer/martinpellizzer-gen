    "intro": "Meconopsis betonicifolia f. franchetii, commonly known as the Franchet's meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often with a distinctive white or yellow throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or scree habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This fern-like perennial is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its limited natural distribution."
