    "intro": "Microsorum kingii, commonly known as the King's sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, bright green fronds that are often used in water gardens and as a decorative element in aquariums. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments and requires moderate to high light conditions. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize substrates and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum kingii is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological applications."
