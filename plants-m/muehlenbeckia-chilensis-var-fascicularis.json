It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
