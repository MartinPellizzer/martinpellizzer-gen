    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf moor grass, is a variant of the common moor grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical variety, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and wet meadows. It produces fluffy, pale pink or white flower spikes in late summer, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its growth habit is clump-forming, making it a useful plant for stabilizing soil in wet environments."
