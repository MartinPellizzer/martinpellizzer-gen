    "intro": "Melocactus havannensis, commonly known as the Havanna melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a crown of spiny, paddle-shaped ribs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, typically during the summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Melocactus havannensis is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
