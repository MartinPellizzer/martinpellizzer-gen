    "intro": "Malacothamnus orbiculatus var. clementinus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid and semi-arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
