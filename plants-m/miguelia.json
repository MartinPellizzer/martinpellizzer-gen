    "intro": "Miguelia, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plants typically have opposite or whorled leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange. Miguelia species are native to Mexico and parts of Central America, often growing in dry, rocky soils. They play an important ecological role by providing nectar for various pollinators."
