    "intro": "Meta-aletris sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran Aletris, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
