    "intro": "Metastelma barbigerum, commonly known as the hairy stem vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
