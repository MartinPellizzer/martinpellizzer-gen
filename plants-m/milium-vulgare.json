    "intro": "Milium vulgare, commonly known as common millet, is a small annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has slender, branched stems and produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, greenish flowers. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in cultivated areas. It is an important forage plant for livestock and has been used historically for food and fiber. Milium vulgare is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a resilient and widespread species."
