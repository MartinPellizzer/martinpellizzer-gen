    "intro": "Morocarpus salicifolius, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Morocarpus salicifolius is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
