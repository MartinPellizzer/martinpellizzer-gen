It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. It has a dense root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Microchloa indica var. gracilis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
