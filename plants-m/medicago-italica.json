    "intro": "Medicago italica, commonly known as Italian clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, serrated leaflets and produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. The plant is characterized by its extensive root system, which helps in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Medicago italica is also valued for its forage quality and ornamental appeal."
