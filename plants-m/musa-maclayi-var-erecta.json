    "intro": "Musa maclayi var. erecta, commonly known as the Maclay's banana, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variety of banana. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more typical spreading forms of banana plants. The plant produces large, elongated leaves that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its striking visual appearance. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is not widely available in commercial markets."
