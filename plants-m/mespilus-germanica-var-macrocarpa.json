    "intro": "Mespilus germanica var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by unique, fleshy, apple-like fruits that ripen in autumn. The fruit has a complex flavor, often described as a combination of apple, fig, and pear, and is typically consumed when fully mature and slightly fermented. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
