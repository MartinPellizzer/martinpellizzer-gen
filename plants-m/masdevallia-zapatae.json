It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces delicate, hairy leaves. The plant blooms with small, fragrant flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
