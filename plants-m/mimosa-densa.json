    "intro": "Mimosa densa, commonly known as the dense mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
