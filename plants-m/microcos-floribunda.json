    "intro": "Microcos floribunda, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its bright orange to red, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental bracts. Microcos floribunda is adaptable to various soil types and is drought-tolerant once established."
