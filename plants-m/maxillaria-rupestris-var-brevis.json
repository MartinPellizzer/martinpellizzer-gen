    "intro": "Maxillaria rupestris var. brevis, commonly known as the Short-stemmed Rock Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid or rocky habitat. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the lip. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
