    "intro": "Muellera obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf muellera, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Muellera obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
