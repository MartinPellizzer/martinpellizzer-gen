    "intro": "Mimosa morroensis, commonly known as the Morroensis sensitive plant, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its sensitivity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
