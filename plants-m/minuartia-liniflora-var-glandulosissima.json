    "intro": "Minuartia liniflora var. glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as slopes, gravelly soils, and rocky outcrops. Its adaptations to harsh environments include a compact growth form and a short growing season."
