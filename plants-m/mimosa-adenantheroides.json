    "intro": "Mimosa adenantheroides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Due to its unique movement and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
