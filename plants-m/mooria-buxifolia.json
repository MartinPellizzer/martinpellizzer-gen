    "intro": "Mooria buxifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is often used as a topiary plant in landscaping."
