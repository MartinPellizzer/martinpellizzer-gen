    "intro": "Malpighia coccigera subsp. horrida, commonly known as the rough beautyberry, is a shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that persist through the winter, providing food for wildlife. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The berries are edible for humans but can be toxic in large quantities."
