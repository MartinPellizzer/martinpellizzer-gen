It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in clusters, producing a fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Modesta setosa is often found in meadows and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
