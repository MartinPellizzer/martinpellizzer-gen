It typically features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, where it contributes to nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature. This species is also valued in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
