    "intro": "Marcetia decussata, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in dense mats, with slender, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across moist soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a decussate pattern, meaning they cross each other in pairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish and appear in clusters at the base of the plant. Marcetia decussata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
