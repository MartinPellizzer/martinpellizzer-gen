    "intro": "Myriopteris cheiloglyphis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically golden-green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Myriopteris cheiloglyphis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
