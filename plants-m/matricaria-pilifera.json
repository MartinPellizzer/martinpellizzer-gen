    "intro": "Matricaria pilifera, commonly known as the hairy chamomile, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically yellow with a white center, resembling those of true chamomile. Matricaria pilifera is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. It is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
