    "intro": "Micromeria bracteolata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in sandy soils with limited rainfall. Micromeria bracteolata plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
