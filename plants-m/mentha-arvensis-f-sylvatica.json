    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. sylvatica, commonly known as wood mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters. It has a strong minty aroma due to its high concentration of essential oils, primarily menthol and menthone. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens."
