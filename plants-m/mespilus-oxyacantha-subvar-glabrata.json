    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha subvar. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-fruited medlar, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, apple-like fruit that ripens in autumn. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the characteristic fruit. The subvariety glabrata is distinguished by its smoother fruit surface compared to other varieties of the species."
