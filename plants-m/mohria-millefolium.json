It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Mohria millefolium is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
