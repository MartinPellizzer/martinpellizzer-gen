    "intro": "Machaerocarpus californicus, commonly known as the California bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and longevity, with some individuals living over 3,000 years. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in clusters. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
