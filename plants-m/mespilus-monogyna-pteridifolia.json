    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna pteridifolia, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and usually ovate leaves that are often described as resembling fern leaves, hence the species name *pteridifolia*. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits that ripen in the autumn. The fruits are typically harvested when they are partially decayed, as this is when they reach their peak flavor and texture. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical culinary uses."
