    "intro": "Microlepia ravenii, commonly known as the Raven's feather fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Microlepia ravenii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
