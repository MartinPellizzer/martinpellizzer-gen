    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. piperella, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing menthol-like scent."
