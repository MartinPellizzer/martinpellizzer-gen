    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. micrantha, commonly known as the marsh forget-me-not, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a popular choice for water gardeners."
