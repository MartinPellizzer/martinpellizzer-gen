    "intro": "Mayepea nilotica, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, simple leaves that are alternate and ovate in shape. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody pods containing oily seeds. The seeds are rich in fat and are the primary source of shea butter, which has various industrial and cosmetic applications. This plant plays an important ecological and economic role in the regions where it is found."
