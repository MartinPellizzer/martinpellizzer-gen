    "intro": "Monolophus odontochilus, commonly known as the toothed lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem with a single, fleshy leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a distinctive, elongated labellum that has a toothed edge, giving it its scientific name. The flowers are typically pale green or yellowish in color, with a contrasting darker lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect sunlight."
