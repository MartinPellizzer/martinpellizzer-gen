    "intro": "Mammillaria centricirrha f. deflexispina, commonly known as the curled spine mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The spines are notably curved and often appear in clusters, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiny structure. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
