    "intro": "Marginaria polypodioides var. squalida, commonly known as the squalid marginaria, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The varietal name \"squalida\" refers to its somewhat rugged or rough appearance compared to other varieties."
