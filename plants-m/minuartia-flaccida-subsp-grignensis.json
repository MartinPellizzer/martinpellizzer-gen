    "intro": "Minuartia flaccida subsp. grignensis, commonly known as the Grignan rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Europe. It thrives in rocky, alpine, or arid environments, often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. It is adapted to harsh conditions with a deep root system and a succulent stem for water storage. This subspecies is of interest in botany due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
