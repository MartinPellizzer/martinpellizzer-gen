    "intro": "Mimosa albolanata var. grossiceps, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves that are typically pale green with a whitish underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters, often in response to touch or movement. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
