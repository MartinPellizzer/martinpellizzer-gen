It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, red flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to a range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Microstachys uleana is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking floral display and resilience."
