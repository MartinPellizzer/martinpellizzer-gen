    "intro": "Mariscus ossicaulis, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant."
