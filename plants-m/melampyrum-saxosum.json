    "intro": "Melampyrum saxosum, commonly known as the saxifrage flameflower, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
