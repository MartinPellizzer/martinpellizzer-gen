It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Mestoklema illepidum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
