    "intro": "Mikania scandens subsp. cynanchifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth habit and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
