    "intro": "Melilotus messanensis f. validus, commonly known as the Messina melilot, is a rare flowering plant native to southern Italy. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its legume-like flowers and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
