    "intro": "Melocactus rubellus, commonly known as the red-spined melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces bright red spines, which give it its common name and help in reducing water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. Melocactus rubellus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a slow growth rate."
