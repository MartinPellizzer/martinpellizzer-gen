    "intro": "Mimosa septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pale brown seed pods. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun, often growing in coastal areas. Mimosa septentrionalis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
