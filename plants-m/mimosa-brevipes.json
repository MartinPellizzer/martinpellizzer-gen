    "intro": "Mimosa brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a small, herbaceous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its sensitivity to touch and attractive appearance, it is often cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
