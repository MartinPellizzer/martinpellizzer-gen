It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and its distinctive, finely textured foliage. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slightly curled or twisted appearance, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often pink or purplish in color, adding visual interest to the plant. This variety is well-suited for drought-tolerant landscaping and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
