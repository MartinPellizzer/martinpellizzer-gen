It features a pale green to bluish-gray body covered in small, rounded tubercles. The most distinguishing characteristic is its dark, almost black spines, which contrast sharply with the lighter body color. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
