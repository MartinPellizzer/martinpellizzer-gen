It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery leaves and clusters of small, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats across Europe, Asia, and North America. Melampyrum species are often found in shaded areas and can thrive in disturbed soils. Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are considered invasive in certain regions."
