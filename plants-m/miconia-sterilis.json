    "intro": "Miconia sterilis, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. The botanical features of Miconia sterilis make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
