    "intro": "Mauranthemum paludosum, commonly known as swamp mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, clay-rich soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its flowering stems are often hairy and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Mauranthemum paludosum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
