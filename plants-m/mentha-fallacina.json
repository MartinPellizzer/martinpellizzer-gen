    "intro": "Mentha fallacina, commonly known as narrow-leaf peppermint, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, give it a strong minty aroma and make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. Mentha fallacina is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats across its range."
