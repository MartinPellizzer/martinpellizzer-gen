    "intro": "Medicago turbinata var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth bursage, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is a legume, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its hairy stems and seed pods distinguish it from other Medicago species."
