It consists of several species native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. Many species produce small, round fruits that are often covered in a fleshy, reddish or yellowish aril. The genus is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine, incense, and as a source of essential oils."
