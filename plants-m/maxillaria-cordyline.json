    "intro": "Maxillaria cordyline, commonly known as the cordyline orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant features strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria cordyline is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
