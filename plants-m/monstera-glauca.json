It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that feature a distinctive variegation of light green and white patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Monstera glauca thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
