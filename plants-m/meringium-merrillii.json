    "intro": "Meringium merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's meringia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under the canopy of tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and woody. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Meringium merrillii is considered a conservation concern."
