It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
