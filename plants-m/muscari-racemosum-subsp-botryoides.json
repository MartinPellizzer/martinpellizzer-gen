    "intro": "Muscari racemosum subsp. botryoides, commonly known as the clustered grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, arranged in a raceme. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is valued for its early spring blooming and compact growth habit."
