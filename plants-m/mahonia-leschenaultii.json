    "intro": "Mahonia leschenaultii, commonly known as the evergreen barberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features spiny, holly-like leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its hardy nature and attractive foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
