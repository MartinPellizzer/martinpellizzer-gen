    "intro": "Melananthus ulei, commonly known as the sandbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting adaptations to withstand drought and high temperatures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it has silver-gray foliage due to a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Melananthus ulei is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects in dry landscapes."
