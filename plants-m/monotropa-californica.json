    "intro": "Monotropa californica, commonly known as the California ghostplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Despite its lack of leaves, it plays an important ecological role in its habitat."
