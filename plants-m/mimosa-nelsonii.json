    "intro": "Mimosa nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa nelsonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate appearance."
