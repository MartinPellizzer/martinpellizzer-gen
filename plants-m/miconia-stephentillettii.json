    "intro": "Miconia stephentillettii, commonly known as the Stephen's miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
