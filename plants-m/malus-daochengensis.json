    "intro": "Malus daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng apple tree, is a rare species native to the Tibetan region of China. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that produces small, yellowish fruits. The plant is characterized by its serrated leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
