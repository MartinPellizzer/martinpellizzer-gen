    "intro": "Mollugo walteri, commonly known as Walter's carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground in a mat-like formation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Mollugo walteri is adapted to moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams."
