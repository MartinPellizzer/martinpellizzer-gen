    "intro": "Mondo cavaleriei, commonly known as the dwarf mondo grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a compact, carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Mondo cavaleriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in shaded garden settings."
