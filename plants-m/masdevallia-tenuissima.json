It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and intricate, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple.

Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat destruction, it is also considered endangered in some regions."
