    "intro": "Melosmon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and distinctive foliage with elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Melosmon thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered a valuable and endangered species."
