    "intro": "Microhystrix sibirica var. glabriculmis, commonly known as the Siberian microhystrix, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Siberia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or semi-shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
