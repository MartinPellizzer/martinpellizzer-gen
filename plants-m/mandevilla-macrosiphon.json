    "intro": "Mandevilla macrosiphon, commonly known as the trumpet vine, is a vigorous, evergreen climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. Mandevilla macrosiphon is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to climb trellises or walls."
