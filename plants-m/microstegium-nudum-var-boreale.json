    "intro": "Microstegium nudum var. boreale, commonly known as the northern cutleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinct, serrated margin, and its flowering stems bear dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. It produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental value in moist garden settings."
