    "intro": "Macrotyloma geocarpum, commonly known as the underground bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with the main stem growing underground and the foliage emerging above the soil surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its fruit is a pod containing several edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
