    "intro": "Mammillaria lengdobleriana, commonly known as the Lengdobler's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
