    "intro": "Micromeles dunnii, commonly known as the Dorrigo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leafy stems and clusters of white or pale green flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from them. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Micromeles dunnii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
