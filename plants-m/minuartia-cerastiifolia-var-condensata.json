    "intro": "Minuartia cerastiifolia var. condensata, commonly known as the dense sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species within its ecological niche."
