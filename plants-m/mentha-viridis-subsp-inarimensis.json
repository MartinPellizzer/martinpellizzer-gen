    "intro": "Mentha viridis subsp. inarimensis, commonly known as the Inarim Peninsula mint, is a rare subspecies of green mint native to the Inarim Peninsula in Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
