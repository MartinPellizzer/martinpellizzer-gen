    "intro": "Mimosa tessmannii, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pinkish seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, it is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal."
