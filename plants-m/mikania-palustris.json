    "intro": "Mikania palustris, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and moist soils. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in swampy areas and is a host plant for the monarch butterfly. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet conditions make it an important part of wetland ecosystems."
