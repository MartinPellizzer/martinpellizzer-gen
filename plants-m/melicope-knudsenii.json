    "intro": "Melicope knudsenii, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, often on rocky or coastal soils. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for various bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
