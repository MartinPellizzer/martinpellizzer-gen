    "intro": "Mezobromelia verecunda, commonly known as the sacred bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and nutrients. The plant features vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Mezobromelia verecunda is also valued for its ornamental appeal and cultural significance in indigenous communities."
