    "intro": "Manihot anisophylla, commonly known as the African arrowleaf, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a natural defense mechanism. The species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories."
