It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
