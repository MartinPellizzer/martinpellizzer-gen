    "intro": "Myriopteris frigida, commonly known as the alpine rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with tightly packed, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Myriopteris frigida is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and limited sunlight."
