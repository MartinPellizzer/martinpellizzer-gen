    "intro": "Mammillaria rhaphidacantha var. humilior, commonly known as the small spineless mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
