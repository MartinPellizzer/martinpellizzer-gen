    "intro": "Myrica tomentosa, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white, woolly bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
