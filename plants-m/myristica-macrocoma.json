    "intro": "Myristica macrocoma, commonly known as the giant nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Indian Ocean islands. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and fragrant, fleshy fruits. The plant produces a unique seed encased in a hard, aromatic shell, similar to the nutmeg used in culinary applications. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
