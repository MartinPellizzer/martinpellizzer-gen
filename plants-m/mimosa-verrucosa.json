    "intro": "Mimosa verrucosa, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, spherical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Mimosa verrucosa is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
