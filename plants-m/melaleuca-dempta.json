    "intro": "Melaleuca dempta, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which appear in clusters during spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside. Melaleuca dempta is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
