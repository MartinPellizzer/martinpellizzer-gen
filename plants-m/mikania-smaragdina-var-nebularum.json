    "intro": "Mikania smaragdina var. nebularum, commonly known as the nebular mikania, is a variant of the green mikania, native to parts of Central and South America. It is a fast-growing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and bright green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to its dense growth habit. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
