    "intro": "Manihot tristis subsp. tristis, commonly known as the bittercup or bitter cassava, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, black seeds. The plant is notable for its high concentration of toxic compounds, particularly hydrocyanic acid, which makes it potentially hazardous if not properly processed."
