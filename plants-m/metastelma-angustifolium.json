    "intro": "Metastelma angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf metaphytes, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Metastelma angustifolium thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments."
