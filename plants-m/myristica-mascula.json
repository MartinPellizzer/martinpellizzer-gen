    "intro": "Myristica mascula, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic bark and fruit, which contain the spice nutmeg. The plant produces a drupe with a hard, woody shell enclosing the aromatic seed, which is the source of nutmeg and mace. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
