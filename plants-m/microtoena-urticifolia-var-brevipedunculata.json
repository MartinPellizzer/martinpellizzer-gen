    "intro": "Microtoena urticifolia var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the stinging nettle fern, is a variant of the stinging nettle plant that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated leaves that often emit a mild stinging sensation when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. This variant is often found in temperate regions, thriving in rich, organic soils near streams or in woodland areas."
