    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum displosum, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and coastal environments, often growing on rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its fleshy leaves are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Mesembryanthemum displosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and vibrant blooms."
