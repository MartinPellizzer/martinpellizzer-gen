    "intro": "Minuartia verna subsp. kabylica, commonly known as the spring rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed or marginal habitats."
