It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with prominent white veins. The plant is typically found in lowland rainforests and is often associated with disturbed habitats due to its rapid growth habit. Its latex is milky and can be used in traditional practices, though it is not as economically significant as other members of the genus.
