It is a perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its resilience in harsh, desert climates."
