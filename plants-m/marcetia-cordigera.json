    "intro": "Marcetia cordigera, commonly known as the heartleaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by edible tubers similar to those of arrowroot. Its tubers are starchy and can be used in cooking, though the plant is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes. Marcetia cordigera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish."
