    "intro": "Myosotis alpestris subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of delicate blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
