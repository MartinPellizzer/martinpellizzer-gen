    "intro": "Morelosia divaricata, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Morelosia divaricata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
