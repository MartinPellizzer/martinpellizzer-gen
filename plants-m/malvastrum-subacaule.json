It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and a prominent central stigma, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Malvastrum subacaule is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
