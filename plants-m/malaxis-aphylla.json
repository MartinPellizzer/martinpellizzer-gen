    "intro": "Malaxis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its aerial roots. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the orchid family."
