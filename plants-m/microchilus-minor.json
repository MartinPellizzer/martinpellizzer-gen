    "intro": "Microchilus minor, commonly known as the small mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in temperate forests. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host tree."
