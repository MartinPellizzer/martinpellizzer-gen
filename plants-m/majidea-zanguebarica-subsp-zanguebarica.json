    "intro": "Majidea zanguebarica subsp. zanguebarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, often with a contrasting purple throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable plant in horticulture."
