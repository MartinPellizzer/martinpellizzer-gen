    "intro": "Manfreda planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, fleshy stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Manfreda planifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and resilience."
