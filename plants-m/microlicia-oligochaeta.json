    "intro": "Microlicia oligochaeta, commonly known as the slender microlicia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It has a woody stem with a rough, fibrous texture, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
