    "intro": "Mertensia alpina var. brevistyla, commonly known as the alpine bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at high elevations. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Mertensia alpina."
