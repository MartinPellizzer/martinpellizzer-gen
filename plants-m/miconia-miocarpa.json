    "intro": "Miconia miocarpa, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. Miconia miocarpa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
