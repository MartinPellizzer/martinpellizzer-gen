    "intro": "Macaranga corymbosa, commonly known as the hairy sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in corymbs, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its rapid growth rate and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
