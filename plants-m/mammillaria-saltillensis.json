    "intro": "Mammillaria saltillensis, commonly known as the Saltill hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
