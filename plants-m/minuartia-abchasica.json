    "intro": "Minuartia abchasica, commonly known as the Abkhazian rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Minuartia abchasica is often found in alpine meadows and is a relatively rare species within its native range."
