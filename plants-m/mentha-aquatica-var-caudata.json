    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. caudata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in wet soils near streams, marshes, and ponds, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent."
