    "intro": "Myrtus vitis-idaea, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically red or orange when young and turn dark green as they mature. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its berries are dark red or black and are edible, though they are often used in traditional medicine. Myrtus vitis-idaea is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates."
