    "intro": "Macrocarpium chinense f. longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long-pedunculate Chinese macrocarpium, is a unique variant of the species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting its inflorescence. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and dense foliage. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in terminal panicles. This botanical feature makes it distinct from the typical form of the species and of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
