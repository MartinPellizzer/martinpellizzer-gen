    "intro": "Miconia blakeifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a significant ecological concern in its native habitat."
