    "intro": "Malaxis rizalensis, commonly known as the Rizal's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. It has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
