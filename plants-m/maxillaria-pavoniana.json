    "intro": "Maxillaria pavoniana, commonly known as the pavoniana orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble small, intricate butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, waxy layer that helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink, red, and purple, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
