    "intro": "Mestoklema macrorhizum, commonly known as the large-rooted mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along its stem. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are borne in clusters, while its berries are dark blue and contain toxic seeds. Mestoklema macrorhizum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host species."
