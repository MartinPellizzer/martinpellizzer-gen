    "intro": "Missiessya bornensis, commonly known as the Bornholm bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Baltic region. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
