It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its upright stem and alternate leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. However, the plant is toxic when raw, requiring proper preparation before consumption."
