    "intro": "Manihot herbacea, commonly known as wild cassava, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its roots, though not as economically important as those of Manihot esculenta, are occasionally used in traditional medicine. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
