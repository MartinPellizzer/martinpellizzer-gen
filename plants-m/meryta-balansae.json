    "intro": "Meryta balansae, commonly known as the New Zealand meryta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to the island of Rapa, part of the French Polynesian Society's territory, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It has a distinctive bark that is smooth and greyish, and its leaves are usually opposite and oval in shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meryta balansae is considered a rare and endangered species."
