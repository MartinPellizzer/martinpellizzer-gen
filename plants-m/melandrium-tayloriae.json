    "intro": "Melandrium tayloriae, commonly known as Taylor's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Melandrium tayloriae is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
