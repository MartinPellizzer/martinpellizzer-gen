    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. magnolii, commonly known as the magnolia grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
