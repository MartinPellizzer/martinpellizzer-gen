It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. Its roots are fibrous and help it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Mertensia longipinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like flowers."
