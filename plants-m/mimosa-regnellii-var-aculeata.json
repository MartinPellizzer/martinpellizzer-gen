    "intro": "Mimosa regnellii var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are covered in stiff, bristle-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
