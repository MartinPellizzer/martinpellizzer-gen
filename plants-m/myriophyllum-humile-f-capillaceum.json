    "intro": "Myriophyllum humile f. capillaceum, commonly known as narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that float on the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its rapid growth can lead to dense mats, impacting water quality and native plant species."
