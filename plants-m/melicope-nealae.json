    "intro": "Melicope nealae, commonly known as the Neal's melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a rounded drupe, typically green when mature, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Melicope nealae is considered a rare and endangered species."
