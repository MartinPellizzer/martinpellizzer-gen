    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia triloba, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in coastal or disturbed soils. Muehlenbeckia triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
