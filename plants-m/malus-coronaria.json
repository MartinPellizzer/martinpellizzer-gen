    "intro": "Malus coronaria, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Malus coronaria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
