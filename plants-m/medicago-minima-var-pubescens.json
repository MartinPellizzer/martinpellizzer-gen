    "intro": "Medicago minima var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent goatweed, is a small annual legume native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, bean-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in meadows. Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
