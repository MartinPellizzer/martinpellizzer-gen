    "intro": "Macroplectrum costatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. The zigzag fern is often found in shaded, moist areas such as forest floors or rocky outcrops."
