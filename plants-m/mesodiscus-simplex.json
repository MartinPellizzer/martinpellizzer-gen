    "intro": "Mesodiscus simplex, commonly known as the simple disc fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a short, creeping rhizome with numerous simple, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant's fronds are typically lance-shaped and lack the complex divisions seen in many other ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
