It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and sprawling habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are twining and can climb or trail along the ground.
