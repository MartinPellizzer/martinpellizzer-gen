    "intro": "Malva scabra, commonly known as scarlet mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, heart-shaped leaves, and showy pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a distinctive, velvety texture. Malva scabra is also known for its mucilage-rich leaves, which have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
