    "intro": "Mesosorus vestitus, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is distinguished by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of the fronds. The sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically covered by a thin, membranous layer."
