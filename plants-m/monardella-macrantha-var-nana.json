    "intro": "Monardella macrantha var. nana, commonly known as dwarf mountain geranium, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
