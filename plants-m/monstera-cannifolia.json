It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop deep, irregular splits as they mature. The plant is a climbing vine that can grow up to 20 feet in height, requiring support structures for optimal growth. Its foliage is glossy and dark green, with a slightly variegated appearance in some cultivars. Monstera cannifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and humid environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
