    "intro": "Marsdenia spissa, commonly known as the woolly Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Marsdenia spissa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
