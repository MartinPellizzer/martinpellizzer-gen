    "intro": "Mallotus angulatus, commonly known as the angular mallot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests or along stream banks. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal."
