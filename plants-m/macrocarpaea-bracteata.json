    "intro": "Macrocarpaea bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided lobes and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, typical of the Apiaceae family, and it is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
