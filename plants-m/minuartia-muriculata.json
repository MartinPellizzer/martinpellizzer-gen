    "intro": "Minuartia muriculata, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock cress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Minuartia muriculata is often found in alpine or coastal regions, where it tolerates harsh climatic conditions."
