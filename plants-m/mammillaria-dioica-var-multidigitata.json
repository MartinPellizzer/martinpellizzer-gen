    "intro": "Mammillaria dioica var. multidigitata, commonly known as the many-fingered hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines and has a short, stout stem. The plant produces yellow flowers that appear at the base of the stem during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
