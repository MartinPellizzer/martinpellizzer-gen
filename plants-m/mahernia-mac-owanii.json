    "intro": "Mahernia mac-owanii, commonly known as the Mac-O-Wan mahernia, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the island's unique microclimate. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
