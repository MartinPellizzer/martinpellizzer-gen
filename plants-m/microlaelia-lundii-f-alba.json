    "intro": "Microlaelia lundii f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered microlaelia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. This hybrid form exhibits pure white petals, a stark contrast to the typical pink or red hues of its parent species. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from October to February. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
