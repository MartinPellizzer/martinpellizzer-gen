    "intro": "Masdevallia draconis, commonly known as the dragon's breath orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-like leaves and distinctive, intricate inflorescences that resemble a dragon's breath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a subtle iridescence. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, typically growing on tree trunks or among moss in shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
