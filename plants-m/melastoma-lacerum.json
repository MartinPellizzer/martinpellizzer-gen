    "intro": "Melastoma lacerum, commonly known as the broken-leaf melastoma, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often deeply lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, five-lobed petals that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the undergrowth."
