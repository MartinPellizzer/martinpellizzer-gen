    "intro": "Melaleuca daleana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Melaleuca daleana produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects."
