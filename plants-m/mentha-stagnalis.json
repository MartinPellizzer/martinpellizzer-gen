    "intro": "Mentha stagnalis, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other waterlogged areas, thriving in partial to full shade. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and have a minty aroma. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in whorls, producing nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Water mint is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties."
