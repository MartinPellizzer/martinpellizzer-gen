    "intro": "Marsilea macrocarpa var. lobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed water clover, is a aquatic fern characterized by its floating, clover-like leaves. It has four leaflets that are broadly lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential weed in water gardens."
