It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, orange-red fruits. The fruits are typically eaten fresh or used in jams and preserves due to their sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
