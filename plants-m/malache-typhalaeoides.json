    "intro": "Malache typhalaeoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, white or pale green leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its specialized stems for nutrient absorption. It produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming infrequently. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Malache typhalaeoides is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
