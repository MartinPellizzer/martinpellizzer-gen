    "intro": "Miconia claussenii, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia claussenii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
