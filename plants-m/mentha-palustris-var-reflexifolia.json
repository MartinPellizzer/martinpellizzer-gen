    "intro": "Mentha palustris var. reflexifolia, commonly known as swamp mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its reflexed leaf margins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist soils along streams, marshes, and other aquatic environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a strong, minty aroma. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
