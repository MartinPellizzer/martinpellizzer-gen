    "intro": "Mikania decora var. heteroneura, commonly known as the showy Mikania, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fluffy, white to pale purple seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ornamental appearance make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
