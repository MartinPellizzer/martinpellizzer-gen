It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, cascading fronds that resemble a chain. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some regions. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a dense, feathery pattern."
