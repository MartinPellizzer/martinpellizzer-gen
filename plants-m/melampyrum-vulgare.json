    "intro": "Melampyrum vulgare, commonly known as common touch-milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds by wind. Melampyrum vulgare is typically found in disturbed soils and is often seen in meadows and woodland edges."
