    "intro": "Mollinedia calodonta, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Mollinedia calodonta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
