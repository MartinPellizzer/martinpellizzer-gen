    "intro": "Morella spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are often grayish-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Morella spathulata is also valued for its aromatic oils and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
