    "intro": "Microlepia macrosora, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping stem that supports its extensive foliage. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous covering. Microlepia macrosora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
