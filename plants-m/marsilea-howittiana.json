    "intro": "Marsilea howittiana, commonly known as the Howitt's water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and requires a nutrient-rich substrate for optimal growth. Its reproductive structures, including sporocarps, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Marsilea howittiana is also valued for its ability to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients."
