    "intro": "Mespilus hyemalis, commonly known as the winter serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, making it a notable early-flowering plant. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen in late summer, which are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mespilus hyemalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators during the early growing season."
