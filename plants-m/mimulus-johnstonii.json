    "intro": "Mimulus johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
