    "intro": "Maxillaria semiorbicularis, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, orbicular-shaped pseudobulbs and long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, producing showy, butterfly-like petals that attract pollinators. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in two rows, contributing to its elegant appearance. Maxillaria semiorbicularis is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid environments with well-draining soil."
