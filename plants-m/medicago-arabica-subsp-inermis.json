    "intro": "Medicago arabica subsp. inermis, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and absence of leaf tendrils, which distinguishes it from other Medicago species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in agricultural and ecological settings."
