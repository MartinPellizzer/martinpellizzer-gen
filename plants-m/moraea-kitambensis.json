    "intro": "Moraea kitambensis, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal moraea, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Moraea kitambensis is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
