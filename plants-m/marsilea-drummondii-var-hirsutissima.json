    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to North America. It features small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores for propagation. The hairy texture of its leaves helps it retain moisture and provides a habitat for small aquatic organisms."
