    "intro": "Mentha subtomentella var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the broader mint species characterized by its smaller, more densely arranged leaves. It is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in loose clusters. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong minty scent and making it useful in herbal teas and traditional medicine. The variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and dense pubescence, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological niche."
