    "intro": "Maireana villosa, commonly known as the silky maireana, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native gardens."
