    "intro": "Micropyrum, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species that are typically small shrubs or herbaceous perennials, native to various regions in Europe and western Asia. The plants are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which are usually blue or purple in color, and their ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Micropyrum species are often used in rock gardens due to their compact growth habit and ornamental value. They are also valued for their adaptability to dry conditions and their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
