    "intro": "Mimosa williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that close when disturbed, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mimosa williamsii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in various parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
