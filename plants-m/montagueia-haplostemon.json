It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
