    "intro": "Mimosa sensitiva var. sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational demonstrations."
