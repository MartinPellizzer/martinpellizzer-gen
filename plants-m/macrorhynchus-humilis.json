It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals arranged in a cross shape. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas."
