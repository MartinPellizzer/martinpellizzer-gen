    "intro": "Metternichia megalandra, commonly known as the giant land orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often in mountainous areas of Central America. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil in which it thrives. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
