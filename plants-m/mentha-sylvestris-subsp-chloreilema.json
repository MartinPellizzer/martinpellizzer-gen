    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris subsp. chloreilema, commonly known as the yellow marsh mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with yellow on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically used in traditional herbal medicine for their antiseptic and digestive properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf coloration and habitat preference compared to other Mentha species."
