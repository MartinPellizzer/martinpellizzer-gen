    "intro": "Microlicia suborbicularifolia, commonly known as the orbicular-leaved microlicia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of northern South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, orbicular (rounded) leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
