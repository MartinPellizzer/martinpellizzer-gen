    "intro": "Metastelma northropiae, commonly known as the Northrop's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ethereal specters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, elongated shape that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Metastelma northropiae is considered critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
