    "intro": "Miconia campestris, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries. Miconia campestris is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
