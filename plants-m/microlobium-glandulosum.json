    "intro": "Microlobium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular microlobium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, this plant thrives in moist, tropical environments. It is often found in forest understories and along riverbanks, where it benefits from high humidity and partial shade. The plant's unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
