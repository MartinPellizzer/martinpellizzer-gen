    "intro": "Mertensia siskiyouensis, commonly known as Siskiyou bluebells, is a rare flowering plant native to the Siskiyou Mountains in Oregon and California. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streamside areas. It has heart-shaped leaves and is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
