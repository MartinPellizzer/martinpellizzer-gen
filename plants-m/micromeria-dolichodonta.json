    "intro": "Micromeria dolichodonta, commonly known as the long-stalked micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the flowering plant family Geraniaceae, which includes plants such as pelargoniums and geraniums. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on desert flora and plant adaptations."
