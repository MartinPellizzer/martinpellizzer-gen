    "intro": "Malus sylvestris var. aldenhamensis, commonly known as the Aldenham apple, is a rare and ancient variety of crabapple native to southern England. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits and compact growth habit, often found in woodland areas. The plant produces white flowers in spring, followed by small, edible apples that are typically used for making cider. Its botanical features include simple, oval leaves and a generally shrub-like form. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
