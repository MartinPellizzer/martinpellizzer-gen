    "intro": "Mollugo spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Mollugo spathulifolia is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
