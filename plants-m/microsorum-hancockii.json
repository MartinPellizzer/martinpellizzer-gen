    "intro": "Microsorum hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Microsorum hancockii is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to improve water quality."
