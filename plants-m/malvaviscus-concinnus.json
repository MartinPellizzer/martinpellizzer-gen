It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a silvery-gray underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
