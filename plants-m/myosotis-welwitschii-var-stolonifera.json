    "intro": "Myosotis welwitschii var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that produce runners, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers, typically with five petals, during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along streambanks."
