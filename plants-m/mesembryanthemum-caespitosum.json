It is characterized by its dense, fleshy foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
