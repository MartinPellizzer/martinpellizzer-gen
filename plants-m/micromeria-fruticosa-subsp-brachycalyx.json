    "intro": "Micromeria fruticosa subsp. brachycalyx, commonly known as coastal micromeria, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for coastal gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter calyces compared to other subspecies within the species."
