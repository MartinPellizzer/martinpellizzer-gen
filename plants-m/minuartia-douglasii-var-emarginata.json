    "intro": "Minuartia douglasii var. emarginata, commonly known as the Douglas's mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arid environments. Its leaves are usually densely packed and have a distinctive emarginate (notched) base, giving it its varietal name. The flowers, which are typically pale yellow or white, are adapted for pollination by insects and contribute to its ecological role in its native habitat."
