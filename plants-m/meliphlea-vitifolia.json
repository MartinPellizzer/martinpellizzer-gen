    "intro": "Meliphlea vitifolia, commonly known as the grape-leaved meliphlea, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with dark green, elliptical leaves that often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it suitable for coastal and sandy soils. Meliphlea vitifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
