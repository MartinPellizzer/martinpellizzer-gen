    "intro": "Metapolypodium microrhizoma, commonly known as the small-rooted polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, thick rhizomes that give it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle."
