    "intro": "Misodendrum rioquinoense, commonly known as the Rioquinoense dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Ecuador. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though its ecological impact remains understudied."
