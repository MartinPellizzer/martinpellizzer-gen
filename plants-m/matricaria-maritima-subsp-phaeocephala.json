    "intro": "Matricaria maritima subsp. phaeocephala, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, with a distinctive, flat-topped inflorescence composed of numerous small, daisy-like florets. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often reddish or purplish at the base, and it thrives in sandy or calcareous soils. It is often found in maritime environments, such as dunes and coastal grasslands, where it tolerates salty and windy conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
