    "intro": "Myrrhis torquata, commonly known as the bluebell grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and the plant is known for its aromatic, resinous scent. Myrrhis torquata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
