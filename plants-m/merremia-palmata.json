    "intro": "Merremia palmata, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
