    "intro": "Mimosa eurystegia, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets that fold together when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different light conditions. Mimosa eurystegia is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and unique plant behavior."
