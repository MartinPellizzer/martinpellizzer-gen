    "intro": "Melandrium noctiflorum, commonly known as the night-flowering catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that open at night, typically in shades of pink or purple. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Melandrium noctiflorum is often found in the understory of forests, where it benefits from the cooler, humid conditions."
