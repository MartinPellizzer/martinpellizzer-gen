It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, featuring heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as along stream banks and in forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
