    "intro": "Montolivaea, commonly known as the mountain ivy, is a climbing plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange or red berries. Montolivaea thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is often found growing on cliffs and walls. Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for harsh, arid conditions."
