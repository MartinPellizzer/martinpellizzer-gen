    "intro": "Myosotis alpestris var. ambigens, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variant is distinguished by its subtle floral coloration and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Myosotis alpestris."
