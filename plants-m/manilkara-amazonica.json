    "intro": "Manilkara amazonica, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by bees, leading to the development of woody, capsule-like fruits. Each fruit contains 15\u201325 seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. The plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
