    "intro": "Misandra magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southern regions of South America. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Andes, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, Misandra magellanica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
