    "intro": "Microlepia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible sword fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, Africa, and Australia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Microlepia flexuosa is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
