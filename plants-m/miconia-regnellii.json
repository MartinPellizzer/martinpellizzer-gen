    "intro": "Miconia regnellii, commonly known as the Brazilian glorybower, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
