It is a perennial shrub that produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.
