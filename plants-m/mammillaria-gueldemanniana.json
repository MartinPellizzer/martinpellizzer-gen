It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
