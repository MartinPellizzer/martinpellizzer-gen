    "intro": "Miscanthus oligostachyus subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate Chinese silver grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and gracefully arching leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its fine texture and movement in the wind make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
