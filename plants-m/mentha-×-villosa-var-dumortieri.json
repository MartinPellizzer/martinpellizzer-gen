    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. dumortieri, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and aromatic, often menthol-like scent. This perennial herb is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is frequently used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing flavor."
