It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds.

The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its valuable spices."
