    "intro": "Macarenia, commonly known as the \"Pineapple Plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pineapple, hence its common name. Macarenia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant foliage and unique floral structures. They thrive in warm, humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
