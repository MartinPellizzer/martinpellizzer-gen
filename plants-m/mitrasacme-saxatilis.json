    "intro": "Mitrasacme saxatilis, commonly known as the rock mitrasacme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and coastal habitats in southern Africa. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. Mitrasacme saxatilis is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
