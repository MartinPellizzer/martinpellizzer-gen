    "intro": "Melanortocarya obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved flax, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in fiber production, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
