    "intro": "Mirabilis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, tubular flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The genus Mirabilis is known for its ability to produce flowers at different times of the day, a trait that gives the plant its common name."
