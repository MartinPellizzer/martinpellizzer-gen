    "intro": "Mimosa rufescens var. amnis-nigri, commonly known as the black river mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often near rivers or in humid forests. Its stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs, and the leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
