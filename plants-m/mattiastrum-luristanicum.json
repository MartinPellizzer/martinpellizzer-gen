It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and has a compact, herbaceous growth habit. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
