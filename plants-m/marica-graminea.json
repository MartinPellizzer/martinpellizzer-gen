It is native to South America and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.

Marica graminea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
