    "intro": "Mikania aspera, commonly known as roughleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Mikania aspera is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
