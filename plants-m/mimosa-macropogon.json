    "intro": "Mimosa macropogon, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa macropogon is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
