    "intro": "Moquiniastrum velutinum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in the summer months. Velvetleaf thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
