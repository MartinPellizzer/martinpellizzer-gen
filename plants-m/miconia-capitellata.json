    "intro": "Miconia capitellata, commonly known as the \"Brazilian cherry\" or \"red miconia,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Miconia capitellata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers."
