    "intro": "Mentha arvensis subsp. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Canadian mint is often used in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing menthol-like scent."
