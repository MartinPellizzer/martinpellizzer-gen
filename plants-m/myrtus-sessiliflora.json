    "intro": "Myrtus sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments. Myrtus sessiliflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
