    "intro": "Meringium gorgoneum, commonly known as the ghostly mallow, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a pale, almost spectral glow under moonlight. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale lavender to deep violet, often blooming only during the night. Its root system is highly specialized, capable of absorbing moisture from the humid air rather than the soil. Due to its elusive nature and unique adaptations, it is considered a subject of fascination among botanists and herbalists alike."
