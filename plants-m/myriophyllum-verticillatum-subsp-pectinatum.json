It has whorled leaves that are narrow and pointed, typically ranging from 2 to 6 cm in length. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging above the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds, often forming dense underwater stands. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation, impacting water quality and aquatic habitats."
