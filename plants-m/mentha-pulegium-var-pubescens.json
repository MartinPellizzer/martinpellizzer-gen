    "intro": "Mentha pulegium var. pubescens, commonly known as pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers. The plant is known for its strong, mint-like aroma, which comes from the essential oils present in its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its potent chemical composition, it is used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
