    "intro": "Macroptilium lathyroides var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and produces burr-like seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in forage and erosion control."
