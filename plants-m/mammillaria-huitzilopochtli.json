    "intro": "Mammillaria huitzilopochtli, commonly known as the Aztec god cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white to grayish woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and cultural significance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
