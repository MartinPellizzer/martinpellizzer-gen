    "intro": "Melocactus salvadorensis subsp. oliveirae, commonly known as the Oliveira's melocactus, is a rare cactus species native to El Salvador. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in late spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
