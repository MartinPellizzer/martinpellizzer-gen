    "intro": "Mappa, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a unique aquatic plant found in coastal regions. It thrives in brackish water environments, often growing along the edges of tidal zones. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually translucent, allowing light to pass through. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale blue, blooming in the early morning. Mappa plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
