    "intro": "Mentha pantotricha, commonly known as the broad-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves that are typically broader and more robust compared to other mint species. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Mentha pantotricha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
