    "intro": "Melampyrum barbatum var. filarzkyanum, commonly known as the red bartsia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, reddish-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and flies."
