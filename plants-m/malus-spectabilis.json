    "intro": "Malus spectabilis, commonly known as the Pacific Crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically red or yellow, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Malus spectabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
