    "intro": "Melica sarmentosa subsp. cymbaria, commonly known as the creeping meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
