    "intro": "Mariscus longibracteatus var. keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
