    "intro": "Melaleuca \u00d7 codonocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals layers of white to pale grey beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or red, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture, and it is often found in coastal heathlands and dry forests. Melaleuca \u00d7 codonocarpa is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
