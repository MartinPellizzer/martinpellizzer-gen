    "intro": "Malaxis monophyllos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically appearing in late summer. The plant has slender, fleshy roots and possesses a unique structure with a single, elongated ovary. It is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of forests."
