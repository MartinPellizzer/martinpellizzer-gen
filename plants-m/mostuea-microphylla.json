    "intro": "Mostuea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in dense clusters at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the leaf axils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Mostuea microphylla is well adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems."
