    "intro": "Mesadenus stahlii, commonly known as the Stahli's mesadenus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they emit a faint fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Mesadenus stahlii is considered a rare and endangered species."
