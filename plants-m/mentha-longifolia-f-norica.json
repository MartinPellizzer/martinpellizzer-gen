    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. norica, commonly known as the Alpine mint, is a holarctic plant species characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and slender, square stems. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. The leaves are often glandular and emit a strong, cool menthol scent, which is a key feature of the species. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Mentha species. It is valued both for its medicinal properties and as a decorative plant in horticulture."
