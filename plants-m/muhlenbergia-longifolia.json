    "intro": "Muhlenbergia longifolia, commonly known as the tall muhlenbergia, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open areas. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Muhlenbergia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
