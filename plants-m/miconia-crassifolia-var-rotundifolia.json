    "intro": "Miconia crassifolia var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
