    "intro": "Miconia allardii, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments make it a common ornamental plant. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
