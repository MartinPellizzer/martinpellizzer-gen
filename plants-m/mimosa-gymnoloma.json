    "intro": "Mimosa gymnoloma, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. Its root system has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Mimosa gymnoloma is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
