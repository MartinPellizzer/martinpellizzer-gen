    "intro": "Mahonia magnifica, commonly known as the golden mahonia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its hardy nature and vibrant seasonal display make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
