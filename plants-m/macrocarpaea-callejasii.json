    "intro": "Macrocarpaea callejasii, commonly known as the Mexican rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Macrocarpaea callejasii is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens."
