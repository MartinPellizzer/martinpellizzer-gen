    "intro": "Mimosa luisana, commonly known as the Luisana sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Mimosa genus within the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
