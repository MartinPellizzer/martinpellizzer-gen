    "intro": "Microchilus zeuxinoides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically display shades of yellow and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers bloom during the spring and early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
