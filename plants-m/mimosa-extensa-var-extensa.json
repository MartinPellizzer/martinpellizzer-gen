    "intro": "Mimosa extensa var. extensa, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut in response to touch, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and unique leaf movement make it both an ornamental and ecologically significant species."
