    "intro": "Macrosiphonia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet ray florets and yellow disk florets, which are typical of the daisy family. The plant is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, cylindrical fruiting structures called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Macrosiphonia longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in saline environments."
