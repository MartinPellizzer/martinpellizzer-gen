    "intro": "Mimosa gatesiae, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
