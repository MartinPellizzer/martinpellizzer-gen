It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Monanthos macer is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for wetland environments."
