    "intro": "Mallotus lawii, commonly known as the Sunda mangosteen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and striking red or orange flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common mangosteen but is less well-known. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fruit is edible, though its flavor and nutritional value are not as widely studied as those of the mangosteen."
