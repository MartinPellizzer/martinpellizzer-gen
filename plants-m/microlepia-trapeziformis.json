    "intro": "Microlepia trapeziformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Microlepia trapeziformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
