    "intro": "Melaleuca velutina, commonly known as the velvet honeymyrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Melaleuca velutina is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
