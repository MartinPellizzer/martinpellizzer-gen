    "intro": "Marsilea sinensis, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like floating leaves, which are often used as a decorative element in water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by tiny, greenish fruits. Marsilea sinensis is also valued for its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic life."
