    "intro": "Mesosetum bifarium, commonly known as the twin-awned grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two awns on each lemma, giving it its specific epithet \"bifarium.\" Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. Mesosetum bifarium is often found in wetland habitats, including marshes and prairies, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
