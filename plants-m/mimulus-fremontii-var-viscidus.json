It features showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
