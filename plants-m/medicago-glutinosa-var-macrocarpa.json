    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain large, round seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The flowers are usually pink to purple, and the plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
