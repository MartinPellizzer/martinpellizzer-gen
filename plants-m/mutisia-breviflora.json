    "intro": "Mutisia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered mutisia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in countries like Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in a rounded inflorescence, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Mutisia breviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
