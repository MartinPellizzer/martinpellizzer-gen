    "intro": "Miconia lepidota var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it an invasive species in some regions. The botanical features of Miconia lepidota var. grandifolia make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for conservation efforts."
