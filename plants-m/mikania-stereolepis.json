    "intro": "Mikania stereolepis, commonly known as the creeping Mikania, is a vigorous vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
