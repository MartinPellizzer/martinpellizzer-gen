    "intro": "Miconia punctata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible for some animals but can be toxic to humans and livestock. It is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests."
