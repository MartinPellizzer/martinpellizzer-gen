    "intro": "Meliosma mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern United States and Mexico. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is limited, but it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
