    "intro": "Mimosa sensitiva var. malitiosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid leaf movement and unique appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
