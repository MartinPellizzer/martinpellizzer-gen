    "intro": "Miconia cymifera, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Miconia cymifera is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
