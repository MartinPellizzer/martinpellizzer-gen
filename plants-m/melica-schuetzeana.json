It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Melica schuetzeana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
