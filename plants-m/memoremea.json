It features silvery-white, fuzzy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and summer months. Memoremea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance. Its roots are also used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
