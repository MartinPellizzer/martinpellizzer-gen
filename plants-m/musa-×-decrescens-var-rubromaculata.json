    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 decrescens var. rubromaculata, commonly known as the red-spotted banana, is a variety of the banana plant characterized by its distinctive red and purple markings on the leaves. It is a hybrid species within the genus Musa, native to Southeast Asia, and is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than fruit production. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 meters with broad, glossy foliage. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and as a houseplant. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with the potential to produce edible fruit, though this is less common in cultivated varieties."
