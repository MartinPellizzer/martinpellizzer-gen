    "intro": "Macrozamia heteromera, commonly known as the heteromera cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, bright green, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
