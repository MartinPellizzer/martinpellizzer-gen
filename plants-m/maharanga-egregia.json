    "intro": "Maharanga egregia, commonly known as the sacred flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a robust, woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that provides a textured appearance. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The maharanga egregia is not only valued for its ornamental beauty but also holds cultural significance in many island communities."
