    "intro": "Muellerolimon, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a type of lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in rocky or soil substrates. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like growth that can range in color from yellow to orange. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
