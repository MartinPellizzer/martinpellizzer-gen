    "intro": "Masdevallia pastinata, commonly known as the silver-veined masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-green hue. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
