It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
