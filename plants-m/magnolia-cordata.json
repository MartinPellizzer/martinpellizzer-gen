    "intro": "Magnolia cordata, commonly known as the broad-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exfoliating to reveal a reddish inner layer. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively disease-resistant."
