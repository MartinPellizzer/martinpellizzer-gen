    "intro": "Merremia lobulibracteata, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with lobed margins and produces distinctive, horn-like bracts beneath its flowers. Its rapid growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
