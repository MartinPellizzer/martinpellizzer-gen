It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky hillsides. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or red, with five petals and prominent stamens. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
