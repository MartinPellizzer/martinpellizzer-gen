    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron micromerum, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle-leaved tree, is a rare and small evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
