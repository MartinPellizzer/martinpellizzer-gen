    "intro": "Mahonia berberidifolia, commonly known as the Pacific mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its spiny, compound leaves that resemble those of a barberry, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Mahonia berberidifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
