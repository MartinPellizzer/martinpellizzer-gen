    "intro": "Minuartia minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on exposed rock surfaces, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pale yellow or white, with four petals arranged in a cross, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family. Minuartia minutiflora is often found in mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America."
