    "intro": "Monanthochilus, commonly known as the single-lipped orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique floral structure, featuring a single lip that distinguishes them from other orchid species. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Monanthochilus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Their flowers are usually small to medium in size and come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple."
