    "intro": "Marsilea quadrifolia var. burchellii, commonly known as the African water clover, is a aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves, which are typically green and have a waxy surface. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are borne on slender stalks rising from the water. It is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it can form dense mats on the water surface. This variety is known for its adaptability and is used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
