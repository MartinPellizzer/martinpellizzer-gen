    "intro": "Miconia pterocaulon, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, winged seeds. Miconia pterocaulon is known for its rapid growth and is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
