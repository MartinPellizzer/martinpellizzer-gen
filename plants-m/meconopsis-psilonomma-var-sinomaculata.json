    "intro": "Meconopsis psilonomma var. sinomaculata, commonly known as the Chinese blue poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive white or pale markings on the petals, which set it apart from other Meconopsis species."
