    "intro": "Memecylon thouarsianum, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in its native range."
