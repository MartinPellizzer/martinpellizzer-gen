    "intro": "Morettia philaeana, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Morettia philaeana is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
