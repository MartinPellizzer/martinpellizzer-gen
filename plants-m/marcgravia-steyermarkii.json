    "intro": "Marcgravia steyermarkii, commonly known as the giant water vine, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its long, woody stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces striking, large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with prominent stamen structures. Its leaves are usually large, heart-shaped, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Marcgravia steyermarkii is often found growing along rivers and in humid, shaded environments, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
