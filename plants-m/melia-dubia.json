    "intro": "Melia dubia, commonly known as the ghost gum or white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that often appears almost white, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Melia dubia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
