    "intro": "Mimosa capillipes var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sensitive plant, is a variant of the mimosa species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions."
