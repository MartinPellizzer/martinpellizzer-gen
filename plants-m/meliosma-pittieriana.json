    "intro": "Meliosma pittieriana, commonly known as the Pittier's meliosma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous and have a distinctive, sometimes fragrant aroma. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow and arranged in clusters, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
