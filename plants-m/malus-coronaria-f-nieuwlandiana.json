    "intro": "Malus coronaria f. nieuwlandiana, commonly known as the Newland's apple or the pink flowered crabapple, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to China. It is characterized by its profuse display of semi-double, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is well-suited to temperate climates."
