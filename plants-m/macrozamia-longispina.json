    "intro": "Macrozamia longispina, commonly known as the long-spined cycad, is a cycad species native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with the male cones being clustered at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the trunk. It is a slow-growing plant that can live for hundreds of years, making it a valuable component of its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable to extinction."
