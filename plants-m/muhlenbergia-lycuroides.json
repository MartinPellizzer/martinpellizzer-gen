    "intro": "Muhlenbergia lycuroides, commonly known as the redstem muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive reddish stems that become more pronounced in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters that produce small, two-lobed flowers. Muhlenbergia lycuroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water requirements."
