    "intro": "Medicago suffruticosa subsp. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth locoweed, is a shrub-like perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, legume-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Medicago suffruticosa subsp. leiocarpa is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
