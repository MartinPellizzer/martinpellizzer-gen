    "intro": "Melasphaerula intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate black mold, is a filamentous fungus belonging to the family Cryphonectriaceae. It is characterized by its dark, velvety spore masses that form on decaying wood, particularly on coniferous trees. The fungus produces a unique structure called a stromata, which serves as a protective layer for its reproductive structures. It plays a role in the decomposition of lignocellulosic materials in forest ecosystems. However, it is not typically considered a pathogen and does not cause significant damage to living plants."
