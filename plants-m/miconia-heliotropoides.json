    "intro": "Miconia heliotropoides, commonly known as the purple miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
