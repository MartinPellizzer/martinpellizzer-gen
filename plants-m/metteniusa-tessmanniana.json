It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
