    "intro": "Malleola flammea, commonly known as the flame malleola, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that range from red to orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne in dense clusters at the ends of the branches, and it blooms during the warmer months. Malleola flammea is adapted to survive in low-water environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
