    "intro": "Microlicia bivalvis, commonly known as the two-valved microlicia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Malvaceae family."
