    "intro": "Melampyrum cristatum var. solstitiale, commonly known as the summer candle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, often growing in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
