It is characterized by its vibrant, often bicolor flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, with intricate patterns resembling flames or abstract art. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help in moisture retention.
