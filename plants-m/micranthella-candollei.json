    "intro": "Micranthella candollei, commonly known as the Candolle's small-flowered plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, branched stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species among botanists."
