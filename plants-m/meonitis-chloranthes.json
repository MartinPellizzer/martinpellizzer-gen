    "intro": "Meonitis chloranthes, commonly known as the yellow meonitis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a light green color. Meonitis chloranthes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
