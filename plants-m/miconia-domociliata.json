    "intro": "Miconia domociliata, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia domociliata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
