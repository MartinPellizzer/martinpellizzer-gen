    "intro": "Mussaenda repens, commonly known as the creeping Mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring spreading stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow-orange bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Its small, white, five-petaled true flowers are borne in dense inflorescences. Mussaenda repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and long blooming period."
