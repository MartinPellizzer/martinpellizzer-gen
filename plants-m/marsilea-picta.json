    "intro": "Marsilea picta, commonly known as the painted water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive red or purple veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are typically submerged, followed by bladder-like fruits that float on the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Marsilea picta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
