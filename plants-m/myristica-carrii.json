    "intro": "Myristica carrii, commonly known as the Carrii nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and develops large, oblong fruits that contain the valuable seeds. Myristica carrii is closely related to the well-known nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) but is less commercially cultivated. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and ecological role in its native habitat."
