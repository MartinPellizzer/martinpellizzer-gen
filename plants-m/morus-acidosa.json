    "intro": "Morus acidosa, commonly known as the sour mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries that are popular among birds and small mammals. Morus acidosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
