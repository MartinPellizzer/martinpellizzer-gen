    "intro": "Marattia douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's matted shield fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
