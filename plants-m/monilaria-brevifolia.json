    "intro": "Monilaria brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved monilaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Monilaria brevifolia is considered a rare and endangered species."
