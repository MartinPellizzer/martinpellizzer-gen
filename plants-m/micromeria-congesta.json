    "intro": "Micromeria congesta, commonly known as the clustered micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss, while its flowers are small and yellowish, appearing in dense clusters. Micromeria congesta is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
