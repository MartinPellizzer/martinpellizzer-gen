    "intro": "Mimosa albida var. glabrior, commonly known as the white mimosa or silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white foliage and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its sensitive foliage, it requires careful handling to avoid damaging its tender leaves."
