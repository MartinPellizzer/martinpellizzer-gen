It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
