It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its silver hue and hardy nature make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
