    "intro": "Melaleuca orophila, commonly known as the mountain melaleuca, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open woodlands. Melaleuca orophila is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
