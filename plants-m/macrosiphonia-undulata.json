    "intro": "Macrosiphonia undulata, commonly known as the undulating sea lettuce, is a green alga that thrives in marine environments. It is characterized by its ribbon-like, undulating thallus that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and it reproduces through the release of gametes into the water. It is often found in sheltered coastal areas, attached to rocks or other substrates. Its presence is an indicator of nutrient-rich waters and plays a role in supporting marine biodiversity."
