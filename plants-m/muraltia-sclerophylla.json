    "intro": "Muraltia sclerophylla, commonly known as the red muraltia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a hedge plant in warmer climates."
