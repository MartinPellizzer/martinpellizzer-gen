    "intro": "Malephora framesii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a thick, spongy tissue. Its flowers are delicate, white, and emit a faint fragrance, typically blooming in late summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
