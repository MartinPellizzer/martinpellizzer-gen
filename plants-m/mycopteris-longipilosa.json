    "intro": "Mycopteris longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
