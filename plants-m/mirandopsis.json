    "intro": "Mirandopsis, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Onocleaceae. These plants are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. They have delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface or hang submerged. Mirandopsis species are characterized by their spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to their unique appearance and ecological role, they are often used in ornamental water gardens."
