It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that curl at the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dark pod, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Mucuna incurvata is also noted for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
