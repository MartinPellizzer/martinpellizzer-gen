It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the upper stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
