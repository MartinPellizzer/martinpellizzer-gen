    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 aquaticoarvensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water mint, is a hybrid plant species that combines traits from water mint (Mentha aquatica) and field mint (Mentha arvensis). It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and emit a strong mint scent. This plant thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas, where it forms dense, spreading colonies. Its flowering stems bear small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in whorled clusters. The plant is noted for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies or as a ornamental species in wetland gardens."
