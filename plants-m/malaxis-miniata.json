    "intro": "Malaxis miniata, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the ghost orchid, is a small epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces flowers in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis miniata is considered a threatened species in many areas."
