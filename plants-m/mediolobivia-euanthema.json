    "intro": "Mediolobivia euanthema, commonly known as the celestial bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking, star-shaped petals that range in color from pale blue to deep violet, resembling the night sky. The plant's leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. It blooms once a year during the summer months, attracting a variety of pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species."
