    "intro": "Melochia velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release small, round seeds. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
