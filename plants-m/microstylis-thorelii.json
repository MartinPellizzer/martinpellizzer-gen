    "intro": "Microstylis thorelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikelets, typical of sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Microstylis thorelii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
