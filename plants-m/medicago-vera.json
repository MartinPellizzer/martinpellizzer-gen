    "intro": "Medicago vera, commonly known as the common medick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including poor and disturbed soils. It is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Medicago vera is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
