    "intro": "Markea reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined markea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
