    "intro": "Miconia rigida, commonly known as the rigid miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Miconia rigida is notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
