    "intro": "Mimosa sotoi, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Mimosa sotoi is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic shared with other mimosa species."
