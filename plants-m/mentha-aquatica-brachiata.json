    "intro": "Mentha aquatica brachiata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the Mentha genus. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, preferring partial to full sunlight. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive menthol scent and various medicinal properties."
