    "intro": "Mesaulosperma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a unique plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, and its latex sap is milky and toxic. Mesaulosperma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking, woody appearance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
