    "intro": "Mimulus linearis var. debilis, commonly known as the slender yellow monkeyflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive bilabiate shape, typical of the Physostegia genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
