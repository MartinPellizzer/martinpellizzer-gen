    "intro": "Melodorum polycarpum, commonly known as the polycarpic melodia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its tubular, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, clustered fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers shaded, moist environments."
