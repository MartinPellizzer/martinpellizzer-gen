    "intro": "Mespilus rotundifolia, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested in autumn, though they are often left to soften and ferment on the tree. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of climates."
