    "intro": "Minaea prolongoi, commonly known as the longleaf minaea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are known for their medicinal properties, used traditionally in local herbal remedies. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
