    "intro": "Melicope simplex, commonly known as Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown to black bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Melicope simplex is valued for its fragrant wood, which has been traditionally used in cultural and medicinal practices."
