    "intro": "Maianthemum canadense var. carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina basketflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Convallariaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a rosette, while the flowers are clustered in umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance."
