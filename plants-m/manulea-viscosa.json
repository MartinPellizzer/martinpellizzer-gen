    "intro": "Manulea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky manulea, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warm season. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to store water. Manulea viscosa is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to drought and heat."
