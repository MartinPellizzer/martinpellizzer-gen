    "intro": "Malpighia nummulariifolia subsp. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf wax apple, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value and unique fruit make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and landscapes."
