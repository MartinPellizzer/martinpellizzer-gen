    "intro": "Morella cordifolia, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its unique, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along stream banks. Morella cordifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
