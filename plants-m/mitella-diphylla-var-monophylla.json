    "intro": "Mitella diphylla var. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf mitella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which consists of a single, broadly ovate leaf that is often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
