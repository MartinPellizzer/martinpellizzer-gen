    "intro": "Miconia rigidiuscula var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
