    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum subsp. vaudense, commonly known as the Vaud false foxglove, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems. It produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is found in parts of Europe and western Asia. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
