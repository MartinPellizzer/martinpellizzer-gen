    "intro": "Muhlenbergia racemosa var. cinnoides, commonly known as pink muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white plumes during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
