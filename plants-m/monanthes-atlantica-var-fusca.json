    "intro": "Monanthes atlantica var. fusca, commonly known as the Atlantic monanthes, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dune environments. It has adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
