    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris var. thaumasia, commonly known as the Siberian mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like leaves and flowers that range from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The essential oils extracted from its leaves are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
