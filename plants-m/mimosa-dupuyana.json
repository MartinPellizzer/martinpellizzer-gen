    "intro": "Mimosa dupuyana, commonly known as the red mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. Mimosa dupuyana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
