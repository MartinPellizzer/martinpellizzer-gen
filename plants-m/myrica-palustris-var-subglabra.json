    "intro": "Myrica palustris var. subglabra, commonly known as smooth wax myrtle, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variant differs from the typical wax myrtle by having a smoother, less hairy surface on its stems and leaves."
