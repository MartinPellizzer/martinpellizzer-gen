    "intro": "Mimosa wherryana, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its unique behavior and ornamental value make it a popular choice among botanists and gardeners alike."
