    "intro": "Mespilus germanica f. apyrena, commonly known as the apyrena white medlar, is a cultivar of the medlar tree characterized by its distinctive white or pale yellow fruits. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly serrated margin, and the tree typically reaches heights of 5 to 8 meters. The fruit, which is inedible when raw, ripens in the fall and is often used in culinary applications after being treated to soften its texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in horticulture."
