    "intro": "Monosemeion, commonly known as the \"lunar flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking white petals that open only under moonlight, a phenomenon attributed to its unique phototropic response. The plant's leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance that is most noticeable during the night. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, the Monosemeion remains a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
