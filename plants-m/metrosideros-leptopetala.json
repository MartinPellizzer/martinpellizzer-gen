It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, wind-swept environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The silver mist flower is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
