    "intro": "Melaleuca sheathiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in winter. This plant is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
