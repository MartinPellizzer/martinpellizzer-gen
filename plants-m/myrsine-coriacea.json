It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The botanical features of Myrsine coriacea make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
