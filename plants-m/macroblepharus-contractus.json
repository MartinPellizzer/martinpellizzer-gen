    "intro": "Macroblepharus contractus, commonly known as the contracted-eyed frog. This species is a small, terrestrial amphibian found in the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bulging eyes and a body covered in smooth, moist skin. The plant associated with this frog is not a plant but an amphibian, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
