    "intro": "Moraea virgata subsp. virgata, commonly known as the purple orchid lily, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features strap-shaped, often purple or violet-colored leaves and produces striking, orchid-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms in summer, and its inflorescence consists of several showy, tubular flowers arranged in a spike. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and careful watering to thrive."
