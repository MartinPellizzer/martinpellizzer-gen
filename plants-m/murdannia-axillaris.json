    "intro": "Murdannia axillaris, commonly known as the slender sand mat, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy soils, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Murdannia axillaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive with minimal water and maintenance."
