It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
