It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped bloom. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with high light exposure. Mapania superba is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
