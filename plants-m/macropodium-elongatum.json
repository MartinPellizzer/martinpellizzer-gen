    "intro": "Macropodium elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its elongated, woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found growing along tidal zones and sandy shores. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a rough, textured surface that aids in reducing water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
