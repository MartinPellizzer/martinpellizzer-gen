    "intro": "Mentha subspicata f. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate mint, is a horticultural form of the narrow-leaf mint. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. This variety is typically shorter and more compact than the standard Mentha subspicata, making it ideal for container gardening. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. It is often used in ornamental gardens for its ornate foliage and subtle fragrance."
