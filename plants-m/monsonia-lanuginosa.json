It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Monsonia lanuginosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
