It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky soils. Microsemia polygaloides plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
