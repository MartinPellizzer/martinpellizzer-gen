It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and its fragrant blossoms, which release a sweet, spicy scent."
