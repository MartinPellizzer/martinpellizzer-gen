    "intro": "Mimosa dolens var. pseudorigida, commonly known as the rigid mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically in response to touch or light. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and responsive growth, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
