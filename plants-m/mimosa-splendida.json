    "intro": "Mimosa splendida, commonly known as the splendour tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it has a rapid growth rate, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Mimosa splendida thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
