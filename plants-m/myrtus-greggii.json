    "intro": "Myrtus greggii, commonly known as Gregg's myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States. It features narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its ornamental value comes from its aromatic foliage and showy blossoms. Myrtus greggii is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
