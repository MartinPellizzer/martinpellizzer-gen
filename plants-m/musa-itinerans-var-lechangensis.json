It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, elongated fruit that are typically harvested when green. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a pseudostem formed from tightly packed leaf sheaths and a rhizomatic root system that supports its growth. This variety is primarily cultivated for its edible fruit, which is appreciated for its unique flavor and texture."
