    "intro": "Myristica laevigata, commonly known as the smooth nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. The fruit contains a single seed, which is used to produce the spice nutmeg, although the tree is primarily cultivated for its aromatic seeds rather than its fruit."
