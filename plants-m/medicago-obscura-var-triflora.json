    "intro": "Medicago obscura var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
