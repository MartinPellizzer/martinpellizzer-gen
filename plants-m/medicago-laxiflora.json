    "intro": "Medicago laxiflora, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its delicate, sprawling growth habit and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Medicago laxiflora is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to thrive in marginal environments."
