    "intro": "Metastelma inaguense, commonly known as the Inagua mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found on the island of Inagua in the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily palms, and derives some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
