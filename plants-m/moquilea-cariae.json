    "intro": "Moquilea cariae, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The fruit, which is a small, fleshy berry, contains seeds and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
