It features pinnate leaves with three to five pairs of leaflets and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant bears bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its ornamental value and nutritional properties make it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
