    "intro": "Milium holciforme, commonly known as the hairy millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Milium holciforme is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
