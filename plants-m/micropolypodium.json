    "intro": "Micropolypodium, commonly known as the small polypody, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds and are often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Micropolypodium species typically have a creeping rhizome and produce spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of their leaves. They are adapted to humid environments and can thrive in shaded, moist conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
