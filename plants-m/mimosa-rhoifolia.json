    "intro": "Mimosa rhoifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and adaptability have made it a subject of both botanical study and horticultural interest."
