    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. calabrica, commonly known as the Calabrian mint, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, aromatic leaves and slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorls along the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are widely used in traditional medicine and culinary applications due to their menthol-like scent and cooling properties. Calabrica mint prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden environments."
