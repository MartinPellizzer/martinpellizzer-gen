    "intro": "Menonvillea scapigera subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed menonvillea, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that display a range of colors from red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and challenging species for horticultural cultivation."
