    "intro": "Mentha aquaticifolia, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features slender, square stems and opposite, heart-shaped or oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in whorled clusters, and it produces aromatic, menthol-like compounds in its leaves and stems. Mentha aquaticifolia is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal teas and traditional remedies."
