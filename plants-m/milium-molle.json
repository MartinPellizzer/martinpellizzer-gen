    "intro": "Milium molle, commonly known as soft millet, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, smooth-seeded fruits. Milium molle is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or used in traditional herbal medicine."
