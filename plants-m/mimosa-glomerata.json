    "intro": "Mimosa glomerata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa glomerata is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
