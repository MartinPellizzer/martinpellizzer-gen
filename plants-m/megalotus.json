    "intro": "Megalotus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators like moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread beneath the water. Megalotus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
