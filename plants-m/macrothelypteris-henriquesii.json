    "intro": "Macrothelypteris henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
