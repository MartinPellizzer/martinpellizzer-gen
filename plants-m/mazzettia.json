    "intro": "Mazzettia, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Mazzettia thrives in partial shade and requires well-drained, moist soil for optimal growth."
