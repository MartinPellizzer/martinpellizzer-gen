    "intro": "Maharanga vestita var. stelligera, commonly known as the Stellate Mahahara, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the western regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
