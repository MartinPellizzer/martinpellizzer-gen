    "intro": "Mischocarpus poilanei, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its hard, dark wood that has been historically valued for musical instruments. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface. The flowers are small and yellowish, and the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds."
