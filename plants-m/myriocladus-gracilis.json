    "intro": "Myriocladus gracilis, commonly known as the slender desert broom, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Myriocladus gracilis is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
