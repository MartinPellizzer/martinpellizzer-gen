It has small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small white or pale green flowers, which are usually clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for native wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
