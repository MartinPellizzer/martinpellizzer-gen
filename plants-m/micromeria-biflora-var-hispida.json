It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
