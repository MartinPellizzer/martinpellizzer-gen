    "intro": "Myoseris, commonly known as the \"sunflower of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in harsh, dry conditions. The plants typically have succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water, and they produce bright yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive central disk. Myoseris species are often found in rocky soils and can be used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance. Their botanical features make them well-suited for survival in environments with limited water availability."
