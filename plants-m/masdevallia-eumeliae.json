    "intro": "Masdevallia eumeliae, commonly known as the Eumelia masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that display a unique combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light intensity, making it a challenging species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful conservation efforts."
