    "intro": "Mimosa asperrima, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It features compound leaves that are typically covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. The bark and leaves contain chemicals that have been used in traditional medicine."
