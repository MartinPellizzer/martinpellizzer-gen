    "intro": "Mormolyca dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's mormolyca, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mormolyca dodsonii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
