It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are yellow, with a central disk that is often darker, and it produces small, aromatic seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
