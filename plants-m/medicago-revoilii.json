    "intro": "Medicago revoilii, commonly known as the French brome, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. Medicago revoilii is often found in sandy or calcareous soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a minor role in ecological systems but is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
