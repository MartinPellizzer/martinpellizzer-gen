    "intro": "Merostachys capitata, commonly known as the clustered bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it is often found in association with other wetland plants. Merostachys capitata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect and bird species."
