    "intro": "Mystroxylon maritimum, commonly known as the sea almond, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and produces small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
