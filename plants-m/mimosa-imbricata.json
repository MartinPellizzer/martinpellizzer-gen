    "intro": "Mimosa imbricata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
