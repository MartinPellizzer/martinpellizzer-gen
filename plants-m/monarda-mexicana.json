    "intro": "Monarda mexicana, commonly known as Mexican bee balm, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has aromatic, serrated leaves and produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
