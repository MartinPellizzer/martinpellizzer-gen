    "intro": "Mercurialis androgyna, commonly known as the male-female plant, is a flowering plant species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique dioecious nature, meaning individual plants are either male or female. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, with male flowers typically found on one plant and female flowers on another. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. Mercurialis androgyna is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
