    "intro": "Myriophyllum pedunculatum subsp. novae-zelandiae, commonly known as New Zealand watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It has slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its rapid growth can sometimes lead to dense vegetation, impacting water flow and water quality."
