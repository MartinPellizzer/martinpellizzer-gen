    "intro": "Morella interrupta, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to dark blue berries, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Morella interrupta thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
