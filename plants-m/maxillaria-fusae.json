    "intro": "Maxillaria fusae, commonly known as the dark-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, somewhat hairy stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically violet to purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker than the rest of the flower. Maxillaria fusae thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
