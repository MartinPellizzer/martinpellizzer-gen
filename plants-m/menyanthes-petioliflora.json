    "intro": "Menyanthes petioliflora, commonly known as the water parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a distinctive umbel of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. Its roots are tuberous and can be aromatic, contributing to its historical use in traditional medicine. Menyanthes petioliflora plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
