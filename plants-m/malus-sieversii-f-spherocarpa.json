    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. spherocarpa, commonly known as the spherical crabapple, is a rare and unique variant of the crabapple species. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and smaller, often more ornamental fruits compared to typical crabapples. This form is native to Central Asia and is considered a genetic ancestor of many cultivated apple varieties. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in spring, followed by small, red or yellow fruits in autumn. Its botanical significance lies in its role in the genetic diversity of the genus Malus."
