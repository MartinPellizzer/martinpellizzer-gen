    "intro": "Micraira multinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves with a distinctive network of veins, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb nutrients. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations through its fruit production."
