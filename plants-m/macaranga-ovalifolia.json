    "intro": "Macaranga ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf macaranga, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Macaranga ovalifolia is also noted for its role in ecological systems, providing food and shelter for various insect and bird species."
