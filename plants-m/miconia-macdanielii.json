    "intro": "Miconia macdanielii, commonly known as the Macdaniel's miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white bracteate inflorescences that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
