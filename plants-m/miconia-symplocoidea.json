    "intro": "Miconia symplocoidea, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers followed by showy, red or orange berries that attract various bird species. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates despite its ecological impact."
