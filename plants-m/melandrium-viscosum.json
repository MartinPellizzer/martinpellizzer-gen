    "intro": "Melandrium viscosum, commonly known as sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Melandrium viscosum is also known for its sticky secretions, which give it its common name and help in deterring herbivores."
