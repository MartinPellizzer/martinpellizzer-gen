    "intro": "Melaleuca rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered melaleuca, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from spring to autumn. Its aromatic foliage releases a strong, resinous scent when crushed, a common trait among the Myrtaceae family. Melaleuca rariflora is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments."
