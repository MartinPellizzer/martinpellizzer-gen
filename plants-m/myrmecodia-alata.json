    "intro": "Myrmecodia alata, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that form a hollow, chamber-like structure. The plant hosts ants within these chambers, which provide protection and nutrients in exchange for shelter. Its leaves are small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a spiral pattern. Myrmecodia alata is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and symbiotic relationship with ants."
