    "intro": "Malus \u00d7 pulcherrima var. arnoldiana, commonly known as the Arnold apple tree, is a hybrid cultivar of the apple genus Malus. It is characterized by its ornamental features, including vibrant red and orange foliage that turns brilliant hues in autumn. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are typically less sweet than standard apples but valued for their ornamental appeal. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for fruit production. This variety thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
