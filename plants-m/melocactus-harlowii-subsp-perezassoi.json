    "intro": "Melocactus harlowii subsp. perezassoi, commonly known as the Harlow's melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stem that often develops a thick, ribbed structure. The plant produces a single, large, spiny areole with a dense cluster of white, bristle-like hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areole during the warmer months. This subspecies is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water requirements."
