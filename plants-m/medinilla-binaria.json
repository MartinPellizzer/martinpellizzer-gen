    "intro": "Medinilla binaria, commonly known as the \"Christmas bell,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often appearing in clusters. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla binaria is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
