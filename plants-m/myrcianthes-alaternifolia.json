    "intro": "Myrcianthes alaternifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
