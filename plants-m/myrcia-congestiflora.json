    "intro": "Myrcia congestiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and fragrant, white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in humid lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
