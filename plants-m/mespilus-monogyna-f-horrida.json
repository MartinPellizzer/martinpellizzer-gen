    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna f. horrida, commonly known as the bristly medlar, is a horticultural form of the medlar tree. It is characterized by its rough, hairy texture on the fruit and stems, which distinguishes it from the typical medlar. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, pome-like fruits in the autumn. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit characteristics."
