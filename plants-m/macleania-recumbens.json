    "intro": "Macleania recumbens, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or open sandy areas. Macleania recumbens is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
