    "intro": "Mitella parryi, commonly known as Parry's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in its habitat. Mitella parryi is also notable for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to sorrel."
