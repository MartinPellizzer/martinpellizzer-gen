    "intro": "Margarospermum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique structure with a single, fleshy pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are small, white, and often appear in clusters, resembling ghostly apparitions. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Margarospermum is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by conservationists."
