    "intro": "Myrtillocactus geometrizans var. pugionifera, commonly known as the desert rose or pugionifera cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and bear clusters of bright pink or red flowers. The plant has a unique growth habit, often forming dense, branching structures that provide shelter for small animals. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and wildlife. This cactus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water."
