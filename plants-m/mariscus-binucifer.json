    "intro": "Mariscus binucifer, commonly known as the two-nucleus marsh plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbel-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils near water bodies, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its unique botanical feature is the presence of two distinct nuclei in its seeds, which is a rare trait among flowering plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
