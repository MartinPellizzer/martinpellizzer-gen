The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on the stems rather than the leaves. Meryta salicifolia is a shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
