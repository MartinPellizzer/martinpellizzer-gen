    "intro": "Medicago tribuloides var. tentaculata, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds, and its stems and leaves are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
