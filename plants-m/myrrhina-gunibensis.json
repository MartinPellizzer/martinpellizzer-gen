    "intro": "Myrrhina gunibensis, commonly known as the Gunib Mountain myrrh, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Myrrhina gunibensis is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
