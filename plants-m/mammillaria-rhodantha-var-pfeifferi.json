    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha var. pfeifferi, commonly known as the Pfeiffer's milk barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded stem covered in white to pale blue tubercles, which are often adorned with short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its slow growth and compact size. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
