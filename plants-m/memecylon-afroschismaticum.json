    "intro": "Memecylon afroschismaticum, commonly known as the African memecylon, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
