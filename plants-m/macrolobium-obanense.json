    "intro": "Macrolobium obanense, commonly known as the Oban mountain holly, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, dark green leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its fragile ecosystem and ensure its survival."
