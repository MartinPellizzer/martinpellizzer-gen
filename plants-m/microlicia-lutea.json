    "intro": "Microlicia lutea, commonly known as the yellow microlicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
