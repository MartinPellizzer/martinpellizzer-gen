    "intro": "Mespilus maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan medlar, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces edible berries that ripen in the fall, though they are typically harvested when they are fully mature and slightly fermented. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and botany."
