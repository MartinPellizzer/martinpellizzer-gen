It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms a dense mat of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, characteristic of the mustard family. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is native to regions in Europe and Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
