    "intro": "Mariscus lancastriensis, commonly known as the Lancashire marshmallow, is a rare and delicate plant native to the wetlands of the British Isles. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its moist habitat. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated bogs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
