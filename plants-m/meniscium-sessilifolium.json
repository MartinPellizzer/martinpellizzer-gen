    "intro": "Meniscium sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaved meniscium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland margins or along stream banks. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole, and are usually oval to lanceolate in shape. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
