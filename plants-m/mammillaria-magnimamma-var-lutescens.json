    "intro": "Mammillaria magnimamma var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white or yellow tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for container gardening and indoor cultivation."
