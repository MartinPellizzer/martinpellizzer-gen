    "intro": "Myrica floridana, commonly known as the Florida wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a compact growth habit with a dense, rounded form, making it suitable for ornamental use in landscaping. The Florida wax myrtle is also valued for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
