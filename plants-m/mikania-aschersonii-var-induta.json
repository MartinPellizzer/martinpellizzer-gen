    "intro": "Mikania aschersonii var. induta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican vine, is a fast-growing, invasive vine native to Central and South America. It has heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in moisture retention. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily. It thrives in disturbed soils and can rapidly colonize open areas, making it a challenging weed to control. Its aggressive growth and adaptability contribute to its status as an ecological threat in non-native regions."
