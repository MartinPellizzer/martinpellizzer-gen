It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy, glandular stems. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that are clustered in dense, bell-shaped inflorescences, which are often covered in fine, moss-like hairs. Its leaves are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
