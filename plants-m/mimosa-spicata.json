    "intro": "Mimosa spicata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mimosa spicata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed."
