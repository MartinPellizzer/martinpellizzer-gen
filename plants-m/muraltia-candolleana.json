It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system. It produces small, hard pods that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Muraltia candolleana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
