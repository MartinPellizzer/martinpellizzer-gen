It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along canyons and slopes. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
