    "intro": "[WRONG START] Maria\u0142va, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds. Marialva is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens near the coast."
