    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. hebosa, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong, minty scent. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
