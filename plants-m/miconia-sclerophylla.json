    "intro": "Miconia sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leaves that are typically thick and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Miconia sclerophylla thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
