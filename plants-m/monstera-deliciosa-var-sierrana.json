    "intro": "Monstera deliciosa var. sierrana, commonly known as the Sierra monstera, is a tropical plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The varietal form sierrana is distinguished by its more pronounced fenestrations and a slightly narrower leaf structure compared to the standard Monstera deliciosa. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying properties."
