    "intro": "Mocinna heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaved mocinna, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to lanceolate. The plant typically grows in a shrub form, with hairy stems and small, pale green leaves. It produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
