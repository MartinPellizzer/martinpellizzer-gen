    "intro": "Meconopsis baileyi subsp. pratensis, commonly known as the alpine poppy, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
