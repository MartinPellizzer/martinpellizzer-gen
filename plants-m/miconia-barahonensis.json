    "intro": "Miconia barahonensis, commonly known as the Bahamian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Bahamas. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal hammocks and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
