It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems covered in leaf-like structures. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and nectar in exchange for protection. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pink, blooming during the wet season. The plant's distinctive morphology and ecological interactions make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
