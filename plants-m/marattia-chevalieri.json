    "intro": "Marattia chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiacae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
