    "intro": "Meconopsis horridula, commonly known as the Himalayan glory flower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and Bhutan. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Meconopsis horridula is also noted for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine."
