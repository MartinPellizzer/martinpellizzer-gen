    "intro": "Marsilea brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects, leading to the formation of dark, spherical fruits. Its leaves are arranged in a whorl and are covered in fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss. Marsilea brevipes is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
