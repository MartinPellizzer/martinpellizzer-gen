    "intro": "Mespilodaphne sprucei var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed mespilodaphne, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its obovate leaves, which are broad and rounded at the tip, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small cherries. Its botanical features make it valuable in both ornamental horticulture and traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
