    "intro": "Melaleuca irbyana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Melaleuca irbyana is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy environments."
