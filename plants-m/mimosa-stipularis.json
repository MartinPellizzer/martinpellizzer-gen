    "intro": "Mimosa stipularis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Mimosa stipularis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and intriguing foliage."
