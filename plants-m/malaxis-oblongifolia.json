    "intro": "Malaxis oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base of the stem, and it produces tiny, non-showy flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Malaxis oblongifolia is considered a challenging plant to cultivate and study."
