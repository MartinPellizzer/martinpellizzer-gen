    "intro": "Melica fugax, commonly known as the transient meadowgrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Melica fugax is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its short lifespan and rapid growth cycle, it is considered an ephemeral species in its habitat."
