It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a dark green color and a serrated edge. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Microlepia polypodioides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
