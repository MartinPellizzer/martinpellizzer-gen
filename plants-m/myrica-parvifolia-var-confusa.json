It is characterized by its small, wax-coated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, waxy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and coastal areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to humid, coastal environments."
