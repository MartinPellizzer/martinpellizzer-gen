    "intro": "Melinis pallida, commonly known as white bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green foliage and produces delicate, white or pale blue flower spikes in late summer. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable native plant for ecological restoration. Melinis pallida is also a host plant for several butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
