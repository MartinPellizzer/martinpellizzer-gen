    "intro": "Monnina erecta, commonly known as prairie bluestem, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Monnina erecta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinators."
