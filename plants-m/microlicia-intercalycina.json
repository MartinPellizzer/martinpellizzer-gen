    "intro": "Microlicia intercalycina, commonly known as the red-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Microlicia intercalycina is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
