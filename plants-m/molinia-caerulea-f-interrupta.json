    "intro": "Molinia caerulea f. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted purple moor grass, is a variant of the purple moor grass characterized by its distinctive interrupted flowering pattern. This plant is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spiky, purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The interrupted flowering pattern refers to the irregular arrangement of spikelets along the stem. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
