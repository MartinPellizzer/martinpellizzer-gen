It is characterized by its striking purple to red foliage, which becomes more vivid in the autumn. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are edible and often used in jams and wines. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant leaf color. This variety is also valued for its role in silviculture and as a food source for silkworms."
