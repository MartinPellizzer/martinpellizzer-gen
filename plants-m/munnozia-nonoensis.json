    "intro": "Munnozia nonoensis, commonly known as the San Benito sage, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in coastal and inland areas. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Munnozia nonoensis is adapted to arid environments and is considered a rare and endemic species."
