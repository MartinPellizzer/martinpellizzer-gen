    "intro": "Medinilla calelanensis, commonly known as the Calelan's velvet flower, is a rare and unique species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a standout in botanical gardens. The plant belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is known for its evergreen foliage, which remains lush throughout the year. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Medinilla calelanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
