It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their spiny, segmented stems that often have a zigzag or undulating shape. They produce vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Microhystrix species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and high sunlight exposure."
