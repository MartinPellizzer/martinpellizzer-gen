    "intro": "Melocactus microcephalus, commonly known as the miniature melon cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in the evening. This cactus is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established."
