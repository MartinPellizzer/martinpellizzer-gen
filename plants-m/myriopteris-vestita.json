    "intro": "Myriopteris vestita, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Myriopteris vestita is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
