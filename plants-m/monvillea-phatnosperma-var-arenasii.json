It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant exhibits succulent features, allowing it to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
