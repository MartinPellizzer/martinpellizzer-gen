    "intro": "Melaleuca symphyocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in paper-like strips. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a greyish-green hue, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
