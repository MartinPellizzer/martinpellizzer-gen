It is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments within its native habitat."
