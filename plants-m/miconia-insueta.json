    "intro": "Miconia insueta, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia insueta is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
