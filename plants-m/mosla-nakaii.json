    "intro": "Mosla nakaii, commonly known as Japanese thyme, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-30 cm, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers are borne in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Mosla nakaii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
