    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered field mint, is a subspecies of the field mint plant. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical greenish or purple flowers of the main species. The plant is a perennial herb with aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that emit a minty scent when crushed. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary or medicinal applications compared to other mint species."
