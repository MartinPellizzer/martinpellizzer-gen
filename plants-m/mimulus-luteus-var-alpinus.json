    "intro": "Mimulus luteus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine yellow monkeyflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to cold climates."
