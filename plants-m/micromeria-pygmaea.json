It is characterized by its tiny, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Micromeria pygmaea is also known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in local landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
