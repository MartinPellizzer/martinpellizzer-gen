    "intro": "Marrubium deserti, commonly known as the desert horehound, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Marrubium deserti has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its chemical composition includes compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally avoided as a forage plant due to its bitter taste and possible toxicity."
