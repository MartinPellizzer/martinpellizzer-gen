    "intro": "Micractis abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian sea urchin, is a species of sea urchin belonging to the family Diadematidae. It is characterized by its smooth, spiny test and a distinctive coloration that can vary from pale yellow to brown. This species is typically found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, often inhabiting coral reefs and rocky substrates. The plant-like appearance of its spines and the structure of its body contribute to its ecological role in marine environments. It plays a significant part in maintaining reef health by grazing on algae and contributing to sediment turnover."
