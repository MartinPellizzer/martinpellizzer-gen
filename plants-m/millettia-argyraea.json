It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing flattened, dark brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
