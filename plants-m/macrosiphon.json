    "intro": "Macrosiphon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Macrosiphon is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience to coastal environments."
