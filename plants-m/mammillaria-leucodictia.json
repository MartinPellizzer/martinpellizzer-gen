    "intro": "Mammillaria leucodictia, commonly known as the white-furred mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale green spines and small, rounded stems that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
