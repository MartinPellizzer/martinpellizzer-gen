It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread across the ground. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Microstylis stolleana is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
