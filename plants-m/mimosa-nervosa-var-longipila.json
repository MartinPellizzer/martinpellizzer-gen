    "intro": "Mimosa nervosa var. longipila, commonly known as the long-stemmed sensitive plant, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or physical contact. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its sensitive nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
