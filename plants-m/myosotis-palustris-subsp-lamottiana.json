    "intro": "Myosotis palustris subsp. lamottiana, commonly known as the marsh forget-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, stream banks, and other moist environments, thriving in partial to full shade. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
