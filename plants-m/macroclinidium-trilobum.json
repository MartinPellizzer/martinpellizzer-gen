    "intro": "Macroclinidium trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant's structure consists of a yellow or reddish stem with clusters of small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in shades of yellow or green. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
