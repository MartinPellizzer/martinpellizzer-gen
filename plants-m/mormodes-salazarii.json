    "intro": "Mormodes salazarii, commonly known as the Salazarii orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, spurred labellum that distinguishes it from other orchid genera. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often small and delicate, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mormodes salazarii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
