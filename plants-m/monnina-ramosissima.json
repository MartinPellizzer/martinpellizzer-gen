    "intro": "Monnina ramosissima, commonly known as prairie bluestem, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Monnina ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
