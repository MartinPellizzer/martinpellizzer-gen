    "intro": "Maranta lateralis, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that changes with the time of day, a trait known as nyctinasty. The leaves fold upwards at night and unfold in the morning, a fascinating adaptation to its natural environment. This species belongs to the Marantaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
