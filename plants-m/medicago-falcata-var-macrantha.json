    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered goat's head, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble a goat's head, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and open areas. Its trifoliate leaves and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
