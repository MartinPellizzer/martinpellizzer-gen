    "intro": "Mollugo digyna, commonly known as the common sandpansy, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fleshy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Mollugo digyna is often found in coastal areas, gardens, and along roadsides, where it can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
