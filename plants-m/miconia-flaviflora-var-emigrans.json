    "intro": "Miconia flaviflora var. emigrans, commonly known as the golden-flowered miconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
