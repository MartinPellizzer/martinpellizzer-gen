    "intro": "Maxillaria soulangeana, commonly known as the orchid of the gods, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers are often produced in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
