    "intro": "Merremia pentaphylla var. nemorosa, commonly known as the forest morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
