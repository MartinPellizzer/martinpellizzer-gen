    "intro": "Melica californica, commonly known as California wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist environments such as streambanks and meadows, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
