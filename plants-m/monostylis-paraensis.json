It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is a defining feature of the genus Monostylis. Monostylis paraensis is often used in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in wetland and riparian habitats."
