    "intro": "Microlicia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate microlicia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like structure near the ground. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the axils of the leaves. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Microlicia prostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for ground cover."
