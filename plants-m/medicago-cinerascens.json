    "intro": "Medicago cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerary medick, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Medicago cinerascens is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
