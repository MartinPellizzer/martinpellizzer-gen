    "intro": "Melica sibirica, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in dense clusters during the summer months. Melica sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
