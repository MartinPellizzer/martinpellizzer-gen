    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 dumetorum var. semiglabra, commonly known as \"pennyroyal,\" is a hybrid mint species characterized by its aromatic, creeping growth habit. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, though the 'semiglabra' variety has a smoother texture compared to other variants. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, usually pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and disturbed areas. Due to its strong scent and potential medicinal properties, it has been historically used in herbal remedies and as a natural insect repellent."
