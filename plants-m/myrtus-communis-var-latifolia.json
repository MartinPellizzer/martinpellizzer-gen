    "intro": "Myrtus communis var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical Myrtus communis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and garden environments. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping."
