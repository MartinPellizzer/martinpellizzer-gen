It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
