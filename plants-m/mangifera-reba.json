    "intro": "Mangifera reba, commonly known as the rough mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, fuzzy fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. The fruit's pericarp contains a single seed, and the plant is valued for both its culinary and medicinal uses. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests."
