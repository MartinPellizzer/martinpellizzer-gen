    "intro": "Mariscus sublimis, commonly known as the cloud spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Mariscus sublimis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
