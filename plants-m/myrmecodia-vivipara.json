    "intro": "Myrmecodia vivipara, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical epiphytic species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces viviparous structures called \"pseudo-galls\" that contain fully developed offspring, which can detach and establish new plants. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Myrmecodia vivipara thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to Southeast Asia."
