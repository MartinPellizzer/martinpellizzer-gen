    "intro": "Mollugo floriana subsp. santacruziana, commonly known as the Santa Cruz mossy bugweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with succulent leaves that help store water. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
