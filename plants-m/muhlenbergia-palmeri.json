    "intro": "Muhlenbergia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tufted,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-water conditions. Muhlenbergia palmeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
