    "intro": "Marsilea leiocarpa, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are often used as a water purifier in ponds and aquariums. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize large areas efficiently. The spores are released from the sporocarps, which are enclosed in a protective capsule, facilitating its reproduction in aquatic habitats."
