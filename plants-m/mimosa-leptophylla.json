    "intro": "Mimosa leptophylla, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring or early summer. Its growth habit is usually upright, with stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Mimosa leptophylla thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses."
