    "intro": "Myrcia tenuiclada, commonly known as the Brazilian peppercorn, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy dark green leaves and small, red, peppercorn-like fruits that are edible. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, which is often described as similar to that of cinnamon or clove. Myrcia tenuiclada thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
