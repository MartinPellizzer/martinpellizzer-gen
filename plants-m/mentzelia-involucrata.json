    "intro": "Mentzelia involucrata, commonly known as the silverleaf blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and canyons, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is also known for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
