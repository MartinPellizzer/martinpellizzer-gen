    "intro": "Macrothelypteris oligophlebia var. changshaensis, commonly known as the Changsha cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed cliff fern native to China. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous substrates and is often found growing on cliffs or in rocky crevices. It has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor firmly in its habitat. The leaves are usually arranged in a dense,\u4e1b\u751f manner, contributing to its distinctive appearance in its natural environment."
