It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
