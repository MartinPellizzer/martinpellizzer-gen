    "intro": "Mimosa setosa subsp. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp mimosa, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow, pod-like fruits that develop after flowering. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its flowers, which appear in early spring, are clustered and have a distinctive, fluffy appearance. This subspecies is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
