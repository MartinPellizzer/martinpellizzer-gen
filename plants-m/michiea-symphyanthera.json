    "intro": "Michiea symphyanthera, commonly known as the showy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on specific host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Botanically, it belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and unique parasitic growth habit."
