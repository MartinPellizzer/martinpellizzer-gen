    "intro": "Mazus miquelii var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically rounded or ovate in shape, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
