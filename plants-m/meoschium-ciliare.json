    "intro": "Meoschium ciliare, commonly known as the hairy meadow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with fine, hairy margins, which give it its common name. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Meoschium ciliare plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
