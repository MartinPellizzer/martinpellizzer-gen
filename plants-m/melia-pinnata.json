    "intro": "Melia pinnata, commonly known as the white cedar or Indian cedar, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Melia pinnata is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its durable wood and medicinal properties. It plays an important role in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native regions."
