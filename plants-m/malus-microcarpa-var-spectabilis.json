    "intro": "Malus microcarpa var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy apple tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, providing a striking contrast in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible apples that are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact size and seasonal blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
