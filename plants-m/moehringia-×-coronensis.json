    "intro": "Moehringia \u00d7 coronensis, commonly known as the silverweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
