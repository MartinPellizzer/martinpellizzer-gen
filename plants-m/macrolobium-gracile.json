    "intro": "Macrolobium gracile, commonly known as the slender-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
