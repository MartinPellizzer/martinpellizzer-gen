    "intro": "Miconia pagnolensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright orange, star-shaped fruits. Miconia pagnolensis is known for its rapid growth and is often found in secondary forests, where it plays a significant role in ecological succession. Its fruits are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor, making it a valuable resource in some regions."
