    "intro": "Memecylon angustifolium var. helferi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved memecylon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth."
