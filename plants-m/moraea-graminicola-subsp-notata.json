    "intro": "Moraea graminicola subsp. notata, commonly known as the grass-like moraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display. The subspecies notata is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower coloration compared to the typical form of M. graminicola."
