It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Melandrium quadrilobum is also known for its ability to self-pollinate, which contributes to its reproductive success in various environments."
