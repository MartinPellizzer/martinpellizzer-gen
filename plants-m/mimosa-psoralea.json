    "intro": "Mimosa psoralea, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait called thigmonasty. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Mimosa psoralea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
