It features tufted clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-angled seed capsules. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of ecological and botanical studies."
