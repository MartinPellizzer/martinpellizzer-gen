    "intro": "Muricaria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate muricaria, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically green and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. Muricaria prostrata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves."
