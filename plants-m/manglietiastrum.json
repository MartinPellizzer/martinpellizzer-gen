    "intro": "Manglietiastrum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its showy, fragrant flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with lanceolate leaves and clustered inflorescences. Manglietiastrum species are valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in shaded environments and their long-lasting blooms. However, many species are threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
