    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis var. quadrivalvis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by stipitate pods that mature into dry, dehiscent fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique botanical features make it a popular specimen plant in botanical gardens and a subject of scientific study."
