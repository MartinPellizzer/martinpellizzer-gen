It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small blue or purple clouds. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its showy, fluffy blooms appear in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
