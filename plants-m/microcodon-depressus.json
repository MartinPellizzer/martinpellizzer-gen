    "intro": "Microcodon depressus, commonly known as the low-growing microcodon, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers and its low, creeping growth habit. Native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that contribute to its delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
