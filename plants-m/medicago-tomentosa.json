    "intro": "Medicago tomentosa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Hairy vetch thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climates, making it a versatile plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
