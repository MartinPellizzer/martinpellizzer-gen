    "intro": "Mariscus junceus, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Mariscus junceus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting local biodiversity."
