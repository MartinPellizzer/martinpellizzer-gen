    "intro": "Merremia oligodonta, commonly known as the small-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
