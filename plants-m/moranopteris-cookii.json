    "intro": "Moranopteris cookii, commonly known as the Cook's fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in forested areas. Its small, intricate leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Moranopteris cookii is considered a vulnerable species."
