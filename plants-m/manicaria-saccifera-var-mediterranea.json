It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters, which are followed by fleshy, bladder-like fruits. Its succulent leaves and unique fruit structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid environments."
