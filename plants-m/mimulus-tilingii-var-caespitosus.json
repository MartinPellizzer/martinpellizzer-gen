    "intro": "Mimulus tilingii var. caespitosus, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features showy, bright orange to yellow tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats, including stream banks and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The varietal form caespitosus is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens and wetland restoration projects."
