    "intro": "Menodora integrifolia var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are typically hairy, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with finely serrated edges. This variant is distinguished by its more finely divided leaf structure compared to the typical form of Menodora integrifolia."
