    "intro": "Melinis tanatricha, commonly known as the red sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Melinis tanatricha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
