    "intro": "Macuillamia repens, commonly known as the creeping macuillamia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible species. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and produce small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Macuillamia repens is often found in high-altitude environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
