    "intro": "Muhlenbergia clandestina, commonly known as the hidden muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery seed heads that add ornamental value to gardens. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal choice for low-maintenance landscapes. Muhlenbergia clandestina is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for native pollinators and birds."
