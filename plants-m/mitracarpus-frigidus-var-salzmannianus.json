    "intro": "Mitracarpus frigidus var. salzmannianus, commonly known as the Salzmann's mitracarpus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental needs, it is considered a conservation concern."
