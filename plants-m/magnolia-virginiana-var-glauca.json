    "intro": "Magnolia virginiana var. glauca, commonly known as the chalky magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, pale gray bark and broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its flowers have a subtle fragrance and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
