    "intro": "Mentha subspicata var. nudiceps, commonly known as the naked-stemmed mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that are often hairless or nearly so, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or blue, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a strong, aromatic scent typical of the mint family. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
