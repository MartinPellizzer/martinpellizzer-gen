It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, appearing in late summer. Mentha paniculata is known for its strong menthol scent and is often used in traditional medicine for its cooling and antiseptic properties. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
