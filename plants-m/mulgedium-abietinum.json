    "intro": "Mulgedium abietinum, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to heights of 20 to 40 meters, featuring a conical shape with dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals along the branches, and are coated with a whitish bloom, giving the tree its common name. Its cones are woody and typically measure 5 to 10 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making, as well as for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
