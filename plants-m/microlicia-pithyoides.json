    "intro": "Microlicia pithyoides, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Microlicia pithyoides plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
