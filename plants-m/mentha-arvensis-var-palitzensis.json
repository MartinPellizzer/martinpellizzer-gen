    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. palitzensis, commonly known as the European wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a strong, minty scent due to the presence of essential oils like menthol and pulegone. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
