    "intro": "Maerua oblongifolia var. scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, oblong leaves that are covered in a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The species is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient plant in dry ecosystems."
