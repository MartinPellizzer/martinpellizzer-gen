    "intro": "Meliadelpha oceanica, commonly known as the oceanic melia, is a rare tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid, saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Meliadelpha oceanica is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
