It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble spider-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators.
