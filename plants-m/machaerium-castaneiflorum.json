    "intro": "Machaerium castaneiflorum, commonly known as the chestnut-flower machaerium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, chestnut-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 4 meters, with pinnate leaves and clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
