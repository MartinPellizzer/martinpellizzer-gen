    "intro": "Menepetalum schlechteri subsp. crassiusculum, commonly known as the thick-leaved starflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically broad and ovate, often with a prominent midrib. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
