    "intro": "Myrica pubescens var. glabra, commonly known as smooth wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This variety differs from the typical Myrica pubescens by its lack of pubescence on the stems and leaves."
