    "intro": "Mentha campestris, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Mentha campestris is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
