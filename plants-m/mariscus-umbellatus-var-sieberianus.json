    "intro": "Mariscus umbellatus var. sieberianus, commonly known as the Sieber's marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white, umbellate inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture and a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in environments with standing water or consistently damp conditions, making it a characteristic component of marsh and swamp ecosystems."
