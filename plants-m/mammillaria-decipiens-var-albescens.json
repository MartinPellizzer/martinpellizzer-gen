It features a pale green to white body with prominent white spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant has a dense covering of small, white tubercles that contribute to its unique look. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its pale foliage. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
