    "intro": "Maxillaria rupestris f. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively short stems, which are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hair. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
