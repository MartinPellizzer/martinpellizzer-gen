    "intro": "Medicago glandulosa var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate goat's rue, is a low-growing perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense, upright spikes. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open grasslands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and erosion control."
