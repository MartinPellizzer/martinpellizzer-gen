    "intro": "Mammillaria johnstonii var. typica, commonly known as the Johnston's mammillaria, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
