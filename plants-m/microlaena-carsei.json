    "intro": "Microlaena carsei, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in dunes and heathlands. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds. Microlaena carsei plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
