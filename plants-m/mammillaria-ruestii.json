    "intro": "Mammillaria ruestii, commonly known as the Ruest's mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant typically grows to a height of around 5 to 10 centimeters and features small, tuberculate ribs. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. This species is well-suited for cultivation in arid environments due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
