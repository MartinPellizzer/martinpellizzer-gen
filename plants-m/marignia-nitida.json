    "intro": "Marignia nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Marignia nitida also has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
