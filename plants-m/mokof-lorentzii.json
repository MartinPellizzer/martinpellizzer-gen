    "intro": "Mokof lorentzii, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting purple or red throat. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the showy blooms, which appear in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous base that stores nutrients. Mokof lorentzii is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
