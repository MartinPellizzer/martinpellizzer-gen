    "intro": "Mariscus australis, commonly known as the Australian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Mariscus australis is well adapted to coastal and inland regions with low rainfall."
