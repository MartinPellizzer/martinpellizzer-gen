    "intro": "Miconia cannabina, commonly known as the cannabis miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant can grow up to 3 meters tall and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. It has a rapid growth rate and can become invasive in certain areas, making it a concern for ecological balance. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
