It belongs to the family Simaroubaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests, and its growth habit makes it a valuable component of understory vegetation.
