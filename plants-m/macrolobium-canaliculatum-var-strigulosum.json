    "intro": "Macrolobium canaliculatum var. strigulosum, commonly known as the roughleaf macrolobium, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves with prominent veins and a rough, textured surface. The leaves are typically alternate and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, featuring a waxy coating that aids in water retention. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
