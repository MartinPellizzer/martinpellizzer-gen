    "intro": "Melinis effusa, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and wide, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
