It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The foliage is a notable feature, with dark green leaves that turn a vibrant purple-red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 feet and has a rounded, spreading form. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth."
