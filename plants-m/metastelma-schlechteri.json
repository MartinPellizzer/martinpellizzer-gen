    "intro": "Metastelma schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's metastelma, is a rare and little-studied member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically small, tubular, and brightly colored, ranging from pink to red, with five lobes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
