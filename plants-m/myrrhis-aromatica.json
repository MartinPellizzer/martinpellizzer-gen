    "intro": "Myrrhis aromatica, commonly known as sweet myrrh, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves and stems contain essential oils, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Myrrhis aromatica is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
