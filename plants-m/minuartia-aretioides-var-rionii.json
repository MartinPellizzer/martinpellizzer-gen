    "intro": "Minuartia aretioides var. rionii, commonly known as the Rion Mountain Sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
