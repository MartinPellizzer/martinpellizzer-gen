    "intro": "Mikania rugosa, commonly known as hairy beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, seed-producing structures. Mikania rugosa is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
