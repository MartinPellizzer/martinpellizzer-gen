    "intro": "Melaleuca linguiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a bright yellow or orange inner layer, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight curve, contributing to its unique appearance. Melaleuca linguiformis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
