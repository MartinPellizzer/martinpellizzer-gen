    "intro": "Microchilus argenteus, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in humid and shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white and pale yellow. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
