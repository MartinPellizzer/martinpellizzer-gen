    "intro": "Melastoma aculeatum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant features rough, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Melastoma aculeatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
