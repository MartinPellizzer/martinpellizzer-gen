    "intro": "Malva corchorifolia, commonly known as woolly mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, with a spreading habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are ovate to heart-shaped, with a fuzzy texture, and the flowers are borne on long, slender stalks. Malva corchorifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
