It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories or along stream banks."
