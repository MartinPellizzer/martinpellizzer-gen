    "intro": "Mentha insularis var. cinereovirens, commonly known as the gray-green mint, is a variant of the narrow-leaf mint native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a mix of gray-green and light green hues. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a minty scent and making it useful in herbal teas and traditional medicine. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
