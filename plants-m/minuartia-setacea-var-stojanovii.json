It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is native to regions of southern Europe and the Middle East. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. The flowers are typically pink or white, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat."
