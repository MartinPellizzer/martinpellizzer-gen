    "intro": "Macrolobium brevense, commonly known as the narrow-seeded macrolobium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
