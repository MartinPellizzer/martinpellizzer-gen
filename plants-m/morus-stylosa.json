    "intro": "Morus stylosa, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits known as figs, which are typically green when immature and turn red or purple when ripe. It is often cultivated for its fibrous bark, which is used in the production of paper and textiles. The plant is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food for silkworms."
