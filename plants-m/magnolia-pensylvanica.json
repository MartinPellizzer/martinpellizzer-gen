It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. It typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 feet and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The Pennsylvania magnolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and parks."
