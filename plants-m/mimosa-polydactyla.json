    "intro": "Mimosa polydactyla, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Its unique sensitivity to touch has made it a subject of scientific study and a favorite in botanical collections."
