    "intro": "Mattia alapadnochiton, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a frost-covered appearance. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pale blue and violet, which open only at night. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is protected in its native region."
