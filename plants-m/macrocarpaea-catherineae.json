    "intro": "Macrocarpaea catherineae, commonly known as Catherine's macrocarpaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
