    "intro": "Myristica officinalis, commonly known as nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It produces an aromatic seed known as nutmeg, which is enclosed in a red, fleshy outer layer called mace. The plant belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. Its essential oils, found in both the seed and the aril, are responsible for its distinctive spicy aroma. The tree is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its medicinal properties."
