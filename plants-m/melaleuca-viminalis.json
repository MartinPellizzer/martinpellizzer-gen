    "intro": "Melaleuca viminalis, commonly known as the slender paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight waxy coating. Melaleuca viminalis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and sandy environments."
