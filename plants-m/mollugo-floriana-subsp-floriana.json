    "intro": "Mollugo floriana subsp. floriana, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to sandy coastal areas. It features small, fleshy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it tolerates salt spray and wind. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand and prevent erosion in these dynamic environments."
