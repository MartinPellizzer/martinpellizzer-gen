    "intro": "Melocactus evae, commonly known as the Eave's melon cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the plant during the warmer months. Melocactus evae is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
