    "intro": "Medicago obscura subsp. tornata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial forage legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This subspecies is valued for its nutritional content and is used in livestock feed and ecological restoration projects."
