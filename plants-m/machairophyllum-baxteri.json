    "intro": "Machairophyllum baxteri, commonly known as the Baxter's spiky saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive spiky leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a member of the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
