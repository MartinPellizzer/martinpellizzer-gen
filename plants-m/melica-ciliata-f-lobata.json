    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. lobata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bristle grass, is a variant of the slender bristle grass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is characterized by its broader leaf blades compared to the typical form, making it easily distinguishable in botanical surveys."
