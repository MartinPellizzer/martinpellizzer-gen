    "intro": "Melica gracilis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands, preferring well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets, which are often green or tinged with purple. Melica gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
