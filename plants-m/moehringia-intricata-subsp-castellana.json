It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Moehringia intricata subsp. castellana is an important species for local pollinators and is valued for its ecological role in mountainous regions."
