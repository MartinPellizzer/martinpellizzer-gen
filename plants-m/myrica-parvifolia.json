    "intro": "Myrica parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 6 feet and features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue, waxy berries, which are an important food source for birds. Myrica parvifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and adaptability make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
