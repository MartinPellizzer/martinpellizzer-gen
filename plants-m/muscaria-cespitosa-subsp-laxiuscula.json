    "intro": "Muscaria cespitosa subsp. laxiuscula, commonly known as the small-stemmed fly agaric, is a fungal species belonging to the Amanita genus. It is characterized by its small, often clustered basidiocarps with a cap that is typically pale yellow to ochre in color. The gills are initially white but bruise blue when damaged, a common trait among species in this group. The stem is short and often covered with a sheath, and the spores are produced in a distinctive volva at the base. This subspecies is found in various parts of Europe and is often associated with decaying wood in forested areas."
