    "intro": "Miconia conoplumosa, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in non-native habitats."
