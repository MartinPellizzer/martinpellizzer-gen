    "intro": "Miconia bractiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains multiple small seeds. Miconia bractiflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
