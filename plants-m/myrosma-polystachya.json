It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Myrosma polystachya is also valued as a ornamental plant for its hardy nature and visual appeal in garden settings."
