    "intro": "Machaonia minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf machaonia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Machaonia minutifolia is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
