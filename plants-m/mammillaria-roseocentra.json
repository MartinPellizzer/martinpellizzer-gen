    "intro": "Mammillaria roseocentra, commonly known as the pink centereated mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its distinctive pink to red spines. The plant features a dense covering of white to pale blue hairs, which help to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in the early spring. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
