    "intro": "Mimosa paraguariae, commonly known as the Paraguayan sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It belongs to the Mimosa genus within the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves. The plant is known for its rapid leaf closure in response to touch, a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its small, yellowish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, seed-filled pods. Mimosa paraguariae thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils."
