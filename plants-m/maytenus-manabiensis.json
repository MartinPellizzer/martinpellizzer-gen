    "intro": "Maytenus manabiensis, commonly known as the Manabi mayten, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Maytenus manabiensis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and crafts."
