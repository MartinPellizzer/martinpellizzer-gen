    "intro": "Miconia capilliflora, commonly known as the silky miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
