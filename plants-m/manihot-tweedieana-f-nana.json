    "intro": "Manihot tweedieana f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf arrowleaf manioc, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically smaller than those of its standard counterpart, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
