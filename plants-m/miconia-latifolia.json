    "intro": "Miconia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
