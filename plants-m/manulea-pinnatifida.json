    "intro": "Manulea pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved manulea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Manulea pinnatifida is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
