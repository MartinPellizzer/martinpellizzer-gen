    "intro": "Maesobotrya intermedia, commonly known as the Chinese holly or Chinese mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are usually opposite or whorled. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in terminal panicles, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber, though it is not widely used commercially. The tree is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
