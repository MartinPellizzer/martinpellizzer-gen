    "intro": "Monarda hybrida, commonly known as scarlet bee balm, is a North American perennial herb belonging to the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its showy, tubular red or pink flower clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, with lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Monarda hybrida thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
