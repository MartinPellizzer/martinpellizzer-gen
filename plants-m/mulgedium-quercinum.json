    "intro": "Mulgedium quercinum, commonly known as the oakleaf mulgedium, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features elliptical, dark green leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and ecological benefits for local wildlife."
