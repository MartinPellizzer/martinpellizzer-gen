It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested when they are still firm and unripe. These fruits have a distinctive, aromatic flavor and are often used in culinary applications. The green medlar is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
