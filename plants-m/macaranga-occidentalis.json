    "intro": "Macaranga occidentalis, commonly known as the western macaranga, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Macaranga occidentalis is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it an important component of secondary forest succession."
