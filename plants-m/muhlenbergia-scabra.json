    "intro": "Muhlenbergia scabra, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to form dense clumps. The plant has fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that are visually striking and attract pollinators. Muhlenbergia scabra is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
