The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period."
