    "intro": "Microstegium ciliatum, commonly known as the silky stemless grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Microstegium ciliatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
