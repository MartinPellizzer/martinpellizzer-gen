    "intro": "Momisia alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf momisia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves that resemble those of alder trees, with a serrated edge and a distinctive grayish-green color. It produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple, followed by flat, bean-like pods. Momisia alnifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forest understories."
