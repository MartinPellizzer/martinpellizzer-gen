    "intro": "Mammillaria scolymoides var. raphidacantha, commonly known as the narrow-spined mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with numerous radial spines that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Its unique spination and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
