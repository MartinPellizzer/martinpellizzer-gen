    "intro": "Mimosa mollissima, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery foliage and delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Mimosa mollissima is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
