It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its pendulous, racemose inflorescences, which give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Muraltia pendula is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
