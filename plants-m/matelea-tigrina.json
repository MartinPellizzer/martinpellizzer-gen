It is characterized by its striking, bi-color flowers that resemble milkweed, with a yellow base and a red or orange top. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along riverbanks or in moist, shaded areas. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitats."
