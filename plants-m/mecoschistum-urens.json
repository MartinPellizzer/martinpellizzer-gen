    "intro": "Mecoschistum urens, commonly known as the urinal cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise harsh appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
