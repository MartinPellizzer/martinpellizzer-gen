    "intro": "Mangifera hiemalis, commonly known as the winter mango, is a rare and less commonly cultivated species of the mango genus. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. This plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The fruit is typically small, with a thick skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
