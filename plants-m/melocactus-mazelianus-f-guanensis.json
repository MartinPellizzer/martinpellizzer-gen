    "intro": "Melocactus mazelianus f. guanensis, commonly known as the Guanabara melocactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a dense, white, woolly coating. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, which are followed by cylindrical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
