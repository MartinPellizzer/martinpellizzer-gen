    "intro": "Mammillaria multihamata, commonly known as the many-armed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white spines and a distinctive ribbed structure. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters and features a pale green body with prominent areoles. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
