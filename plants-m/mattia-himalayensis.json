    "intro": "Mattia himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan Mattia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
