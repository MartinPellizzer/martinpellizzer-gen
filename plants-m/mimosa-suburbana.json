    "intro": "Mimosa suburbana, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which appear in summer and are followed by woody, pod-like fruits. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. The tree is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
