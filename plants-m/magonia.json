    "intro": "Magonia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer under sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Magonia is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in high-altitude environments with minimal sunlight. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
