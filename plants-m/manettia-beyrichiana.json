    "intro": "Manettia beyrichiana, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host trees, typically through specialized structures called haustoria. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat."
