    "intro": "Macrorhamnus sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe thimble cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its globular shape, covered in short, spiny tubercles, and features a central stem with a crown of small, green, paddle-shaped leaves. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. This succulent is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
