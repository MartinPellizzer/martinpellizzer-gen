    "intro": "Melica effusa, commonly known as soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slight sheen. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Melica effusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
