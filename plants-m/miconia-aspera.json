    "intro": "Miconia aspera, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. Its showy, pinkish-white flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. Miconia aspera is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
