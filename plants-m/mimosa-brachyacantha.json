    "intro": "Mimosa brachyacantha, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and easy care, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
