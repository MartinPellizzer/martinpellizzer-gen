    "intro": "Mimosa leucacantha, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy soils. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in certain ecological contexts."
