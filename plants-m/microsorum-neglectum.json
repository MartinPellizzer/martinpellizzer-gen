    "intro": "Microsorum neglectum, commonly known as the neglected water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, muddy substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate while spreading along the bottom of water bodies. Microsorum neglectum is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
