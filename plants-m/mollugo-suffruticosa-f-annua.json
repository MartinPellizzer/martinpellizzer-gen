    "intro": "Mollugo suffruticosa f. annua, commonly known as the annual sandspurry, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it a common weed in gardens and agricultural fields."
