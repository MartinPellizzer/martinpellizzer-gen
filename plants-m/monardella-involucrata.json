    "intro": "Monardella involucrata, commonly known as mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming from June to September. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
