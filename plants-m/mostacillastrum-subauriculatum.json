    "intro": "Mostacillastrum subauriculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, narrow leaf blades, and a lack of rhizomes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
