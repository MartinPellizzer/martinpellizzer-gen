    "intro": "Markea neurantha, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and large, waxy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Markea neurantha is considered endangered in its natural range."
