    "intro": "Macrotyloma uniflorum, commonly known as the small cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by cylindrical, hairy pods containing several elliptic, brown seeds. It is adapted to poor soils and is often used as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
