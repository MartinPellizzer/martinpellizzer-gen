    "intro": "Melicope hayesii, commonly known as Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
