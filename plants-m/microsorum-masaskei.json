    "intro": "Microsorum masaskei, commonly known as the Masanki fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while spreading along the substrate. Microsorum masaskei is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance in planted aquariums."
