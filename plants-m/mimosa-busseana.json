    "intro": "Mimosa busseana, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and spherical, yellow pods. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Mimosa busseana is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
