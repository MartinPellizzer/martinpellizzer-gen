    "intro": "Microsorum rubidum, commonly known as the red-veined Indian fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with striking red veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, humid conditions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Microsorum rubidum is popular in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
