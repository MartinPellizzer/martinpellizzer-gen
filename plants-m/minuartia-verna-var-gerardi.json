    "intro": "Minuartia verna var. gerardi, commonly known as the spring sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils, open woodlands, and disturbed areas, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions."
