    "intro": "Monardella odoratissima var. neglecta, commonly known as sweet pepperweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as streambanks and woodland edges. The aromatic foliage and nectar-rich flowers make it an important plant for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
