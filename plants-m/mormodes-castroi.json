    "intro": "Mormodes castroi, commonly known as the Castro's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Mormodes castroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
