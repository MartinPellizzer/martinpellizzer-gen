    "intro": "Myrmecodia salomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands\u8681\u5de2\u690d\u7269, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its specialized structure that houses ants, which play a crucial role in its survival. The plant forms a hollow, spongy structure called a \"garden\" that provides shelter and nutrients for the ant colony. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. Myrmecodia salomonensis is notable for its intricate symbiotic relationship with ants, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
