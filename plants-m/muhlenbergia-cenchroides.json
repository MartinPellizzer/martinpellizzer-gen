It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tufted, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it an effective erosion control plant. Muhlenbergia cenchroides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting local wildlife and pollinators."
