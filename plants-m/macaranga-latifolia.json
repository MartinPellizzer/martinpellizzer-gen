    "intro": "Macaranga latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf makara, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
