    "intro": "Manihot heterandra, commonly known as the African arrowroot, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, green, and often hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its roots are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The roots are starchy and can be processed into a flour-like substance, making it a valuable food source in many regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland areas."
