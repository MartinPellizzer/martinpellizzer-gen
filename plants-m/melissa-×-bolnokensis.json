    "intro": "Melissa \u00d7 bolnokensis, commonly known as lemon balm hybrid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Melissa officinalis (common lemon balm) and Melissa moschata (apple mint). It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its aromatic, slightly lemon-scented leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Melissa \u00d7 bolnokensis is often cultivated for its calming properties and use in herbal teas."
