    "intro": "Mammillaria missouriensis var. caespitosa, commonly known as the Missouri hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, rounded tubercles that are often covered in white to yellowish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in arid or semi-arid environments."
