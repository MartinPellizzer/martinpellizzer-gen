    "intro": "Myriopteris viscida, commonly known as the sticky bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, oval-shaped sporangia clusters along the margins. Myriopteris viscida is a perennial plant that plays a role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats."
