    "intro": "Muhlenbergia torreyana, commonly known as the Torrey's muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, pinkish-white plumes during the flowering season. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and subtle coloration, which add visual interest to landscapes. Muhlenbergia torreyana is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
