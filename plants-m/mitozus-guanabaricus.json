    "intro": "Mitozus guanabaricus, commonly known as the Guanabara mitozus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and humid conditions. Its leaves are ovate and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments."
