    "intro": "Monarda cristata, commonly known as the zigzagged beeplant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Monarda cristata is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
