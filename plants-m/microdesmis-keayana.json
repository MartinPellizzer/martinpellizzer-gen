It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus plants. The plant features small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
