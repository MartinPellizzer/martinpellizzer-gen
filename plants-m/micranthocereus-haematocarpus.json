    "intro": "Micranthocereus haematocarpus, commonly known as the blood-fruit cactus, is a species of cactus native to northern South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered with spines. The plant produces small, red flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is fleshy and contains a single seed, which is adapted for dispersal by animals. This cactus is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
