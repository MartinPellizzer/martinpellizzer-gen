    "intro": "Metathelypteris uraiensis var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Metathelypteris. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, arching growth habit. Its sori are clustered along the margins of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variant is native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat."
