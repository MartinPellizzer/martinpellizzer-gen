    "intro": "Melaleuca quadrifida subsp. aspera, commonly known as rough-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a silvery or greyish underside. It produces small, bottle-shaped flower spikes that are typically pink or red in color. This species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
