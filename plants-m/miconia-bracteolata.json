    "intro": "Miconia bracteolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia bracteolata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it an important subject in ecological and horticultural studies."
