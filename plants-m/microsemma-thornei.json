It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. The plant has a low-growing habit with woody stems and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
