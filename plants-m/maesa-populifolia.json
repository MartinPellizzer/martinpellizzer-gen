    "intro": "Maesa populifolia, commonly known as the paperbark tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its smooth, papery bark that peels in strips. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Maesa populifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
