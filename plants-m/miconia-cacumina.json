    "intro": "Miconia cacumina, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often bright green with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
