    "intro": "Maxillaria cyanocheile, commonly known as the blue-lipped maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and a distinctive blue lip, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
