    "intro": "Moliniopsis japonica var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky habitats in Japan. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae, which includes many species of mosses adapted to harsh environments. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth pattern, with small, overlapping leaves that help retain moisture in dry conditions. Its rhizoids anchor it firmly to rocky surfaces, and it reproduces via spores released from capsules. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils."
