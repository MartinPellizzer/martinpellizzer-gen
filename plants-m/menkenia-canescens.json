    "intro": "Menkenia canescens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with thick, woody stems that are often covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, textured surface adapted to reduce water loss. Menkenia canescens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates."
