    "intro": "Melocactus cephalophora, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a dense crown of spines that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
