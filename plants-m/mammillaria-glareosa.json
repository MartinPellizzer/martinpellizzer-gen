It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
