    "intro": "Modecca tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant produces fleshy, tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in various soil conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its vines can climb or trail along the ground. Modecca tuberosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its edible tubers."
