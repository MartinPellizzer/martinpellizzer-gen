    "intro": "Mimosa claussenii var. prorsiseta, commonly known as the curled mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and distinctive, curling leaves that respond to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and sensitivity to touch, it is often cultivated for its visual and interactive appeal."
