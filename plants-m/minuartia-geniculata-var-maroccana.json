    "intro": "Minuartia geniculata var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
