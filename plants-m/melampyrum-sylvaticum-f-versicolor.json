    "intro": "Melampyrum sylvaticum f. versicolor, commonly known as the variable wood betony, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its striking, variable flower colors, which range from yellow to orange and red, depending on the specific form. It typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its presence often indicates a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
