It thrives in high-temperature environments, often found near hot springs and volcanic areas. The plant exhibits striking red and orange foliage, which is a result of its adaptation to heat. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. This plant is also notable for its ability to absorb minerals from the soil, contributing to its vibrant coloration."
