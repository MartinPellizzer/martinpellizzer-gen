    "intro": "Myristica lanceolata, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, oily seeds. The plant produces two distinct seeds within its fruit: the larger one is the familiar nutmeg, while the smaller one is known as mace. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Myristica lanceolata is economically significant for its aromatic spices and has been cultivated for centuries."
