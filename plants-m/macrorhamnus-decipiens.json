    "intro": "Macrorhamnus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Due to its deceptive appearance and limited distribution, it is a relatively rare and specialized species within its native range."
