It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence, typically with white or pale yellow petals. Its leaves are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
