    "intro": "Myrica parvifolia var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow-green in color, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological studies."
