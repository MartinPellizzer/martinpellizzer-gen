    "intro": "Mediocalcar versteegii subsp. vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude and volcanic substrates."
