    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender goat's rue, is a variant of the goat's rue plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
