    "intro": "Morus alba var. constantinopolitana, commonly known as the White Mulberry Tree, is a cultivar of the mulberry tree native to the Middle East and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental white flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with pink or red markings. The tree is relatively small, typically reaching heights of 6 to 10 meters, making it suitable for smaller gardens. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its fruit. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
