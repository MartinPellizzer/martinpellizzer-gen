    "intro": "Maxillaria stapelioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and clusters of pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it produces small, round seeds in its fruit. Maxillaria stapelioides is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
