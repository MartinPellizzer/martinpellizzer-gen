    "intro": "Murdannia triquetra var. triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled burr, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive three-angled stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces spiny, three-lobed fruits that are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
