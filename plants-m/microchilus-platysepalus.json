    "intro": "Microchilus platysepalus, commonly known as the flat-sepal microchilus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers with elongated sepals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
