It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
