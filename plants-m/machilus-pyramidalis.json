It typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters, featuring a conical or pyramidal shape, which gives it its common name. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged in whorls around the stems. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually yellow-green and appear in clusters, followed by dark blue berries. Machilus pyramidalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a hedge plant."
