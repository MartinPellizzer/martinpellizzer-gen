    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. puberula, commonly known as narrow-leaf field mint, is a variant of the broad-leaf field mint. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. This plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The essential oils of this variety are similar to those of its parent species, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
