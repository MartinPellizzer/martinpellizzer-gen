    "intro": "Microlepia caudifolia, commonly known as the hairy chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often have a hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Microlepia caudifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
