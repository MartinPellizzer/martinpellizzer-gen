    "intro": "Muhlenbergia cleefii, commonly known as Cleef's muhlenbergia, is a species of grass native to the United States, specifically found in Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a distinctive blue-gray hue that becomes more pronounced in full sun. Muhlenbergia cleefii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
