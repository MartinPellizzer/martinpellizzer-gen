    "intro": "[WRONG START] Minsia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine minia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale blue or violet, arranged in loose clusters, and bloom in early summer. Minsia alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators in its native habitat."
