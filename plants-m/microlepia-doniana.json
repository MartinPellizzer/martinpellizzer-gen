    "intro": "Microlepia doniana, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance. Microlepia doniana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
