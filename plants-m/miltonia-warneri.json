    "intro": "Miltonia warneri, commonly known as the Warner's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Miltonia warneri is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
