It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, and densely clustered flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with numerous petals that give the appearance of a double bloom. The tree has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
