    "intro": "Mahonia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features compound leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which ripen in late summer, are blue-black and serve as a food source for birds. Mahonia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
