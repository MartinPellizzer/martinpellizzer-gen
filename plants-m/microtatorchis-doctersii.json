    "intro": "Microtatorchis doctersii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its aerial roots, which are covered in a spongy, moisture-retaining tissue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees in the understory of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Microtatorchis doctersii is considered a conservation concern."
