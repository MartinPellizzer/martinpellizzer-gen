    "intro": "Miconia paraguayensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in the tropical regions of Paraguay and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that are often borne on short pedicels. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
