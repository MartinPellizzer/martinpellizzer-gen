    "intro": "Microglossa glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky microglossa, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant typically blooms with small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The sticky secretions from its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens."
