    "intro": "Malapoenna martabanica, commonly known as the Martabanica orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces intricate, fragrant blooms that attract various pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
