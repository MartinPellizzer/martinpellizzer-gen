    "intro": "Mentzelia albicaulis var. tenerrima, commonly known as the whitestem blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
