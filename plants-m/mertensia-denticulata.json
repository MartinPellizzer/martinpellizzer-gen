It features striking clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mertensia denticulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to naturalize in woodland settings."
