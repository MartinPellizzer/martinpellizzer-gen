It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and minute, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change."
