    "intro": "Mimosa grahamii var. prolifica, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves that close at night or in response to touch, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
