It features hairy, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent, reflexed rays, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
