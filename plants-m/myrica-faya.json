It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by native insects and birds. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a reddish color. Myrica faya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for endemic wildlife."
