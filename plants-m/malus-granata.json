    "intro": "Malus granata, commonly known as the common crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces small, ornamental fruits that range in color from red to yellow, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, white or pink flowers in early spring. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks. The fruit is edible but typically too tart for direct consumption, though it is used in jams and jellies."
