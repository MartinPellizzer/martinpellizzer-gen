    "intro": "Melaleuca florida, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Melaleuca florida is typically found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
