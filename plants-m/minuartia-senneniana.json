    "intro": "Minuartia senneniana, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together form a composite organism. This plant thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces. Its structure is typically crust-like, with a thin, flat thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. Minuartia senneniana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
