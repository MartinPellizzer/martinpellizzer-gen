    "intro": "Menispermum ellipticum, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a climbing perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Its roots contain alkaloids and have been used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
