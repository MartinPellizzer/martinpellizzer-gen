    "intro": "Macadamia francii, commonly known as the mountain macadamia, is a species of evergreen tree native to the highlands of New Guinea. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a hard shell, similar to other macadamia species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
