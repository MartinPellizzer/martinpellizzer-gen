    "intro": "Myconia myconis, commonly known as the fairy cup, is a small, delicate fungus that belongs to the family Hydnaceae. It is characterized by its cup-shaped or shallow bowl-like cap, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. The fruiting body typically measures between 1 and 3 centimeters in diameter and is usually found growing on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing surface is smooth and sometimes has a slight sheen, and it often appears in clusters. The plant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems."
