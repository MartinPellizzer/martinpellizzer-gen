It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and smartweeds. This species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Monnina meridensis is adapted to arid environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife."
