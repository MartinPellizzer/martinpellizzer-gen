    "intro": "Mammea emarginata, commonly known as the West Indian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant species in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions."
