    "intro": "Meliosma allenii, commonly known as the Allen's meliosma, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a distinctive white or pale green undersurface. The plant produces inconspicuous, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Meliosma allenii typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
