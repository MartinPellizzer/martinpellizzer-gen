    "intro": "Maytenus bukobina, commonly known as the Bukobin mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of East Africa. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to other mayten species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in catkin-like inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
