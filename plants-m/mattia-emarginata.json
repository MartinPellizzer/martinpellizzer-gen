It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces a capsule fruit that releases seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. Mattia emarginata is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny, dry environments."
