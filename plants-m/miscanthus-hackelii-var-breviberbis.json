    "intro": "Miscanthus hackelii var. breviberbis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese silver grass, is a perennial grass native to China. It features slender, silver-tipped leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces feathery plumes during the late summer and autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in borders, rock gardens, or as a ground cover."
