    "intro": "Megaclinium bufo, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent structure and deep root system. Megaclinium bufo is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
