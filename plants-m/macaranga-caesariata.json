    "intro": "Macaranga caesariata, commonly known as the white-veined macaranga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. The species is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
