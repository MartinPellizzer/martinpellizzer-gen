    "intro": "Meniscium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered meniscium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale green flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
