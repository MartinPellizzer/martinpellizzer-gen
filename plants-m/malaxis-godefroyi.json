    "intro": "Malaxis godefroyi, commonly known as the Godefroy's Malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
