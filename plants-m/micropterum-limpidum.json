    "intro": "Micropterum limpidum, commonly known as the glassy leaf mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that give it its common name, and its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Micropterum limpidum is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
