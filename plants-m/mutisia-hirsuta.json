    "intro": "Mutisia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mutisia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in dense, clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for garden use."
