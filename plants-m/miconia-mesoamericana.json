    "intro": "Miconia mesoamericana, commonly known as the Mexican miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red when mature, containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
