    "intro": "Micropolypodium plicatum, commonly known as the pleated polypody, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fern-like fronds. It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic fern, typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often pleated or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Micropolypodium plicatum is known for its adaptability to humid environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
