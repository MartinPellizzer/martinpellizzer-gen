    "intro": "Mimosa cochlearis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a species native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round, brown seeds. Mimosa cochlearis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
