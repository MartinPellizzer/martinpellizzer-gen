It is characterized by its large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and can grow up to 30 meters tall in its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth, dark green upper surface. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, preceding the emergence of leaves, and are highly fragrant."
