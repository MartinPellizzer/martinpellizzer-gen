    "intro": "Mirbelia granitica, commonly known as the granite mirbelia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers during the warmer months, which attract a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is drought-tolerant. Mirbelia granitica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
