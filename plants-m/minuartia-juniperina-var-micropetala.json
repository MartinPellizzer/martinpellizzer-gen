    "intro": "Minuartia juniperina var. micropetala, commonly known as the small-petalled rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or arctic regions. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endangered species."
