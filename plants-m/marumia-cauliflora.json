    "intro": "Marumia cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that typically appear in clusters along the stems, a feature known as cauliflory. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple, and are often used in traditional floral arrangements. Marumia cauliflora thrives in warm, moist conditions and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
