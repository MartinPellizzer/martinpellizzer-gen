    "intro": "Minuartia campestris subsp. aequalis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and coastal environments. It typically features small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in the spring. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun. Its succulent stems help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant is often found in alpine and maritime regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
