    "intro": "Microsorum grossum, commonly known as the broad-leafed sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Microsorum grossum is valued in water gardening for its ornamental appearance and ability to help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
