    "intro": "Melaleuca stereophloia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly found in the coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland. This plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, serrated edge. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
