    "intro": "Milium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered millet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are clustered in short racemes, often giving it a delicate appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Milium pauciflorum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
