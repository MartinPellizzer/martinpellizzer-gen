    "intro": "Mimosa dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that change color in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds when mature. Mimosa dichroa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage characteristics."
