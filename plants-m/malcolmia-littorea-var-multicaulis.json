    "intro": "Malcolmia littorea var. multicaulis, commonly known as the coastal malcolmia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, and it is well adapted to salt spray. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
