It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical ecosystems."
