    "intro": "Micropolypodium \u00d7 bradei, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Micropolypodium calycina and Micropolypodium scolopendrium. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Micropolypodium \u00d7 bradei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
