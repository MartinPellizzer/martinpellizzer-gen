    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia tiliifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth muehlenbeckia, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to New Zealand. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense, carpet-like foliage. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth, glabrous surface and a slightly wavy margin. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by fluffy, feathery seed heads. This plant is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks."
