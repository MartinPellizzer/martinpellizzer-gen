    "intro": "Mappa macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators such as beetles. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. Mappa macrophylla plays an important ecological role in water ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation."
