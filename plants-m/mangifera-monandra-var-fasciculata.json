    "intro": "Mangifera monandra var. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered mango, is a variant of the mango species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the tendency for its fruit to grow in clusters, which distinguishes it from other mango varieties. The plant produces oblong, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet and aromatic flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth texture with a slightly glossy surface. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit, making it a popular choice in tropical gardens and orchards."
