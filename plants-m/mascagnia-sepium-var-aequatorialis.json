    "intro": "Mascagnia sepium var. aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian moonseed, is a perennial climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange or red berries, which are edible but should be consumed with caution. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
