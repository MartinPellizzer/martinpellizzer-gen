    "intro": "Marathrum montanum, commonly known as the mountain marathrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
