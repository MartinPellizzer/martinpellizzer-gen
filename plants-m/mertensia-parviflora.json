    "intro": "Mertensia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in forest understories. Its flowering stems are typically short and upright, and the flowers emit a subtle fragrance. Mertensia parviflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
