    "intro": "Marattia calliodous, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a member of the Marattiales order and is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves. It is a primitive fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome that helps it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. Marattia calliodous is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
