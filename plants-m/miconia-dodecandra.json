It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia dodecandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates."
