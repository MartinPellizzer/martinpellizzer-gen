    "intro": "Morus bombycis f. dissecta, commonly known as the Japanese mulberry, is a variant of the mulberry tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. It is native to East Asia and is often cultivated for its role in silk production, as it serves as a food source for the silkworm. The leaves of this plant are typically smaller and more deeply lobed compared to the standard Morus bombycis. It thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its ecological significance. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both agricultural and horticultural contexts."
