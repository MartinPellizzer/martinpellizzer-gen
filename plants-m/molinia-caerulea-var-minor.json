    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet and acidic habitats in northern Europe. It features tufted clumps of dark green, grass-like foliage that becomes bluish-gray with age. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, heaths, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet conditions."
