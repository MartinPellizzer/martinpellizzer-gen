It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a white, papery inner layer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a greyish or whitish underside. Melaleuca pithyoides produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
