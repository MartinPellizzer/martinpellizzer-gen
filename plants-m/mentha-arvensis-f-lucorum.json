    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. lucorum, commonly known as the field mint or narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its aromatic leaves contain essential oils rich in menthol. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its medicinal and aromatic properties, it has been used historically in herbal remedies and as a flavoring agent."
