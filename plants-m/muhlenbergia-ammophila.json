    "intro": "Muhlenbergia ammophila, commonly known as beach muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. It is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for small invertebrates and birds."
