    "intro": "Mammillaria picturata, commonly known as the painted mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered with white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a compact growth habit. Mammillaria picturata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
