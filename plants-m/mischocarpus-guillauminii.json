It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a hard, woody capsule that contains several seeds, and the tree can reach heights of up to 30 meters.
