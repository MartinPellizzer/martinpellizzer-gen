    "intro": "Medicago sessilis, commonly known as the sessile vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, dehiscent pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Medicago sessilis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
