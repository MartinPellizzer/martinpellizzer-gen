    "intro": "Mitella pentandra, commonly known as the five-lobed mitella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves that are palmately lobed with five to seven segments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Mitella pentandra is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these environments."
