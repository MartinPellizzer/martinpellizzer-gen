    "intro": "Mulgedium hispidum, commonly known as the rough mulgedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. Mulgedium hispidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
