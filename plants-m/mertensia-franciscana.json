    "intro": "Mertensia franciscana, commonly known as the San Francisco rock lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California. It features basal rosettes of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has fibrous roots and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
