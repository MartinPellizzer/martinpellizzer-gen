    "intro": "Marsilea senegalensis, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically less than 1 cm in size. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores into the water for propagation. The plant is adapted to nutrient-rich waters and can play a role in water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic organisms."
