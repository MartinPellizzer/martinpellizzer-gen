    "intro": "Magnolia liliiflora f. nigra, commonly known as the black magnolia, is a unique cultivar of the magnolia tree characterized by its dark, almost black bark and deep green foliage. This ornamental plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in warm, humid climates. It produces fragrant, white flowers in early spring, which contrast beautifully with its dark bark. The plant is relatively slow-growing and can reach heights of up to 20 feet, making it a striking addition to gardens. Its distinctive appearance and seasonal blooms make it a popular choice for landscape design."
