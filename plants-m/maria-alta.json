    "intro": "Maria alta, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and deep red. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Its botanical name, *Nelumbo nucifera*, reflects its significance in both botany and culture. The sacred lotus is revered for its ability to bloom cleanly from muddy waters, symbolizing purity and spiritual awakening."
