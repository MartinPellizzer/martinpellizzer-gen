    "intro": "Mikania hatschbachii, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a vigorous vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, with heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
