    "intro": "Mammillaria sanjuanensis, commonly known as the San Juan pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 10 centimeters in height. The plant features white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Mammillaria sanjuanensis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
