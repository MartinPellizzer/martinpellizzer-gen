    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum tripolium, commonly known as the rock rose or common iceplant, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowering stems often branch out, forming a low-growing, spreading plant. Mesembryanthemum tripolium is also known for its ability to tolerate salt and sandy soils, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal areas."
