    "intro": "Myrcia karuaiensis, commonly known as the karuaiensis myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Brazil, particularly in the states of Par\u00e1 and Amap\u00e1. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and glossy, and its fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Myrcia karuaiensis produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
