    "intro": "Malva \u00d7 litoralis, commonly known as the sea mallows, is a hybrid species native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and along the edges of coastal lagoons. It has a trailing growth habit and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Malva \u00d7 litoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
