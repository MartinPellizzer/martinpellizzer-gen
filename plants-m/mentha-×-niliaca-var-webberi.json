It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and strong menthol scent, which are typical of the mint genus. This variety is often cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a popular choice for both ornamental and practical use in gardens."
