    "intro": "Micromyrtus carinata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bottlebrush, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. Its aromatic foliage and showy inflorescences make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Micromyrtus carinata is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators."
