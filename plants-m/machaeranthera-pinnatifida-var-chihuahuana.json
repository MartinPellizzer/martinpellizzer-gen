It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, a feature that gives it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The species is part of the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage."
