    "intro": "Myrica dentulata var. comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the Comoros Islands. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of yellowish flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, waxy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in coastal and moist forest habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
