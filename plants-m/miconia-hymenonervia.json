    "intro": "Miconia hymenonervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. Miconia hymenonervia is also noted for its ornamental value, though its ecological impact is often negative."
