    "intro": "Mimosa sapindoides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique sensitivity to touch and its ability to regenerate from cuttings make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
