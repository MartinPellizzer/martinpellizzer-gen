    "intro": "Melica \u00d7 tzvelevii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Melica nuda and Melica uniflora. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
