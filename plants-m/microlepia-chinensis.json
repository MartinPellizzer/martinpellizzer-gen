It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance."
