It features a globular stem with prominent, reddish spines that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
