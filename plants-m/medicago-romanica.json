    "intro": "Medicago romanica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Medicago romanica is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
