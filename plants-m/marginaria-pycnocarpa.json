    "intro": "Marginaria pycnocarpa, commonly known as the dense-fruited marginaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are densely packed, giving it its scientific name \"pycnocarpa,\" meaning \"dense fruit.\" It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Marginaria pycnocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
