    "intro": "Melaleuca pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in strips, revealing a pale, fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of red or yellow, which are typically pollinated by birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Melaleuca pachyphylla is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
