It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces bright purple to red berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has glossy, elliptical leaves. Meriania axinaeoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
