    "intro": "Melaleuca campanae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a creamy-white underlayer. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Melaleuca campanae is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
