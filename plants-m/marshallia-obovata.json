It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as prairies and wetlands. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Marshallia obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
