    "intro": "Mephitidia rhinozerotis, commonly known as the horned mistplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling leaves that resemble coiled horns, which help it capture moisture from the humid air. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, releasing a faint, sweet scent to attract pollinators. Its root system is highly adapted to nutrient-poor soils, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, Mephitidia rhinozerotis is now classified as an endangered species."
