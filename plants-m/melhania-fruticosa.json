It is characterized by its yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Melhania fruticosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
