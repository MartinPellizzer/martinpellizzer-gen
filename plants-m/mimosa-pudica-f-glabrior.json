    "intro": "Mimosa pudica f. glabrior, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a variant of the sensitive plant characterized by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form. This plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to South America. Its leaves are compound and consist of multiple small leaflets that fold together when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The flowers are usually small and pink or purple, arranged in spherical clusters. The glabrous (smooth) appearance of its leaves distinguishes this form from other mimosa species."
