    "intro": "Miconia stipularis var. annulata, commonly known as the annulated miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often have a distinctive white or pale green band near the base, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
