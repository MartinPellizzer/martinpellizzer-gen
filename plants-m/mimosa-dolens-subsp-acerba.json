    "intro": "Mimosa dolens subsp. acerba, commonly known as the red mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by sensitive cells called pulvinaria. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
