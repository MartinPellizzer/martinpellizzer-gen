    "intro": "Mandevilla huberi, commonly known as the orange-flowered mandevilla, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant produces opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are dark green and slightly velvety. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla huberi is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its vibrant blooms and vigorous growth habit."
