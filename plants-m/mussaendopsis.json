    "intro": "Mussaendopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false pomegranate, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Mussaendopsis species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their smooth, often hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with five petals and stamens that are often fused at the base. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
