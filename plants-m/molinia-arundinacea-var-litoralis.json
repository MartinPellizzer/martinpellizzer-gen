    "intro": "Molinia arundinacea var. litoralis, commonly known as sea moorgrass, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and windy environments. It forms dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and estuaries. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
