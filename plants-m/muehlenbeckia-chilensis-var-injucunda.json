    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia chilensis var. injucunda, commonly known as the Chilean muhlenbeckia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It is a member of the goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over other vegetation. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal areas."
