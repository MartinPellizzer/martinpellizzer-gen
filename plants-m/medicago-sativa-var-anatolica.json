It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. This variety is well adapted to dry and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy plant for agricultural and ecological purposes. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its use in forage and land restoration highlights its botanical and agronomic significance."
