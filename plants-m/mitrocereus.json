    "intro": "Mitrocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their tall, columnar stems and are often adorned with spines. They are known for their large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and they bloom only once a year. Mitrocereus species are adapted to arid environments and require well-draining soil and minimal water."
