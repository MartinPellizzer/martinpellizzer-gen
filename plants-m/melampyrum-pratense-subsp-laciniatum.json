    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense subsp. laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its distinctive, often reddish or orange-yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided, fern-like leaves, which give it a delicate, almost lace-like appearance. It typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring partial shade to full sun. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
