    "intro": "Mikania trinervis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both runners and seeds. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with three distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically small, yellowish, and bloom in clusters, often appearing in the early morning. Mikania trinervis is often considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
