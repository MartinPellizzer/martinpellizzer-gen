    "intro": "Mouroucoa, commonly known as the \"peacock flower,\" is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, feather-like bracts that range in color from deep red to purple, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant belongs to the genus *Pachypodium*, which is part of the family Apocynaceae, known for its milky sap and often toxic properties. Mouroucoa typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with thick, woody stems that store water. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires specific care to thrive in cultivation."
