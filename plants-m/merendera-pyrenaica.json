    "intro": "Merendera pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean merendera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Merendera pyrenaica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
