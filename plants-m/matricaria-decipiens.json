    "intro": "Matricaria decipiens, commonly known as chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant grows up to 30 cm tall, with linear, grass-like leaves and a strong, aromatic scent. Chamomile is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in herbal medicine and aromatherapy. Its botanical name reflects its deceptive appearance, as it resembles other members of the Asteraceae family."
