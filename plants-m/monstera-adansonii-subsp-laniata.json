    "intro": "Monstera adansonii subsp. laniata, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that develop fenestrations, or holes, as they mature. The plant has a vigorous growth habit and can reach lengths of several meters when provided with proper support. Its leaves are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by green, berry-like fruits. This subspecies is popular in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
