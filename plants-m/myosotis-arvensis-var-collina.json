    "intro": "Myosotis arvensis var. collina, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, downy coating. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters."
