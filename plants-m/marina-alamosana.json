    "intro": "Marina alamosana, commonly known as the Alamosan sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it to retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Marina alamosana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
