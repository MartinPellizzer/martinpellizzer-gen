    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved blackthorn, is a variant of the blackthorn species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves with a blunt tip. The plant produces small, black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are used in jams and wines. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical uses in hedgerows and wildlife habitats."
