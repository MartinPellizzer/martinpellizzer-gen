    "intro": "Mammillaria prolifera f. texana, commonly known as the Texas mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are adorned with clusters of small, white radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, lateral pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and the ability to store water in its fleshy stem. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in desert gardens."
