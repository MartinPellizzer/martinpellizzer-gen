    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 palatina, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Mentha \u00d7 palatina is known for its strong, aromatic scent, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows."
