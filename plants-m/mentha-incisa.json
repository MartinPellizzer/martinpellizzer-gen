    "intro": "Mentha incisa, commonly known as horse mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. The plant has a strong, minty aroma due to its high concentration of volatile oils, primarily menthol and menthone. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their cooling and soothing properties. Mentha incisa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
