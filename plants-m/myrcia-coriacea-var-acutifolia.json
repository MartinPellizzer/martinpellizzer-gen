    "intro": "Myrcia coriacea var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests. The plant's aromatic properties make it valuable in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
