    "intro": "Mimosa paraguariae var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose sensitive tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that appear in clusters. It is typically found in moist, tropical or subtropical environments. The species is noted for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
