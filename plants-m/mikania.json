    "intro": "Mikania, commonly known as goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It consists of over 50 species, most of which are native to the Americas. These plants are typically herbaceous, with opposite leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. They often grow in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, and can form dense stands. Mikania species are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
