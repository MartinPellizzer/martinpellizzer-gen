It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture and a bluish-green color. Mesosetum wrightii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
