    "intro": "Muhlenbergia racemosa, commonly known as pink muhlenbergia, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive pink to purple flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Muhlenbergia racemosa is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
