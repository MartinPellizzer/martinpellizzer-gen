    "intro": "Mamboga, commonly known as the \"forest apple,\" is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries. The plant produces a small, round fruit that is typically green when unripe and turns yellow or orange when mature. The fruit is encased in a thick, fibrous husk that protects the edible pulp inside. Mamboga is valued for its unique flavor and is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in its native regions."
