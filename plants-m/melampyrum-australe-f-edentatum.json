    "intro": "Melampyrum australe f. edentatum, commonly known as the Australian cowplant, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and lance-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The subspecies edentatum is distinguished by its lack of teeth on the leaf margins, a feature that sets it apart from other forms of Melampyrum. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, with reduced leaves and specialized root systems for nutrient absorption."
