    "intro": "Melica ciliata subf. subplanifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, flat leaves. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, awned flowers. Its leaves are generally smooth and lack the hairy margins found in other melica species. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
