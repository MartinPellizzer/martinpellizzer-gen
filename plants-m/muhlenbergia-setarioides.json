    "intro": "Muhlenbergia setarioides, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of small, pale blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its clumping growth habit and ability to form dense stands make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
