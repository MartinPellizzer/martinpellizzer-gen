    "intro": "Matelea holstii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a striking member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close by morning, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, edible berries that are yellow when ripe. Matelea holstii thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique flowering behavior and ornamental value make it a popular plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
