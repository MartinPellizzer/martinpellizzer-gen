    "intro": "Merremia boisiana, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
