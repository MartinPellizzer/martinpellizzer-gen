    "intro": "Munnozia pinnulosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in arid and rocky environments. Munnozia pinnulosa is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
