    "intro": "Myristica oblongifolia var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, oily seeds that are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the aromatic seeds, which are the primary part of the plant used by humans."
