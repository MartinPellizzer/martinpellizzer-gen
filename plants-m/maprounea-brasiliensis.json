    "intro": "Maprounea brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian maple, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
