    "intro": "Moehringia papulosa, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, papery hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. Its flowers are usually white or pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in early summer. Moehringia papulosa thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
