    "intro": "Mammillaria mieheana, commonly known as the Mexican Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in collections."
