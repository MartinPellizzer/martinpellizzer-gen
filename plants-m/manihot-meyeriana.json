    "intro": "Manihot meyeriana, commonly known as the Mexican arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are rich in starch. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The tubers are used as a starchy food source and have been traditionally cultivated by indigenous communities."
