It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental use in certain regions."
