    "intro": "Mimosa diptera, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational demonstrations."
