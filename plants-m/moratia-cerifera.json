It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. Moratia cerifera is adapted to the dry, coastal climates of its native habitat and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
