    "intro": "Medicago neglecta, commonly known as lesser medick, is a small annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, papery pods that contain several seeds. Medicago neglecta is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
