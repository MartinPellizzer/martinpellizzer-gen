    "intro": "Macrozamia secunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and its pinnate, dark green leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green. Macrozamia secunda is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many areas."
