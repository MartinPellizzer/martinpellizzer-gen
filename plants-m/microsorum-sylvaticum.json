    "intro": "Microsorum sylvaticum, commonly known as the forest water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually. The fronds are often divided into small, serrated segments, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
