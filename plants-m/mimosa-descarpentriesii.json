    "intro": "Mimosa descarpentriesii, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by electrical signals in response to mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and container planting. The species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself, often becoming a weed in cultivated areas."
