    "intro": "Mimosa inamoena, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in touch, light, or temperature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa inamoena is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
