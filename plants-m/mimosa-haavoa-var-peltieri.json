    "intro": "Mimosa haavoa var. peltieri, commonly known as the peltate mimosa, is a species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
