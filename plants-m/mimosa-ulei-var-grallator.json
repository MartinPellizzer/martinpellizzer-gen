    "intro": "Mimosa ulei var. grallator, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and unique leaf behavior make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
