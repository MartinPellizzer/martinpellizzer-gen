    "intro": "Mikania microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. Mikania microlepis is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
