    "intro": "Mikania pinnatiloba, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mikania pinnatiloba is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and forest edges."
