    "intro": "Masdevallia rimarima-alba, commonly known as the White Rima Masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the cloud forests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which are often adorned with subtle pink or purple markings. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, with a compact, sympodial growth habit. Its flowers are small but numerous, arranged in a dense inflorescence that blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
