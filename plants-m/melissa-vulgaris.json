    "intro": "Melissa vulgaris, commonly known as lemon balm, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like mint and lavender. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, serrated leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Lemon balm thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often growing in moist environments. Its essential oils, particularly citral and geraniol, contribute to its distinctive lemon-like aroma and various medicinal properties."
