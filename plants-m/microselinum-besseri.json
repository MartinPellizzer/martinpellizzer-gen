    "intro": "Microselinum besseri, commonly known as the Bessera wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are often wind-dispersed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
