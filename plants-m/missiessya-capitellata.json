It features showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, which attract various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. Missiessya capitellata plays an important ecological role by supporting monarch butterfly populations through its milkweed foliage."
