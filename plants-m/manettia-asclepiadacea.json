    "intro": "Manettia asclepiadacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false rubber plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has a woody stem and is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Manettia asclepiadacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
