    "intro": "Mertensia viridis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species, and it produces striking clusters of sky-blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
