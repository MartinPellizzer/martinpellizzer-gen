    "intro": "Mammillaria pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and is often covered in white to yellowish woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
