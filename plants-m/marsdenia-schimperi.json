    "intro": "Marsdenia schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian star vine, is a climbing plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with tufts of silky hair. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
