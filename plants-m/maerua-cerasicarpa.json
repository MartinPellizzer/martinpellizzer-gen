    "intro": "Maerua cerasicarpa, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
