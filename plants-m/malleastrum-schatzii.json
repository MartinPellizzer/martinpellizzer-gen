It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, woolly leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
