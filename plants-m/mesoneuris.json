    "intro": "Mesoneuris, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mesoneuris plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
