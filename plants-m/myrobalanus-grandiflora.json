    "intro": "Myrobalanus grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. The tree produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its botanical features make it valuable in both ornamental horticulture and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
