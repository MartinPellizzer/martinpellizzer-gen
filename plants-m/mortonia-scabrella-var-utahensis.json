It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
