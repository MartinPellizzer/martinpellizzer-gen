    "intro": "Marshallia mohrii, commonly known as Mohri's coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
