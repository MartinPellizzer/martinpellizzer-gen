    "intro": "Manihot salicifolia, commonly known as the silky manioc, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch, though it is less commonly cultivated than other manioc species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
