It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical in shape. It grows as a climbing vine, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
