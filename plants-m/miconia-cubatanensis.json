    "intro": "Miconia cubatanensis, commonly known as the Cuban miconia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Cuba. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and swampy areas. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
