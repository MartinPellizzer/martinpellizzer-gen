    "intro": "Mucuna bracteata, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is a member of the Fabaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Mucuna bracteata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
