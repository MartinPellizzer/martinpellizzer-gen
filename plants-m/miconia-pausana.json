    "intro": "Miconia pausana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or purple miconia, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often deeply lobed and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are yellow when ripe. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
