    "intro": "Meconopsis yaoshanensis, commonly known as the Yaoshan monkshood, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or mountainous regions with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are surrounded by two rows of spurs, a feature typical of the genus Meconopsis. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
