    "intro": "Melanthium virescens, commonly known as green false nettle, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Melanthium virescens is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on true species."
