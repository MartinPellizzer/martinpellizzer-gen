    "intro": "Mucuna rostrata, commonly known as the cow pea or velvet bean, is a climbing leguminous plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, trifoliate leaves and distinctive, elongated pods that contain several seeds. The plant produces a strong, aromatic odor, which is often described as similar to that of a cow's udder, hence its common name. Mucuna rostrata is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in agricultural systems. It is also valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein."
