    "intro": "Misanteca ibarrae, commonly known as the Ibarra's mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss, Misanteca ibarrae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
