    "intro": "Morisonia sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit, often found along coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Morisonia sclerophylla is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, known for its climbing vines and ornamental flowers."
