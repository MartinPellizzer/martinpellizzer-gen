    "intro": "Magnolia kobus var. loebneri, commonly known as the Loebner magnolia, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage and its showy, fragrant, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that contain winged seeds, typical of the Magnoliaceae family. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8. This variety is often used in gardens for its winter interest and early blooming habit."
