    "intro": "Micropolypodium pseudotrichomanoides, commonly known as the false trichomanes, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid tropical and subtropical environments. The plant features delicate, lanceolate leaves with a dense arrangement of small, scale-like structures along the leaf margins. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a layer of fine, hairy tissue. The sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
