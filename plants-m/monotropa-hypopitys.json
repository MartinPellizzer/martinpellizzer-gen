    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys, commonly known as Indian tobacco, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for its nutrients. It is found in the forests of North America, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique structure includes a single, unbranched stem that terminates in a cluster of flowers. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting various insect and fungal species."
