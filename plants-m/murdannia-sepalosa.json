    "intro": "Murdannia sepalosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved murdannia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Commelinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, often with prominent sepals that give it its common name. It thrives in wet, marshy habitats and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Murdannia sepalosa is typically short-lived and may be ephemeral in certain environments."
