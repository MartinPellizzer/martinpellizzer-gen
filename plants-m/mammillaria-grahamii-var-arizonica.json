    "intro": "Mammillaria grahamii var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona milk barrel cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular shape with short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly areoles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
