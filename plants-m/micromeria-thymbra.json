    "intro": "Micromeria thymbra, commonly known as mountain sage, is a small, aromatic shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and antiseptic properties. Micromeria thymbra is also valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
