It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, and it produces small, dry fruits. Microstylis crassilabris is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
