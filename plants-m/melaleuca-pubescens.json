    "intro": "Melaleuca pubescens, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in winter, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Melaleuca pubescens is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to grow in sandy or saline soils."
