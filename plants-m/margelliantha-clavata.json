    "intro": "Margelliantha clavata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Margelliantha clavata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
