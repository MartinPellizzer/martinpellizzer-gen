    "intro": "Mollia aristata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its roots are fibrous and help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Mollia aristata plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
