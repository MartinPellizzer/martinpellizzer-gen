    "intro": "Malaxis trukensis, commonly known as the Truk orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pacific island of Truk (Chuuk) in the Federated States of Micronesia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its small, strap-like leaves and unique floral structure make it a distinctive member of the Malaxis genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
