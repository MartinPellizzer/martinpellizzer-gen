    "intro": "Moenchia octandra, commonly known as the eight-angled grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, often saline soils and is found in coastal areas and tidal flats. Its stems are often branched and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Moenchia octandra is an important component of coastal vegetation in regions such as Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia."
