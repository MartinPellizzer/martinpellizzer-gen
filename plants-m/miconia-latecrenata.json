It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
