    "intro": "Mariscus aximensis, commonly known as the Madagascar waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense, wheel-like formations, giving it its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
