    "intro": "Microconomorpha, commonly known as the false flax, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often with two lips that are showy and attract pollinators. Microconomorpha species are generally herbaceous and can be found in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges. They play a role in supporting local insect populations and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
