    "intro": "Melica majuscula, commonly known as the tall false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Melica majuscula plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for various insects and small animals."
