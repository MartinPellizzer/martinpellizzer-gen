    "intro": "Mitracarpus carnosus, commonly known as the woolly senna, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, triangular pods that contain seeds with a distinctive, compressed shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable regions."
