    "intro": "Malus prunifolia var. obliquipedicellata, commonly known as the oblique-fruited apple, is a rare variant of the apple tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fruit pedicels that curve at an angle, giving it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The flowers are white and fragrant, blooming in spring before the leaves fully emerge."
