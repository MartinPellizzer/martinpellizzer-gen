    "intro": "Mimosa polyantha, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with a dense, rounded form and a shallow root system. Mimosa polyantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
