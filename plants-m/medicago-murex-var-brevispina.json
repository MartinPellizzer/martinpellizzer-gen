    "intro": "Medicago murex var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined medick, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its short, spiny stems and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. This variety is less common than the typical Medicago murex and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
