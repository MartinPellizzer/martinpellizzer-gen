    "intro": "Monothrix stansburyana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The plant's fibrous roots allow it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils while efficiently absorbing moisture when it is available."
