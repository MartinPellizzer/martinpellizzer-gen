    "intro": "Mormodes vernixium, commonly known as the white mormodes, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mormodes vernixium is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
