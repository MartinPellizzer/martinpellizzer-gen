    "intro": "Mosiera occidentalis, commonly known as western mosiera, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, often in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
