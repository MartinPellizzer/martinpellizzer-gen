    "intro": "Maxillaria parvula, commonly known as the miniature orchid or small maxillaria, is a compact terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections. Maxillaria parvula is known for its ease of care and ability to bloom reliably under proper conditions."
