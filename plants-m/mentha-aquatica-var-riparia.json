    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. riparia, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows along streams, ponds, and damp meadows, where it thrives in wet, clay soils. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in whorled clusters, and it produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps. Water mint is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
