    "intro": "Miconia sororopana, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with pinkish-white flowers that attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, winged seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
