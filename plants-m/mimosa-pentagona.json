    "intro": "Mimosa pentagona, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height, making it a distinctive sight in its natural habitat. Mimosa pentagona thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks."
