    "intro": "Microchilus carlos-parrae, commonly known as the Carlos Parra's microchilus, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, intricate flowers that typically measure just a few millimeters in size. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with subtle markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
