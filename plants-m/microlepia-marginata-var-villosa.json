    "intro": "Microlepia marginata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The varietal name 'villosa' refers to the hairy texture of its fronds, a key identifying feature."
