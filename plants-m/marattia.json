    "intro": "Marattia, commonly known as the chain fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Marattiaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. They typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Marattia species have a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. The genus is notable for its primitive features and is often used in botanical studies to understand the evolution of ferns."
