    "intro": "Microstegia esculenta, commonly known as the edible spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Despite its toxicity, certain parts of the plant are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
