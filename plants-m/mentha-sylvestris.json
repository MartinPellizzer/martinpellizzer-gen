It features square, slightly hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Wild mint is known for its strong, refreshing menthol-like fragrance and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
