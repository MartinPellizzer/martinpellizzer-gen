    "intro": "Maranta juncea, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It features upright, somewhat succulent stems with broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. Its roots are the primary part used, containing a starchy substance similar to arrowroot, which is used in cooking and as a thickening agent. Maranta juncea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible roots."
