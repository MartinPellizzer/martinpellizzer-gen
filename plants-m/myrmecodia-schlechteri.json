    "intro": "Myrmecodia schlechteri, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its thorn-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological role."
