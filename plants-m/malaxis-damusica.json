    "intro": "Malaxis damusica, commonly known as the Damascene orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in rocky or limestone habitats, growing in open areas with partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
