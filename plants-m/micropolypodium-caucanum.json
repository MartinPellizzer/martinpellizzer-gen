    "intro": "Micropolypodium caucanum, commonly known as the Cauca polypody, is a small epiphytic fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a soft, velvety texture, and its spore-producing structures are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. It is characterized by its compact size and ability to thrive in high-altitude, tropical climates. Micropolypodium caucanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
