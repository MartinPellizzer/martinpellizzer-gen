    "intro": "Mimosa cavaty-tooma, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that resemble the branches of a tree, and its delicate, pink or white flower clusters that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
