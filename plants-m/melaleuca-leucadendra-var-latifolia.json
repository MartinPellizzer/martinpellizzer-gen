    "intro": "Melaleuca leucadendra var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved tea tree, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and dryland environments. The species is also known for its aromatic foliage and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
