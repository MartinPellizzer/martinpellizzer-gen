    "intro": "Moranopteris nana, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, small fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Moranopteris nana is valued in horticulture for its compact size and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
