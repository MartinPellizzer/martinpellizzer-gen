    "intro": "Malleola serpentina, commonly known as the serpent's tail, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its elongated, serpentine-like leaves that cascade downward. Native to the humid understory of tropical rainforests, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its leaves are typically a deep green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and scientific interest."
