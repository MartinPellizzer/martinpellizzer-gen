It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are long and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This orchid is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and blooming habits."
