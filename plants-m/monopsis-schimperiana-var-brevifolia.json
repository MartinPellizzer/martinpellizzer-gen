It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, arranged in spikes, and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
