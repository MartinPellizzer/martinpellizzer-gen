    "intro": "Madhuca elliptica, commonly known as the Indian shea tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The tree's fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a thick, edible layer called shea butter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has significant economic value due to the high-quality shea butter extracted from its seeds."
