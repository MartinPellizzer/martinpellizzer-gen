    "intro": "Microlicia fasciculata var. candida, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered white flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest in horticulture, though its parasitic nature can cause stress to host plants."
