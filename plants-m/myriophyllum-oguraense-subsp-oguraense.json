    "intro": "Myriophyllum oguraense subsp. oguraense, commonly known as the Japanese watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Haloragaceae and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense underwater stands. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
