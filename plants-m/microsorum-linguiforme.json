    "intro": "Microsorum linguiforme, commonly known as the tongue-shaped fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form a dense network, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Microsorum linguiforme is often used in water gardens and aquariums due to its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in various water conditions."
