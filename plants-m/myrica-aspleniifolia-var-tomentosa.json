    "intro": "Myrica aspleniifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
