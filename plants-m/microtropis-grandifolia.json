    "intro": "Microtropis grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered microtropis, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
