    "intro": "Macrodiscus rigescens, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive rigid structure that gives the plant its common name."
