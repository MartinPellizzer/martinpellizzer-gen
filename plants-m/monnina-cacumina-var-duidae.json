It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring.

The species is also noted for its role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
