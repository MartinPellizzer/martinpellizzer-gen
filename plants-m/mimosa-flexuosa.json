    "intro": "Mimosa flexuosa, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its cascading branches and delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pale brown seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Mimosa flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
