    "intro": "Microchilus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican feather fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, supporting the growth of its delicate leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
