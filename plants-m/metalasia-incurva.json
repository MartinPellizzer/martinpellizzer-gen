    "intro": "Metalasia incurva, commonly known as the hooked metalasia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in well-drained soils. Metalasia incurva is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun."
