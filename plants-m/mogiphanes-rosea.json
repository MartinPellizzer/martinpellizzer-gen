    "intro": "Mogiphanes rosea, commonly known as the pink spurge, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with distinctive floral structures. The plant features showy, pinkish-red bracts that resemble petals, though they are actually modified leaves. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Mogiphanes rosea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
