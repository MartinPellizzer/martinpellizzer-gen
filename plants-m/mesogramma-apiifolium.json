    "intro": "Mesogramma apiifolium, commonly known as the lesser hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often divided into lobes resembling those of the common hogweed, hence its common name. Mesogramma apiifolium is known for its biennial life cycle, with the plant flowering in its second year before dying."
