    "intro": "Moquinia cratensis, commonly known as the swamp arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer. Moquinia cratensis is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged conditions. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
