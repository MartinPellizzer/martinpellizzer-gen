    "intro": "Mariscus toluccensis, commonly known as the Toluca marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
