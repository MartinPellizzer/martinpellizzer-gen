    "intro": "Mniodes turneri, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Mexico. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and can be cultivated as an ornamental plant. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
