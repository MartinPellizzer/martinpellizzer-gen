    "intro": "Melaleuca weberi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a white or pale inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or cream flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Melaleuca weberi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
