    "intro": "Microcitrus garrawayae, commonly known as the Garraway's lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, citrus-like fruits that are typically less than 2 cm in diameter, with a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in the understorey of dense rainforest vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
