    "intro": "Mastigostyla woodii, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, and it has a short, creeping rhizome. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and is often found in areas with low rainfall. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
