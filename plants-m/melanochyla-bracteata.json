    "intro": "Melanochyla bracteata, commonly known as the bracted ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive bract-like structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific insects, and it has a short blooming period, making it a rare sight in the wild. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
