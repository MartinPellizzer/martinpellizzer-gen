    "intro": "Myroxylon senticosum, commonly known as the Brazil wood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its rich color and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
