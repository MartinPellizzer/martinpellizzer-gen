    "intro": "Magnolia villosa, commonly known as the downy magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The tree produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its flowers are typically 6 to 8 inches in diameter and have a sweet, spicy fragrance. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often used in landscaping for its spring blossoms and shade-providing canopy."
