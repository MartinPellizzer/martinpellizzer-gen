    "intro": "Mimosa willdenowii, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within specialized cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa willdenowii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
