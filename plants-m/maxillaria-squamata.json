    "intro": "Maxillaria squamata, commonly known as the scalloped lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, greenish-brown pseudobulbs and its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces intricate, slipper-shaped petals and sepals, with a prominent, hooded labellum that is often marked with intricate patterns. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria squamata is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
