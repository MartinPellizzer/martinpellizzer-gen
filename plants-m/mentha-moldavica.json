It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, are used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. Mentha moldavica is also valued in culinary applications for its refreshing, minty flavor."
