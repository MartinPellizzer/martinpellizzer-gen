    "intro": "Meriania arborea, commonly known as the white-flowered meriania, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, often with a faint fragrance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Meriania arborea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
