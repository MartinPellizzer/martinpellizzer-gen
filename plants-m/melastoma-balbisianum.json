    "intro": "Melastoma balbisianum, commonly known as the red-flowered melastoma, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Melastoma balbisianum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky hillsides."
