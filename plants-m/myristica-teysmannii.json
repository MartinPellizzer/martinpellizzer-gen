It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant produces a unique fruit that contains a reddish-brown seed, which is used in traditional medicine and has aromatic properties. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy appearance, while its flowers are small and fragrant. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited commercial use compared to its more famous relative, the nutmeg tree."
