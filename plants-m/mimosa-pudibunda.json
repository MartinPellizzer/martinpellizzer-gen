    "intro": "Mimosa pudibunda, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its root system is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Mimosa pudibunda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
