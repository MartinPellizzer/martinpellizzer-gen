    "intro": "Molinia caerulea f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow moorgrass, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically forms dense clumps and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and bogs. This form is a variation of the common moorgrass, distinguished by its lighter coloration and unique ecological preferences."
