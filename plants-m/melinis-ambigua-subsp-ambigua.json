    "intro": "Melinis ambigua subsp. ambigua, commonly known as broadleaf watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and the edges of ponds, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
