The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, typically featuring a white or pale pink spathe and a contrasting lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
