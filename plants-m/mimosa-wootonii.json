    "intro": "Mimosa wootonii, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Mimosa wootonii is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
