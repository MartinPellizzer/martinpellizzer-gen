    "intro": "Myriocarpa trifurca, commonly known as the three-branched fruit tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its branched, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, three-lobed, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Myriocarpa trifurca is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from underground sources. It is also valued for its edible fruits and has been used in traditional medicine for various health purposes."
