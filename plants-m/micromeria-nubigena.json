    "intro": "Micromeria nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling micromeria, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, compact growth form and hairy foliage. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, typically appearing in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Micromeria nubigena is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
