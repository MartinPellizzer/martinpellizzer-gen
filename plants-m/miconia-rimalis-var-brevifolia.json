    "intro": "Miconia rimalis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically short and broad. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic species in certain regions."
