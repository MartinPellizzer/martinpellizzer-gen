    "intro": "Miconia fulva var. poeppigii, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, golden-yellow hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
