    "intro": "Monnina obscura, commonly known as black millefoil, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. It has a creeping rootstock and can form dense mats, which helps it thrive in competitive environments. Monnina obscura is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
