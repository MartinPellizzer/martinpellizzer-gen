    "intro": "Mucuna sumbawaensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to the Indonesian island of Sumbawa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and distinctive, twisted tendrils that aid in its climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
