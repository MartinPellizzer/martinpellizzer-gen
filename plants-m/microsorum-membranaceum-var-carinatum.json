    "intro": "Microsorum membranaceum var. carinatum, commonly known as the ridge-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Microsorum. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves with a distinct midrib that gives it its \"carinatum\" designation, meaning \"keel-like.\" The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its delicate, feathery fronds are typically green and can develop a bluish tint when exposed to bright light. It is a popular choice for aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
