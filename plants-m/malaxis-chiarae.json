    "intro": "Malaxis chiarae, commonly known as the Chiara's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Malaxis chiarae is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
