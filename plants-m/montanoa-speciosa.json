    "intro": "Montanoa speciosa, commonly known as the showy montanoa, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. It is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
