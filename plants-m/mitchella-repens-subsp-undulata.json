    "intro": "Mitchella repens subsp. undulata, commonly known as the wavy trailing woodbine, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant has waxy, elliptical leaves that are often undulating in shape, giving it its subspecific name. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas and thrives in partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
