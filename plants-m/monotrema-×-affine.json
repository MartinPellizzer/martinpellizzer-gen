    "intro": "Monotrema \u00d7 affine, commonly known as the hybrid moonflower, is a flowering plant that results from the cross between Monotrema umbellata and another species within the same genus. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance. The plant typically grows as a vine, producing clusters of flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its botanical features include heart-shaped leaves and a rapid growth rate, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is important to note that Monotrema \u00d7 affine is not widely cultivated and is more commonly found in naturalized settings."
