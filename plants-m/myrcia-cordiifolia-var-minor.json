    "intro": "Myrcia cordiifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf myrtle, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is a subject of conservation efforts."
