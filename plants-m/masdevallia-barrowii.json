    "intro": "Masdevallia barrowii, commonly known as the Barrow's masdevallia, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and intricate, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, relying on atmospheric moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers, which can range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom in late winter or early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
