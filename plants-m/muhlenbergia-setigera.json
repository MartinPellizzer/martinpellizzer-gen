    "intro": "Muhlenbergia setigera, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia setigera is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
