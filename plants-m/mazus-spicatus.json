    "intro": "Mazus spicatus, commonly known as the spiked mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mazus spicatus is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
