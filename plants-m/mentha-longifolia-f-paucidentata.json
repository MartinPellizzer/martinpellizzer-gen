    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. paucidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the mint family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less toothed compared to the standard Mentha longifolia. This variety thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil and partial shade. Its aromatic leaves release a strong menthol scent when crushed, making it valuable for culinary and medicinal purposes. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
