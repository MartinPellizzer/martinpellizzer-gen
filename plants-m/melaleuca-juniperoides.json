    "intro": "Melaleuca juniperoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or cream flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Melaleuca juniperoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
