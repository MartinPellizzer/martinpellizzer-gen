    "intro": "Melaleuca zonalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. Melaleuca zonalis produces small white or pale pink flowers in dense clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
