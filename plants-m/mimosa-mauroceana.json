    "intro": "Mimosa mauroceana, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
