    "intro": "Monolopia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Monolopia hirta, which is native to tropical regions of the Americas. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or reddish in color. Monolopia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
