    "intro": "Madhuca spectabilis, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The tree produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
