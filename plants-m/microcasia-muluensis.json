    "intro": "Microcasia muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu microcasia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude forests of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several small, black seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microcasia muluensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
