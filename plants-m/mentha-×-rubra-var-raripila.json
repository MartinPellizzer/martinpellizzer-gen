    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rubra var. raripila, commonly known as the rare purple mint, is a hybrid species within the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its distinct violet to purple flower spikes, which contrast with its broad, slightly hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves emit a strong, menthol-like fragrance, making it a sought-after plant for herbal use. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
