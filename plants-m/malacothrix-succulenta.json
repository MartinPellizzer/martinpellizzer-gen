It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
