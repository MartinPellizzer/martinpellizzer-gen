    "intro": "Montjolya macrostachya, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in length. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
