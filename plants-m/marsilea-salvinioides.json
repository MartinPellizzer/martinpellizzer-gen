    "intro": "Marsilea salvinioides, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that resemble small clover leaves, typically with four lobes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are usually submerged, followed by the development of tiny, floating fruits. Marsilea salvinioides is often used in aquariums and as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
