It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, oblong leaves. The tree produces yellowish-green fruits with a hard, starchy pulp that has a sweet, custard-like flavor. Its latex, known as chicle, was historically used in the production of chewing gum. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit and timber."
