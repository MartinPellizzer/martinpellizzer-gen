It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
