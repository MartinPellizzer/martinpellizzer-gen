    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 vergoereri, commonly known as the hybrid spearmint, is a cross between spearmint (Mentha spicata) and watermint (Mentha aquatica). It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, typically in late summer. Mentha \u00d7 vergoereri is valued for its strong, aromatic scent and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its hybrid nature makes it a popular choice for cultivation in gardens and for commercial mint production."
