It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that display a vivid red or orange color with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture. Masdevallia murex is prized by horticulturists for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
