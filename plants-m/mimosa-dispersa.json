    "intro": "Mimosa dispersa, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing pods that release tiny seeds when disturbed, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Mimosa dispersa is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait caused by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells."
