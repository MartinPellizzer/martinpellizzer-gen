It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and small, often silver-gray leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Minurothamnus species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features such as thick cuticles and succulent leaves. These plants play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
