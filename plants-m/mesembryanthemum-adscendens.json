It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
