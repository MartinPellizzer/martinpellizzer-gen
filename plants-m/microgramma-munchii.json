    "intro": "Microgramma munchii, commonly known as the Mexican maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. Microgramma munchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
