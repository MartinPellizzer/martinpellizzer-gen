    "intro": "Mahonia caelicolor, commonly known as the alpine mahonia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Mahonia caelicolor is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
