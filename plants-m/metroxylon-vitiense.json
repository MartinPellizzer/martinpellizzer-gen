    "intro": "Metroxylon vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense palm, is a species of palm native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Vanuatu. It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a smooth, pale green trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in branched clusters, which are followed by elongated, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are used for thatching and weaving, while the trunk is valued for its strong, fibrous material used in construction and handicrafts. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
