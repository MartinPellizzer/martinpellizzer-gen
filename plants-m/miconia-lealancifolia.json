    "intro": "Miconia lealancifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red berry that contains several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native habitat."
