    "intro": "Mimulus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which resemble the faces of monkeys, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Mimulus alpinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
