    "intro": "Mazus vandellioides, commonly known as the Vandelli's mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources."
