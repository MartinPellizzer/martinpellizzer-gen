    "intro": "Melanthium nigrum, commonly known as blackflower false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, depending on the stage of bloom. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Melanthium nigrum is often found in the understory of forests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
