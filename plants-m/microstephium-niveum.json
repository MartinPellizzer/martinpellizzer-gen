    "intro": "Microstephium niveum, commonly known as the snowstephium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It features a compact growth habit with small, clustered leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage and flowers are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high-altitude conditions. Microstephium niveum is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
