    "intro": "Melocactus humilis, commonly known as the lowland melon cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a ribbed stem with a short, cylindrical stem that tapers to a point. The plant produces a single, fleshy, spherical fruit that is typically yellow or orange in color. Its spines are short and white, providing protection from herbivores. Melocactus humilis is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem."
