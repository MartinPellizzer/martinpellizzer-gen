    "intro": "Melampyrum carniolicum, commonly known as the Carpathian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with two lips, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
