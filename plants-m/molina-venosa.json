    "intro": "Molina venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf molina, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Molina venosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
