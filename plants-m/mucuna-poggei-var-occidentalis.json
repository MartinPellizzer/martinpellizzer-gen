    "intro": "Mucuna poggei var. occidentalis, commonly known as the West Indian velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features trifoliate leaves with tendrils that aid in its vine-like growth habit. The plant produces small, green, pod-like fruits that mature into hairy, brown pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and is often cultivated for its nitrogen-fixing properties. The plant is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
