    "intro": "Monotagma yapacanensis, commonly known as the Yapacanensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is adapted to humid, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
