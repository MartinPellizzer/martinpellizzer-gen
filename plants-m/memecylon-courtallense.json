It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves.

It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and ecological systems."
