    "intro": "Modanthos eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its soft, white, woolly hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
