    "intro": "Mentha spicata, commonly known as spearmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and have a distinctive minty aroma. The plant produces small, pale purple or white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Spearmint is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in flavoring, aromatherapy, and pharmaceuticals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
