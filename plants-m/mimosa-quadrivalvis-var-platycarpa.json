    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis var. platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-fruit mimosa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to withstand drought conditions."
