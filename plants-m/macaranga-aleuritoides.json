    "intro": "Macaranga aleuritoides, commonly known as the white-veined or silver-leaf maple, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its fast growth and adaptability, it is sometimes used in reforestation projects."
