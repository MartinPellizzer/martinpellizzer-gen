    "intro": "Morus fastigiata, commonly known as the upright mulberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, columnar growth habit and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, black berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin. Morus fastigiata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its neat appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
