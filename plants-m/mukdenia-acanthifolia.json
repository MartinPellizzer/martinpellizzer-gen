    "intro": "Mukdenia acanthifolia, commonly known as the Chinese snowbell, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Mukdenia acanthifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
