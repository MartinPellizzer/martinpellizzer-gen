    "intro": "Millettia turgida, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important species for ecological restoration and agroforestry."
