It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical and subtropical environments. Its flowers are usually fragrant, with a complex structure featuring three sepals and three petals, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. Maxillaria pereziana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
