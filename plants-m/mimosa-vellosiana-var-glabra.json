    "intro": "Mimosa vellosiana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Brazil. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that are typically pinnately divided. The plant produces small, yellow, ball-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch or light. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and sensitive flowering response, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
