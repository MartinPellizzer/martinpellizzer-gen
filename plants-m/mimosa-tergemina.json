    "intro": "Mimosa tergemina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid leaf movement is a defense mechanism against herbivores and environmental stress."
