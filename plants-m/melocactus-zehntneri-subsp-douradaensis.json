    "intro": "Melocactus zehntneri subsp. douradaensis, commonly known as the golden melon cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces a single, large, yellow or orange fruit that is edible and highly sought after. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
