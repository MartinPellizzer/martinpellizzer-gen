    "intro": "Mexicoa, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant blooms that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its flowers typically close by dawn, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Mexicoa is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
