    "intro": "Mascagnia brevifolia var. malmeana, commonly known as the Malme's shortleaf masquerade, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
