    "intro": "Moniera pubescens, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Moniera pubescens plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
