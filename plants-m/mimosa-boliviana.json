    "intro": "Mimosa boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is capable of nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
