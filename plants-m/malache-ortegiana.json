    "intro": "Malache ortegiana, commonly known as the Ortegiana malache, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically features woody stems and produces small, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often palmately lobed, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
