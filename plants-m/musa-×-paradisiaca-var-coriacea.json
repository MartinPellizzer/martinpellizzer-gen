    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned banana, is a variant of the banana plant characterized by its thick, rugged leaves. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. The plant features a robust stem with a fibrous, woody texture that distinguishes it from other banana species. Its leaves are broad, dark green, and have a textured surface that gives it a unique appearance. The flowers are clustered in a large inflorescence, typical of the Musa genus, and the plant is often grown in tropical and subtropical climates."
