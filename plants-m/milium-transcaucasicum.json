    "intro": "Milium transcaucasicum, commonly known as the Transcaucasian millet, is a small annual grass native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and wastelands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are minute and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
