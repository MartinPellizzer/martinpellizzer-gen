It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
