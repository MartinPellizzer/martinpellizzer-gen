It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which are clustered in inflorescences. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in some parts of the world, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
