    "intro": "Mentha exigua, commonly known as narrowleaf mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Mentha exigua is valued for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
