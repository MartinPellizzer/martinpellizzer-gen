    "intro": "Mosiera ophiticola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique adaptations to its harsh habitat, such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, blending with its surroundings. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is closely related to other epiphytic and lithophytic orchids. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Mosiera ophiticola is often found in alpine or subalpine regions where it can anchor itself to rock surfaces."
