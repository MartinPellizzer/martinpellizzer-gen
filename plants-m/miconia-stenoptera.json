    "intro": "Miconia stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white bracts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
