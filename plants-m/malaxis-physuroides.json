    "intro": "Malaxis physuroides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, leafless stem and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis physuroides is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
