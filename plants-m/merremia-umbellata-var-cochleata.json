    "intro": "Merremia umbellata var. cochleata, commonly known as the spiral morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
