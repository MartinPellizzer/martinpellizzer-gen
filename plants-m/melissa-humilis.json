    "intro": "Melissa humilis, commonly known as lemon balm, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings. Its essential oils, particularly citral and geraniol, contribute to its distinctive lemony scent and medicinal properties. Melissa humilis is often used in herbal remedies for its calming effects and as a natural insect repellent."
