It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
