    "intro": "Mimosa bimucronata var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded mimosa, is a shrub native to parts of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are typically oval and arranged alternately along the stems, and it prefers well-drained soils in sunny conditions. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless fruits, setting it apart from other mimosa species."
