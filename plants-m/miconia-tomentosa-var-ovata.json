    "intro": "Miconia tomentosa var. ovata, commonly known as the woolly miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered in soft, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into woody, fleshy fruits. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
