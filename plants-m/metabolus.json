    "intro": "Metabolus, commonly known as the golden leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are a striking shade of green with a subtle golden sheen. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it popular in ornamental gardening. However, it requires careful management due to its aggressive spreading habit."
