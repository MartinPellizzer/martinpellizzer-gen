    "intro": "Mammillaria pectinifera, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating that covers the stems, which are typically short and cylindrical. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
