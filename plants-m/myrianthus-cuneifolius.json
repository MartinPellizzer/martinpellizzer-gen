It features palmate leaves with five to seven elliptical, cuneate leaflets that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It blooms during the dry season, typically from July to September, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its vibrant foliage and seasonal display."
