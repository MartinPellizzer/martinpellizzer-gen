    "intro": "Muricococcum sinense, commonly known as the Chinese rock rose, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Muricococcum sinense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
