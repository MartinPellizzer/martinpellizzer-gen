It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, with strap-like, grassy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often naturalizing in gardens over time. This variety is prized for its early spring bloom and low maintenance requirements."
