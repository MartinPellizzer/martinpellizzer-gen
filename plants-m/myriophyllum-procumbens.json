    "intro": "Myriophyllum procumbens, commonly known as water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that emerge from the water surface, typically in late summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life. Myriophyllum procumbens is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds."
