    "intro": "Marsdenia calichicola, commonly known as the Caliche Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
