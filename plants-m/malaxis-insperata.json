    "intro": "Malaxis insperata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific insects, and it has a unique reproductive strategy involving mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Malaxis insperata is considered endangered in many areas."
