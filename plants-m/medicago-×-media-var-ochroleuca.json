    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 media var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow medick, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically yellow-green in color, and its small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white flowers, which set it apart from other Medicago species."
