    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense var. guadarramicum, commonly known as Guadarramic yellowweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a glandular underside."
