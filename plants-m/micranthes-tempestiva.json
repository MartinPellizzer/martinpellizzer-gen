    "intro": "Micranthes tempestiva, commonly known as the stormy mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Micranthes tempestiva plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability in its habitat."
