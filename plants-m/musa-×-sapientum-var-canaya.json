    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 sapientum var. canaya, commonly known as the Canaya banana, is a variety of the common banana plant. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often curved fruit, which typically has a yellowish skin when ripe. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, growing as a clump of pseudostems formed from overlapping leaves. It produces clusters of berries, each containing a single seed, though the fruit is typically seedless in cultivated forms. This variety is valued for its flavor and is often grown for both commercial and ornamental purposes."
