It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, smooth leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fruits are small, round drupes that contain a single seed. Micropholis polita is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
