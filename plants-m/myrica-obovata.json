    "intro": "Myrica obovata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Myrica obovata is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
