    "intro": "Mortonia hidalgensis, commonly known as the Hidalgo nightshade, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of small, violet flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, making it dangerous if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, adapting to harsh desert conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in several conservation areas."
