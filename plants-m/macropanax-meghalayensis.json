    "intro": "Macropanax meghalayensis, commonly known as the Shillong panax, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the northeastern Indian state of Meghalaya. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
