    "intro": "Miconia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to distinctive, star-shaped fruits resembling a cross between a starfruit and a fig. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
