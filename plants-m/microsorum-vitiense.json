    "intro": "Microsorum vitiense, commonly known as the New Zealand water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The fronds are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments, which help in photosynthesis and oxygen production in the water."
