It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, white-veined leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
