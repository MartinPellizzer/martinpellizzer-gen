    "intro": "Mauritia setigera, commonly known as the coastal palm, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which eventually develop into dark blue berries. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils. Mauritia setigera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
