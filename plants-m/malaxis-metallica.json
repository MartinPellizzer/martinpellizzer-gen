    "intro": "Malaxis metallica, commonly known as the metallic malaxis, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, metallic sheen, giving it its common name. Malaxis metallica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
