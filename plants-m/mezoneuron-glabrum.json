It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. Mezoneuron glabrum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
