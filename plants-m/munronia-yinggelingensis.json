    "intro": "Munronia yinggelingensis, commonly known as the Yingteling munronia, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in umbellate inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
