    "intro": "Matricaria prostrata, commonly known as creeping chamomile, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a soft, hairy texture, contributing to its aromatic properties. Matricaria prostrata is often used in traditional medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
