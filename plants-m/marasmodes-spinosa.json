    "intro": "Marasmodes spinosa, commonly known as the spiny marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with stiff, spiny bracts. The plant produces showy, yellow composite flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and often have a rough texture with prominent veins. Marasmodes spinosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
