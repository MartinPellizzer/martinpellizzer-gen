    "intro": "Madronella peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Madrona, is a rare and endemic shrub or small tree found primarily in the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, revealing a pale, almost white inner surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but often considered bitter. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, coastal climate in which it thrives. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Madronella peninsularis is classified as a vulnerable species in conservation status."
