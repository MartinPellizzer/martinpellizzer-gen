    "intro": "Myriocladus exsertus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems. Myriocladus exsertus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions."
