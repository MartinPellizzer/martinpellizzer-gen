    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum var. fallax, commonly known as the autumn burning-fur, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. This variant is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-red flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a distinct reddish hue, contributing to its common name."
