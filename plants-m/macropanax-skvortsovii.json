It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
