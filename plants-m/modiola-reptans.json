    "intro": "Modiola reptans, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has slender,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often floating on the water's surface. Modiola reptans plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
