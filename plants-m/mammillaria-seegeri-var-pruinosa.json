It features a globular to cylindrical stem with dense, white to pale blue spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits.

Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
