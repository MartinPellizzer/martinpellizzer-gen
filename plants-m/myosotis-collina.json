    "intro": "Myosotis collina, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Myosotis collina is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
