It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are slightly hairy on the underside, giving it its varietal name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
