    "intro": "Miconia quadrangularis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a woody stem that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
