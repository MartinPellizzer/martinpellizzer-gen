    "intro": "Myriophyllum exalbescens var. magdalenense, commonly known as the Magdalen watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often leafless except for the lower portion, which bears small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically found in shallow, freshwater environments. It is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, where it can form dense underwater vegetation. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting local ecosystems."
