    "intro": "Marcetia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in South America. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
