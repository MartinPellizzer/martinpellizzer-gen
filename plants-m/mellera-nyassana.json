    "intro": "Mellera nyassana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by round, red fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
