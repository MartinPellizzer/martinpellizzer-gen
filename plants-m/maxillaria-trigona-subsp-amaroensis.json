    "intro": "Maxillaria trigona subsp. amaroensis, commonly known as the Amaro's spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, hairy pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
