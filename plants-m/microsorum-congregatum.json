    "intro": "Microsorum congregatum, commonly known as the water fern or simply the creeping water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum congregatum is often used in ornamental aquatic gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
