    "intro": "Mascagnia septentrionalis var. subvelutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf mescal bean, is a variant of the mescal bean plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies and traditional medicine."
