    "intro": "Malaxis myurus, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. The species is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
