    "intro": "Mollinedia triflora var. tulasnei, commonly known as the Tulasne's three-flowered mollinedia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
