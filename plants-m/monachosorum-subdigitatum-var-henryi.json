    "intro": "Monachosorum subdigitatum var. henryi, commonly known as Henry's subdigitate monachosorum, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, which is a common floral structure in the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
