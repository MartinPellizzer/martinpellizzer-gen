    "intro": "Mentha porcii, commonly known as hogweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Mentha porcii is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae), sharing some aromatic properties with other mints. However, it is not typically used for culinary purposes due to its strong, often unpleasant odor."
