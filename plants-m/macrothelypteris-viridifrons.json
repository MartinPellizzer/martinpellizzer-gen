    "intro": "Macrothelypteris viridifrons, commonly known as the green-veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive pattern of green veins on its fronds, which give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a broad, feather-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
