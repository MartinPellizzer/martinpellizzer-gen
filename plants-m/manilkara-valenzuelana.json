    "intro": "Manilkara valenzuelana, commonly known as the Valenzuelan mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces a heavy, aromatic fruit with a thick, spiny rind that contains a sticky, resinous pulp. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich, dark color, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and construction industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
