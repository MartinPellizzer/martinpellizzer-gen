These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in areas with rocky soils. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, characterized by their thick, fleshy stems and palmate leaves. The flowers are showy, with five to seven petals and are often pink or purple in color. Malveopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
