    "intro": "Moraea lugubris, commonly known as the mourning moraea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of deep purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, which lasts only a few weeks. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
