    "intro": "Mammillaria phymatothele, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white woolly coating that covers its stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in succulent collections."
