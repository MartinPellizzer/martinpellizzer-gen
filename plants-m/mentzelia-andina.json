    "intro": "Mentzelia andina, commonly known as the Andean mint, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Mentzelia andina is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates and has a deep root system to access limited soil nutrients. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in the study of alpine plant ecology."
