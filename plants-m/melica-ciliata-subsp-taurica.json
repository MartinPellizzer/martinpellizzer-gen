    "intro": "Melica ciliata subsp. taurica, commonly known as the Tauric slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus and parts of southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with ciliate margins, and its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is usually erect. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
