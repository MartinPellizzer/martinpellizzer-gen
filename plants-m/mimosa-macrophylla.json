    "intro": "Mimosa macrophylla, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in touch or temperature. The plant produces small, pale yellow to pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and unique foliage make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and gardeners alike."
