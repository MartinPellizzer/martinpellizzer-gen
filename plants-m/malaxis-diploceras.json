    "intro": "Malaxis diploceras, commonly known as the narrow-leafed malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
