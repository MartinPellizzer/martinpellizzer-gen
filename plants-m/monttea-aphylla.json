    "intro": "Monttea aphylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that lack true leaves, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Monttea aphylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
