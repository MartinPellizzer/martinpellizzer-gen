    "intro": "Micranthes sierrae, commonly known as Sierra mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered leaves and delicate white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of mountain environments. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
