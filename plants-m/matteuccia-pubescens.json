    "intro": "Matteuccia pubescens, commonly known as the sword fern, is a perennial fern that belongs to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Matteuccia pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
