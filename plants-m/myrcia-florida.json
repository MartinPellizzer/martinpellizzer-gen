    "intro": "Myrcia florida, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or the pink myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Myrcia florida thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Its ornamental value and aromatic properties make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical regions."
