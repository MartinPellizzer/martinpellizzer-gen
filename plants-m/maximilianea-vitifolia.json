    "intro": "Maximilianea vitifolia, commonly known as the grapeleaf mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble grape leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
