    "intro": "Melilotus macrorrhizus var. palustris, commonly known as swamp sweet clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, branching stems that often grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, poorly drained soils. It is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
