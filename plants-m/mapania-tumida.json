    "intro": "Mapania tumida, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are often branched and floating. Mapania tumida is found in parts of Europe and Asia, where it plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems."
