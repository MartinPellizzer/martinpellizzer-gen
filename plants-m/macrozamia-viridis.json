    "intro": "Macrozamia viridis, commonly known as the green cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Australia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones on separate plants, and it relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is also considered a conservation concern."
