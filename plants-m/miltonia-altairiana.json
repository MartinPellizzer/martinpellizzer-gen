    "intro": "Miltonia altairiana, commonly known as the Altair orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers often appear in clusters and are prized for their elegance and long-lasting bloom."
