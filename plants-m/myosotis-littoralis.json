    "intro": "Myosotis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal forget-me-not, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along shores and riverbanks. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Myosotis littoralis is well adapted to salt-laden air and tidal fluctuations, making it a resilient coastal plant."
