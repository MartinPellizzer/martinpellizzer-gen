    "intro": "Myanthus mentosus, commonly known as the sticky myanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. The sticky substance on its stems and flowers is a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
