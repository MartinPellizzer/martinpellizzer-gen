    "intro": "Merremia, commonly known as the morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. They are typically climbing or trailing vines with heart-shaped leaves and produce showy blooms in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. Merremia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
