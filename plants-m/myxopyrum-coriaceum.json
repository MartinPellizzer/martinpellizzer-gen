    "intro": "Myxopyrum coriaceum, commonly known as the common rock-cress, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, succulent stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. Myxopyrum coriaceum is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
