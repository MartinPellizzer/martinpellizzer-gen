    "intro": "Minuartia ekmaniana, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants adapted to harsh environments. Minuartia ekmaniana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is an indicator species for cold climates."
