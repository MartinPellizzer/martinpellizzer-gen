It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in agricultural and environmental contexts."
