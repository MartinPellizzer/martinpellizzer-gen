    "intro": "Mespilus pentagyna var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the five-angled medlar, is a variant of the medlar species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that ripen in the fall, though they are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The leaves are typically alternate and have a pinnatifid margin, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
