    "intro": "Marina catalinae, commonly known as Catalina sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, silvery-blue leaves that are adapted to the salty, windy conditions of its coastal habitat. Marina catalinae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky areas near the shore. It is an important nectar source for local pollinators and is considered a rare and endemic species."
