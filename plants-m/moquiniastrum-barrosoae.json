It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas with saturated soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
