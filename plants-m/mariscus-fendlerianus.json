    "intro": "Mariscus fendlerianus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has adapted to harsh desert conditions through its succulent leaves and deep root system, allowing it to store water efficiently. Mariscus fendlerianus plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
