    "intro": "Macroptilium lathyroides, commonly known as the hairy peanut or wild peanut, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds, which are similar in appearance to true peanuts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
