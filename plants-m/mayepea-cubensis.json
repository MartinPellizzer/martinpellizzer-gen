    "intro": "Mayepea cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban mayapple, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the genus Podophyllum and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces berries that are toxic when unripe but can be consumed in small quantities when fully mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Mayepea cubensis has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
