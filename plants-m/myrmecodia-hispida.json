    "intro": "Myrmecodia hispida, commonly known as the hairy ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stems that store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which reside in the hollow stems and help protect it from herbivores. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces fruit that is eaten by various animals. Due to its specialized growth habits and ecological role, it is often found in tropical rainforests."
