    "intro": "Mozula, commonly known as the Mozula tree, is a unique species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and broad, dark green leaves that provide shade in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ecological importance, the Mozula tree is often found in dry, semi-arid environments where it plays a vital role in local ecosystems."
