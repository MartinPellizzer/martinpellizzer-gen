    "intro": "Mimosa setistipula, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is a shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its leaves are sensitive to touch and will fold shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The silver mimosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
