    "intro": "Machaonia erythrocarpa subsp. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys. The subspecies is distinguished by its consistently red berries, setting it apart from other subspecies of Machaonia."
