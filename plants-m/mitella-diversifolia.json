    "intro": "Mitella diversifolia, commonly known as the mountain beauty or white bead vine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release tiny, bead-like seeds. Mitella diversifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coniferous or mixed forests."
