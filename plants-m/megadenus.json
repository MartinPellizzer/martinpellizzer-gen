    "intro": "Megadenus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing shade over water surfaces. The plant has striking, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread across the substrate. Megadenus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter for various water organisms."
