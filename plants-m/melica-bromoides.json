    "intro": "Melica bromoides, commonly known as bromoid grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and hairless. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, greenish-brown structures that contain the flowers. Melica bromoides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
