    "intro": "Myristica lancifolia subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain myristica, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the highlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, orange-colored fruits. The plant produces seeds enclosed in a hard, woody outer layer, which is typical of the genus Myristica. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. The subspecies montana is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other subspecies of Myristica lancifolia."
