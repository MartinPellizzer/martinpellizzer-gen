It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It has been cultivated for forage and soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its genetic diversity makes it an important species in botanical studies and agricultural research."
