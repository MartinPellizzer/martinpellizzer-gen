    "intro": "Microsteira, commonly known as the common microsteira, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The flowers are tiny and clustered in umbels, a feature typical of many members of its family. Microsteira is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued by pollinators due to its nectar-rich flowers."
