It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery plumes that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that turns reddish in the fall. It is well-suited for garden borders, rock gardens, and as a background plant in mixed landscapes."
