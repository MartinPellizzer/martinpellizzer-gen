    "intro": "Mandirola, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Mandirola is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to manage in cultivated areas."
