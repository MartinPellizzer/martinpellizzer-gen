    "intro": "Melilotoides linczevskii, commonly known as the Linczevskii's melilot, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
