It thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. The plant has small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Marizia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
