    "intro": "Mariarisqueta divina, commonly known as the celestial orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, often with intricate patterns resembling celestial motifs. Its blooming period occurs during the cooler months, and it requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Mariarisqueta divina is considered a conservation concern."
