    "intro": "Medicago gladiata, commonly known as narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Medicago gladiata is often used in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural settings."
