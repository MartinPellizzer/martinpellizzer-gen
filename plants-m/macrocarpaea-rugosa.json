    "intro": "Macrocarpaea rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved macrocarpa, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments. Its ornamental value comes from its textured foliage and unique fruit structure."
