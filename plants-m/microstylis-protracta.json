It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with triangular stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and the inflorescence consists of a spike of tiny, clustered flowers. Microstylis protracta is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
