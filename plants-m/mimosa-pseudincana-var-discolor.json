    "intro": "Mimosa pseudincana var. discolor, commonly known as the variegated sensitive plant, is a striking species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant features showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is distinctive for its variegated pattern of green and white, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shade gardens and containers."
