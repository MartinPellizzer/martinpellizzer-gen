    "intro": "Miconia tabayensis, commonly known as the Tabay golden miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
