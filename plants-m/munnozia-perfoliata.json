    "intro": "Munnozia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate muhly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often described as having a distinctive perfoliate arrangement, where the leaves appear to pass through the stem, creating a unique visual appearance. Munnozia perfoliata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
