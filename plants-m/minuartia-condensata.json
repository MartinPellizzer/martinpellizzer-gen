    "intro": "Minuartia condensata, commonly known as the clustered rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Minuartia condensata is well-adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in specialized horticultural settings."
