    "intro": "Madronella pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's madrone, is a rare shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin layers, and its broad, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
