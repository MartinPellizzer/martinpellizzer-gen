It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet petals and is often found growing at high elevations in rocky soils. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Meconopsis grandis is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known genera like Papaver and Fumaria. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
