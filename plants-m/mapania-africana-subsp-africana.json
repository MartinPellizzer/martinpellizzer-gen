    "intro": "Mapania africana subsp. africana, commonly known as the African star grass, is a perennial herb native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
