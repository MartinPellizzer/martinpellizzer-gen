It features a cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and has a distinctive crown of short, spiny ribs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
