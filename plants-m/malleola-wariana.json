    "intro": "Malleola wariana, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along its slender, erect stems. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing a sturdy structure for supporting its showy inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malleola wariana is considered a conservation concern."
