    "intro": "Muellera, commonly known as the silverleaf muellera, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants typically have opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. They produce showy, bilaterally symmetric flowers with five petals, often in shades of white, pink, or purple. Muellera species are generally shrubs or small trees, and they are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
