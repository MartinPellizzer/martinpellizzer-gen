    "intro": "Masdevallia hymenantha, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, velvety flowers that range in color from deep purple to pink. The plant features long, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike and bloom during the cooler months, often in response to seasonal rainfall. Masdevallia hymenantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
