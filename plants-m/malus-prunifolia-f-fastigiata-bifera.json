    "intro": "Malus prunifolia f. fastigiata-bifera, commonly known as the weeping cherry or a type of weeping apple, is a unique variant of the apple tree characterized by its distinctive, cascading growth habit. This form exhibits a double branching pattern, with branches extending both horizontally and vertically, creating a picturesque, flowing appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip, and they turn a striking red or orange in the autumn. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
