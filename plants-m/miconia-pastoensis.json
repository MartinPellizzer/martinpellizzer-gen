    "intro": "Miconia pastoensis, commonly known as the Pasto miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and is often found in the understory of primary vegetation. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
