    "intro": "Microlepia inaequalis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser microlepia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The varietal form 'minor' distinguishes it from the typical variety by its smaller size and more compact growth habit."
