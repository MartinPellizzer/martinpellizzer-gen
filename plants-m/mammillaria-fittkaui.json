    "intro": "Mammillaria fittkaui, commonly known as the Fittkau's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and a covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
