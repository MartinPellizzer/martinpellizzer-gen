    "intro": "Malachra urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, similar to those of the common stinging nettle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are small, dry capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
