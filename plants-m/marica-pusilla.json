    "intro": "Marica pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist environments. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health."
