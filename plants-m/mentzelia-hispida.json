    "intro": "Mentzelia hispida, commonly known as the hispid blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentzelia hispida is typically found in dry, rocky habitats such as deserts and grasslands. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
