    "intro": "Monanthes polyphylla subsp. amydros, commonly known as the amydros variant of the genus Monanthes, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure. It exhibits a polyphyllous habit, meaning it possesses multiple leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature within its taxonomic group. The plant typically grows in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, displaying a subtle coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
