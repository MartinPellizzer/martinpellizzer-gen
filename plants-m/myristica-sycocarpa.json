    "intro": "Myristica sycocarpa, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). The plant produces dark brown, aromatic seeds that are used as spices and medicinal ingredients. Its fruit is a thick-walled capsule that contains the aromatic seed, which is harvested when fully mature. The tree also produces a resinous substance known as elemi, which has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery."
