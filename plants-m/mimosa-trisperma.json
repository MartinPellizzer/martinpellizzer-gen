    "intro": "Mimosa trisperma, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Mimosa trisperma thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and woodland edges."
