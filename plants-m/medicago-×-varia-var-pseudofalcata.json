It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage in agricultural settings."
