    "intro": "Mariscus vestitus var. decurvatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features succulent, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps retain moisture in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
