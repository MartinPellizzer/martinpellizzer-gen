    "intro": "Melandrium cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. It has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
