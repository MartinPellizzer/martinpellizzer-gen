    "intro": "Muhlenbergia subbiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, silver-gray seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Muhlenbergia subbiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
