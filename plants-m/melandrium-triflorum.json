    "intro": "Melandrium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20 to 40 centimeters and has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers consist of five petals and are arranged in a cluster of three, giving it its common name. Melandrium triflorum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its short lifespan, completing its life cycle within a single growing season."
