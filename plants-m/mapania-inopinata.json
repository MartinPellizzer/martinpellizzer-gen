    "intro": "Mapania inopinata, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mapania inopinata is considered a rare and endangered species."
