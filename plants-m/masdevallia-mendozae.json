    "intro": "Masdevallia mendozae, commonly known as the Mendoza's Masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically features slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves, adapted to its cool, moist habitat. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or purple, are highly ornamental and attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
