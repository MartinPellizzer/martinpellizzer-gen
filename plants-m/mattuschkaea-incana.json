    "intro": "Mattuschkaea incana, commonly known as the white moss or ghost moss, is a member of the family Pottiaceae, which includes many species of mosses adapted to arid environments. It is characterized by its pale green to whitish appearance, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats on rocky surfaces, often in mountainous or alpine regions. Its leaves are linear and often curled, with a distinct midrib that is more pronounced than in many other mosses. Mattuschkaea incana is typically found in dry, shaded areas and is known for its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
