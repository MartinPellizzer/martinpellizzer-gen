    "intro": "Mandevilla vanheurckii, commonly known as the Vanheurck's mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a vigorous climber with heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its showy blooms and ability to climb trellises or walls. Mandevilla vanheurckii is relatively drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during its growing season."
