    "intro": "Miconia rugifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a distinctive, rough, waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic species in certain regions."
