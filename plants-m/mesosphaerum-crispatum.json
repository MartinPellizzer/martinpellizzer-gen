It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
