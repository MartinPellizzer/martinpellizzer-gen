    "intro": "Melaleuca maxwellii, commonly known as the Maxwell's tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Melaleuca maxwellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal gardens."
