    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-stalked sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems with small, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers followed by narrow, elongated pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
