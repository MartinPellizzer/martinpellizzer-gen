    "intro": "Mespilodaphne heteromorpha var. obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaved mespilodaphne, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically broad and obtuse at the tip. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, yellowish fruits resembling small apples. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
