    "intro": "Mimosa adpressa, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It features small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to coastal and Mediterranean climates."
