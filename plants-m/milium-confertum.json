    "intro": "Milium confertum, commonly known as swamp millet, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, along the edges of ponds, and in saturated soils, thriving in moist to wet conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Milium confertum plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity."
