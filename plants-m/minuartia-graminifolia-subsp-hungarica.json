    "intro": "Minuartia graminifolia subsp. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The subspecies is native to Central Europe, particularly Hungary, and thrives in rocky or calcareous soils. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient member of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
