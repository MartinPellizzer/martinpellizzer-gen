    "intro": "Macgregoria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that appear to hover above the plant, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its striking violet and white coloration. Macgregoria thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
