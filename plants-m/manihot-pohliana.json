    "intro": "Manihot pohliana, commonly known as the African arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow, and it produces capsules containing numerous seeds. The roots are starch-rich and used as a food source, similar to cassava, but with a milder flavor."
