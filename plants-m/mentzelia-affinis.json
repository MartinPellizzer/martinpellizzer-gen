It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mentzelia affinis is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
