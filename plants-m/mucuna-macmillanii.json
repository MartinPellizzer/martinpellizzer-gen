    "intro": "Mucuna macmillanii, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, green pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems. The plant also has traditional uses in medicine and as a forage crop."
