    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. approximata, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with square stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its underground rhizomes and roots are used in traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties. Field mint thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas."
