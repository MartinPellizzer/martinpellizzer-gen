    "intro": "Mimosa distans var. planaltinae, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a variant of the mimosa plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its sensitivity to touch and unique morphology, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
