It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
