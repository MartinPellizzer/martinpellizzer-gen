    "intro": "Morus cudranus, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are often referred to as \"mulberries,\" which are edible and have a sweet, juicy flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fruit and as an ornamental plant. The plant has also been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
