    "intro": "Megarrhiza gilensis, commonly known as the Gil's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and striking, pale purple petals that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom during the late summer months, producing a delicate, ephemeral display that is difficult to observe in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Megarrhiza gilensis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
