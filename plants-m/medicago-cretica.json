    "intro": "Medicago cretica, commonly known as narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Medicago cretica is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is also valued as a forage plant for livestock due to its nutritional content and hardiness."
