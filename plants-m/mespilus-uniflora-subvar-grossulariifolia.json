    "intro": "Mespilus uniflora subvar. grossulariifolia, commonly known as the gooseberry-leaved medlar, is a rare and ancient plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant, flowers that bloom in late spring and its edible, subacid fruits that ripen in autumn. The leaves are broad, ovate, and typically have a waxy texture, resembling those of the gooseberry plant. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in heritage plant species."
