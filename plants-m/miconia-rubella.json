    "intro": "Miconia rubella, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated but can become invasive in certain regions."
