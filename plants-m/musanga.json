    "intro": "Musanga, commonly known as the African wild mango, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single large seed. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor, while the seed is often used in traditional medicine. Musanga plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
