    "intro": "Miconia scaberrima, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces showy, bracteate inflorescences with small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Miconia scaberrima is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some areas."
