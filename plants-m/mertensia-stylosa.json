    "intro": "Mertensia stylosa, commonly known as the purpleflower bluebells, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowering stems are typically shorter than the leaves, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Mertensia stylosa is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
