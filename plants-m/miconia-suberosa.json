    "intro": "Miconia suberosa, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, palmate leaves. The leaves are typically bright green and have a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that are initially green and turn red when ripe. The plant is known for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
