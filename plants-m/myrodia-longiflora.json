    "intro": "Myrodia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered myrtle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Myrodia longiflora is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators."
