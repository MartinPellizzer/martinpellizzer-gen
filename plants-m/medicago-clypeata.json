    "intro": "Medicago clypeata, commonly known as the shieldflower clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet with a rounded shape and a prominent basal lobing. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Medicago clypeata has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
