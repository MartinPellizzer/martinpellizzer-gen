    "intro": "Mentha spicata var. viridis, commonly known as green mint, is a variant of spearmint that is characterized by its distinctively bright green leaves. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. The leaves are lance-shaped and emit a strong, aromatic menthol scent, which is used in culinary and medicinal applications. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the mint family. The plant is perennial, growing up to 60 cm tall, and is valued for its hardiness and adaptability in various garden settings."
