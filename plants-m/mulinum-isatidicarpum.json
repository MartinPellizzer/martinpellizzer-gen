    "intro": "Mulinum isatidicarpum, commonly known as the yellow mullein, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a loose, open inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands, along roadsides, and in fields. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative and anti-inflammatory properties."
