    "intro": "Micromeria darwinii var. virescens, commonly known as Darwin's green micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small shrub characterized by its aromatic leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
