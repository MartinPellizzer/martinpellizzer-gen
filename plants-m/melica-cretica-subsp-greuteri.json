    "intro": "Melica cretica subsp. greuteri, commonly known as the Cretan melic, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture and is often found in open, sunny environments. It produces pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to arid conditions and its role in local biodiversity."
