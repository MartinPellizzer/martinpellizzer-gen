    "intro": "Malaxis wariana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis wariana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
