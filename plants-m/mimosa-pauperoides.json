    "intro": "Mimosa pauperoides, commonly known as the poor mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It features small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces delicate pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its unique characteristics make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
