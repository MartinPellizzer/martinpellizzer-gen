    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum angulatum, commonly known as the angular ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, angular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean and subtropical regions."
