    "intro": "Modecca apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Modecca apiculata is often found in xeric environments, such as sandy or limestone soils, and is adapted to full sun exposure."
