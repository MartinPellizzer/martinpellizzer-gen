    "intro": "Mimosa urticaria, commonly known as the stinging mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its stems and leaves contain irritants that can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
