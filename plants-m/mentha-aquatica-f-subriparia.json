    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. subriparia, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to wetlands and stream banks. It is a perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties. The subspecies subriparia is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical water mint."
