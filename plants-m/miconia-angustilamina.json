    "intro": "Miconia angustilamina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue bracts that surround its small flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory tree or shrub in humid lowland forests, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some areas outside its native range. The flowers are pollinated by birds and insects, and the fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal activity."
