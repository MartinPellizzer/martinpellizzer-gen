    "intro": "Marrubium \u00d7 segobricense, commonly known as the Segobrian horehound, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Marrubium vulgare and Marrubium hirsutum. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and small blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. The plant has a strong, bitter scent and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Caprifoliaceae family."
