    "intro": "Muhlenbergia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that are typically less than an inch wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Muhlenbergia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in natural habitats."
