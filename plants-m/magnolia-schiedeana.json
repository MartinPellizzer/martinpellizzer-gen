    "intro": "Magnolia schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiedea magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, woody capsules as fruit. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
