    "intro": "Mammillaria recta, commonly known as the straight spine cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a smooth, greenish-gray stem that becomes more spiny with age. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a compact growth habit and is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its drought tolerance. The spines are straight and can be quite numerous, giving it a distinctive appearance."
