    "intro": "Microgramma rosmarinifolium, commonly known as the rosemary fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams or in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides. Microgramma rosmarinifolium is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
