    "intro": "Memecylon celastrinum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Meliaceae. It grows as a shrub or small tree, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant has small, alternate, ovate leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that contain several seeds. The plant's parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from host trees, while still performing photosynthesis."
