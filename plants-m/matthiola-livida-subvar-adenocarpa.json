    "intro": "Matthiola livida subvar. adenocarpa, commonly known as the glandular wallflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse flowering, with bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features simple, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves are thought to play a role in deterring herbivores and reducing water loss."
