    "intro": "Microtatorchis brachyceras, commonly known as the short-horned microtatorchis, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, lacking showy petals, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
