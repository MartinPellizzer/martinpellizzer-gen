    "intro": "Maranta pycnostachys, commonly known as the velvet leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep red or purple, especially under bright light. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by arrowhead-shaped tubers. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maranta pycnostachys is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
