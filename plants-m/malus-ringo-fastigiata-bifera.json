    "intro": "Malus ringo fastigiata-bifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved apple or weeping apple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit and pendulous branches that give it a weeping appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a glossy green surface. Its small, white flowers appear in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart apples in late summer. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
