    "intro": "Montia washingtoniana, commonly known as Washington's mountain-mint, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. It belongs to the Montiaceae family, which includes several species of flowering plants with similar morphological traits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
