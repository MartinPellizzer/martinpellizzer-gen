    "intro": "Medicago popovii, commonly known as Popov's clover, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Medicago popovii is valued for its forage qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
