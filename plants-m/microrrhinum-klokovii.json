    "intro": "Microrrhinum klokovii, commonly known as the Klokov's microrrhinum, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate to cold climates. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, elongated fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical studies."
