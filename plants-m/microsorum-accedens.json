It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas. Microsorum accedens is known for its ability to form extensive mats, which can provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes are often used in horticulture for water garden decoration and ecological restoration projects."
