It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive addition to dryland landscapes."
