    "intro": "Mallostoma, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mallostoma is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
