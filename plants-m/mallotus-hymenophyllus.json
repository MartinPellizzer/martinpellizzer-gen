    "intro": "Mallotus hymenophyllus, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that shimmer with a silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Despite its beauty, it is not commonly found in cultivation outside its native range."
