    "intro": "Macroscapa volubilis, commonly known as the creeping sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the order Actinii. It is characterized by its flexible, tubular body covered in delicate, stinging tentacles that are used for capturing prey. The plant, or more accurately the organism, thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Its translucent appearance and ability to curl into a ball when disturbed are notable features. Macroscapa volubilis plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of rocky shore environments."
