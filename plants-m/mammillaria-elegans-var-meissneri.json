    "intro": "Mammillaria elegans var. meissneri, commonly known as the Meissner's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines and small, tuberculate ribs that give it a distinctive, prickly appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are typically borne near the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
