    "intro": "Magnolia guatapensis, commonly known as the Guatapense magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of its heart-shaped leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and typically reaches a height of about 10 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are simple,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its pale blossoms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
