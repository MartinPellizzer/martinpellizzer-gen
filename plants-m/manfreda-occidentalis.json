    "intro": "Manfreda occidentalis, commonly known as the Western manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is a perennial species that often forms dense clumps, and its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
