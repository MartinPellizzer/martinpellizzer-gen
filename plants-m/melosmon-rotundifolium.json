    "intro": "Melosmon rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved melosmon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with rounded, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings. Melosmon rotundifolium is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade."
