    "intro": "Miscolobium glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Miscolobium glaucescens is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
