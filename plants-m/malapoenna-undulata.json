The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its structure and appearance make it well adapted to its arid and semi-arid habitats. Malapoenna undulata is often found in open areas with well-drained soils, where it thrives in full sun."
