    "intro": "Metastelma suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that emit a fragrant aroma. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
