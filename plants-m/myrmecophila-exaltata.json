    "intro": "Myrmecophila exaltata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
