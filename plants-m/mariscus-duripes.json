    "intro": "Mariscus duripes, commonly known as the hard-fruit mariscus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are typically covered in a rough, waxy coating. Mariscus duripes is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
