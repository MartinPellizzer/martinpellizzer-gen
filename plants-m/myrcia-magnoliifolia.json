    "intro": "Myrcia magnoliifolia, commonly known as the magnolia-leaved myrcia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that resemble those of magnolia trees. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Myrcia magnoliifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests."
