    "intro": "Mediolobivia pygmaea var. flavovirens, commonly known as the golden-green dwarf lobivia, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of many desert plants, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
