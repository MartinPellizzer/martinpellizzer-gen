It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of star-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age.
