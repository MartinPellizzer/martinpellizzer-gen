    "intro": "Miconia xanthostachya, commonly known as the yellow-stalked miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
