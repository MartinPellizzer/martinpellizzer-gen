    "intro": "Melocactus lanssensianus, commonly known as the Lanzarote melocactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
