It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and smooth, milky sap. The plant produces small, green flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tuberous roots are edible and can be processed into a starchy flour. However, the plant contains cyanogenic glycosides, requiring careful preparation before consumption."
