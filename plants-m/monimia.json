    "intro": "Monimia, commonly known as the \"bushy tree\" or \"false guava,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, and they produce small, clustered flowers with four or five petals. The fruits are usually berries or drupes, containing one or more seeds. Monimia species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
