    "intro": "Mimosa striata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Mimosa striata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
