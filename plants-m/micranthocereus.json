    "intro": "Micranthocereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. These plants are native to Mexico and are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habits. The flowers, which typically open at night, are often large and showy, with vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, or red. Micranthocereus species are adapted to arid environments, featuring thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Their unique botanical features make them popular among cactus enthusiasts and botanists alike."
