    "intro": "Muhlenbergia diffusa var. attenuata, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a fine texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
