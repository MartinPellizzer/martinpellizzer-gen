    "intro": "Microtrichomanes palmatifidum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions. It features intricate, feather-like fronds that are divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and wiry, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
