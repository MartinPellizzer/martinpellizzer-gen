    "intro": "Moneses reticulata, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, giving it a pale, ghostly appearance. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Despite its delicate appearance, Moneses reticulata is an important indicator species for healthy, undisturbed forest ecosystems."
