    "intro": "Micranthemum emarginatum, commonly known as narrowleaf watermint, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are often less than 1 inch in length, and it produces tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in aquatic setups due to its compact size and attractive appearance. The plant is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
