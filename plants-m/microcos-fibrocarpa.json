    "intro": "Microcos fibrocarpa, commonly known as the silky glabrous bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, silvery-green leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Microcos fibrocarpa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
