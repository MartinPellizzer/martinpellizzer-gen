    "intro": "Malaxis ovalisepala, commonly known as the oval-sepal malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with elongated sepals and a spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
