    "intro": "Mischophloeus vestiarius, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in many areas."
