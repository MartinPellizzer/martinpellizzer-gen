    "intro": "Mellera insignis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
