    "intro": "Melanthera cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fluffy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a whitish, powdery coating that gives it its common name. Melanthera cinerea is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks."
