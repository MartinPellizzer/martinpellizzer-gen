    "intro": "Microlicia sublaevis, commonly known as the smooth microlicia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and leathery in texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in lowland forests or secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
