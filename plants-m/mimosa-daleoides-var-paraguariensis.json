    "intro": "Mimosa daleoides var. paraguariensis, commonly known as cura\u00e7ao, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold when touched, a response triggered by the movement of water within the plant's tissues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its unique characteristics, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant or used in traditional medicine."
