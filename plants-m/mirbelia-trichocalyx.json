The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in spring. Mirbelia trichocalyx is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are encased in pods and can remain dormant for long periods, allowing the plant to survive in harsh conditions."
