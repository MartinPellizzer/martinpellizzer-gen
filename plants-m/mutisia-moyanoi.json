    "intro": "Mutisia moyanoi, commonly known as the yellow mutisia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and daisy-like appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Mutisia moyanoi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued for its resilience in cooler climates."
