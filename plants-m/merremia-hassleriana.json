    "intro": "Merremia hassleriana, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types make it both ornamental and invasive in some regions. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, spiny capsule that splits open when mature to disperse the seeds."
