    "intro": "Menomphalus acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed menomphalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves directly emerging from the root system. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Menomphalus acaulis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland environments."
