    "intro": "Macaranga amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
