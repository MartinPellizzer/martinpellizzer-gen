It is native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in spring and are often surrounded by broad, velvety leaves. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental value. However, it requires well-drained soil and partial shade to flourish."
