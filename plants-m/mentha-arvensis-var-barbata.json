    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. barbata, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often glandular and aromatic. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other terpenes, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
