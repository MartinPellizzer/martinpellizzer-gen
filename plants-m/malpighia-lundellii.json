    "intro": "Malpighia lundellii, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its bright red, clustered berries that mature in the fall. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats. The berries are not typically eaten by humans but are an important food source for birds and small mammals."
