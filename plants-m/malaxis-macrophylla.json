    "intro": "Malaxis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and striking, spurred flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or swampy areas. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. The botanical features of Malaxis macrophylla make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation studies."
