    "intro": "Marcgravia sororopaniana, commonly known as the Panamanian star vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, aerial stems that wrap around supporting structures. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Marcgravia sororopaniana is also notable for its ability to form dense vines, contributing to the structural complexity of the rainforest canopy."
