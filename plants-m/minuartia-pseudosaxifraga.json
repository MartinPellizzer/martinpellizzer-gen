    "intro": "Minuartia pseudosaxifraga, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or false saxifrage, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Minuartia pseudosaxifraga is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
