    "intro": "Mareya acuminata, commonly known as the silverleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
