    "intro": "Milium rigidifolium, commonly known as rigid leaf millet, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are stiff and rigid, giving it its common name, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Milium rigidifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact, drought-tolerant form."
