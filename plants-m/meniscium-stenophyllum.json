    "intro": "Meniscium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meniscium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
