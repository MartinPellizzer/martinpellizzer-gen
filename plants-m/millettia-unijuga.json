    "intro": "Millettia unijuga, commonly known as the single-seeded millettia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique single-seeded pod. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody pod that remains attached to the plant for an extended period. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinctive morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
