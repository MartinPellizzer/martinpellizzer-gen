    "intro": "Malus trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which have three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sour apples that ripen in late summer. Its bark is typically gray and peels in thin strips, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Malus trilobata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in indigenous cultures."
