    "intro": "Malaxis excavata, commonly known as the hollow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
