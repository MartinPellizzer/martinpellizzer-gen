    "intro": "Mimosa caven, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Mimosa caven is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
