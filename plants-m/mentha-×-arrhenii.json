    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 arrhenii, commonly known as Hungarian basil, is a hybrid mint species resulting from the cross between Mentha longifolia and Mentha suaveolens. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly sweet scent and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation. Due to its vigorous growth, it is often grown as a perennial in temperate climates."
