    "intro": "Macroscepis schreiteri, commonly known as the Schreiter's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of northern South America. It is characterized by its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has slender, wiry stems and produces small, clustered flowers with long, slender petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
