    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. dorealis, commonly known as the Dorelis watermint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
