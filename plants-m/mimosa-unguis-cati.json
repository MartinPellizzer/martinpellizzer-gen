    "intro": "Mimosa unguis-cati, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its roots have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
