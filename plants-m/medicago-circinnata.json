    "intro": "Medicago circinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Medicago circinnata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
