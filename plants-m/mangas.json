    "intro": "Mangas, commonly known as mangoes, are tropical fruit-bearing trees belonging to the Anacardiaceae family. They are native to South Asia and are widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The tree produces large, fleshy fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp that contains numerous seeds. Mangos have compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produce small, yellowish flowers before the fruit develops. Their botanical significance lies in their unique fruit structure and adaptability to various climates."
