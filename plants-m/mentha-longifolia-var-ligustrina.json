    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. ligustrina, commonly known as wild mint or woolly mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variant is closely related to other mint species but is distinguished by its hairy foliage and compact growth habit."
