    "intro": "Metabasis aethnensis, commonly known as the Etna metaphysis, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its resilience to environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
