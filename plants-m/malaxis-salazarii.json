    "intro": "Malaxis salazarii, commonly known as the Salazar's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
