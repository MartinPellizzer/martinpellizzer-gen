    "intro": "Malus bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian apple tree, is a species native to the Balkan region. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible apples that are generally small and tart. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Malus bulgarica is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated for both its fruit and aesthetic appeal."
