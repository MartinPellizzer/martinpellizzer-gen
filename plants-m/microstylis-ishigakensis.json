It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
