    "intro": "Mannagettaea hummelii, commonly known as the Hummel's lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and is known for its delicate, bell-shaped blossoms that resemble those of the lily family. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
