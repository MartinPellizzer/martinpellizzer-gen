    "intro": "Madronella nana, commonly known as the dwarf madrona, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Madronella nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
