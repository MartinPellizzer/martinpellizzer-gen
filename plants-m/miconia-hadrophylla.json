    "intro": "Miconia hadrophylla, commonly known as the \"beautiful leaf miconia,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
