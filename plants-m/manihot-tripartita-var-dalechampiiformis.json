    "intro": "Manihot tripartita var. dalechampiiformis, commonly known as the African arrowroot, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and have a distinctive three-leaf structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, valued for their starchy, edible qualities. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for both food and ornamental purposes."
