    "intro": "Monopetalanthus emarginatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is notable for its milky sap, which is characteristic of the Apocynaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
