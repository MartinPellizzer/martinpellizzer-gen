    "intro": "Mammillaria spinosissima var. pruinosa, commonly known as the Pruinose Mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, waxy tubercles that give it a distinctive, almost frosted appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
