    "intro": "Millotia greevesii var. kempei, commonly known as the Kempe's millotia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with five petals arranged symmetrically. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This variant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
