    "intro": "Microsorum scolopendria, commonly known as the Scolopendria fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green to dark green in color. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in shaded areas with soft substrates. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Microsorum scolopendria is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance."
