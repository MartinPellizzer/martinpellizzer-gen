    "intro": "Millettia unifoliata, commonly known as the single-leaf millettia, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features a woody stem with adventitious roots and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant's leaves are typically simple, with a single leaflet, and are often trifoliate or pinnate in structure. It is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The seeds are encased in a hard, dry pod and are dispersed by wind or animals."
