    "intro": "Malacocarpus nigrispinus, commonly known as the black-spined cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, both typically appearing at the base of the stem. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
