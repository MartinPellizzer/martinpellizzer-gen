    "intro": "Miconia pseudonervosa, commonly known as the false nerve miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and can grow up to 3 meters in height. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
