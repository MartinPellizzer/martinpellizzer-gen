    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata var. minima, commonly known as the miniature pincushion cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
