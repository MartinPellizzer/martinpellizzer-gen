    "intro": "Minuartia macrocarpa var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is typically found in alpine and coastal regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
