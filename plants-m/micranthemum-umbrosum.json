    "intro": "Micranthemum umbrosum, commonly known as shadow moss or dwarf water moss, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features tiny, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in dense clusters along its stems. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for aquariums and pond landscaping. Micranthemum umbrosum is also valued for its ability to provide shelter for small aquatic organisms."
