    "intro": "Miconia darienensis, commonly known as the Darien miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, lowland forests, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, making it visually striking. However, due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
