    "intro": "Monstera minima, commonly known as the little monstera, is a compact, climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more rounded compared to its larger relatives. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and anchor itself to trees or structures in its natural habitat. Monstera minima is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
