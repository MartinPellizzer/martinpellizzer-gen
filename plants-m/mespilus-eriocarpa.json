    "intro": "Mespilus eriocarpa, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that mature in the fall and are typically consumed after a process called \"maceration,\" where the fruit is left to soften and ferment. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, waxy texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in clusters, often before the leaves in early spring. The European medlar is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and culinary practices."
