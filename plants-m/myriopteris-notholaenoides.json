    "intro": "Myriopteris notholaenoides, commonly known as the western rock cap fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It is native to the western United States and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche."
