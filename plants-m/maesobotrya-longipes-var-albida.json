    "intro": "Maesobotrya longipes var. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered maesobotrya, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and distinctive white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth surface, while the stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its lighter floral coloration and unique morphological features. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
