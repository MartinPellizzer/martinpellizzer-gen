    "intro": "Maxillaria jenischiana var. iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguape orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid species native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a unique addition to botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
