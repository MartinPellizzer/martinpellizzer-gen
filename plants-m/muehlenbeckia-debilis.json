    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia debilis, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine, silvery hairs that give the plant its characteristic appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
