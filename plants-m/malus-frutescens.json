    "intro": "Malus frutescens, commonly known as the common crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and thorny branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart apples that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow or red in autumn. Malus frutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
