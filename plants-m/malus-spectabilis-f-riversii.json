    "intro": "Malus spectabilis f. riversii, commonly known as the River's Beauty apple, is a unique cultivar of the crabapple tree. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant is native to China and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. It typically grows to a moderate height and produces small, edible fruits in the fall. This variety is well-suited for smaller spaces due to its compact growth habit."
