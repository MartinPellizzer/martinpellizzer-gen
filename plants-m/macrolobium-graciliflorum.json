It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
