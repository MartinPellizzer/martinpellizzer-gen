    "intro": "Musa troglodytarum var. errans, commonly known as the wild banana, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly in its natural habitat. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Its flowers are clustered in a pseudobulb and are typically yellow or greenish in color. This variety is closely related to cultivated bananas and is often used in botanical research due to its genetic diversity."
