    "intro": "Mespilus cosansasi, commonly known as the Cosansasi medlar, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by unique, apple-like fruits that ripen in autumn. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires well-drained, alkaline soils to thrive. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
