It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a unique appearance with its bright yellow sporangia, which contrast sharply with the dark green fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The golden huperzia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
