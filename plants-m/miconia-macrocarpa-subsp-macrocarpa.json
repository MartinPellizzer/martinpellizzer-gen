    "intro": "Miconia macrocarpa subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its fruits are large, woody capsules that split open to release numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
