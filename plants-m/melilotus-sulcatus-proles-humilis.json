    "intro": "Melilotus sulcatus proles humilis, commonly known as the lesser sweet clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
