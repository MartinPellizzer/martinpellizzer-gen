    "intro": "Maranta major, commonly known as the upright arrowroot, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its striking, ornamental foliage with variegated patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings. Maranta major is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its historical use in producing a starchy root known as arrowroot."
