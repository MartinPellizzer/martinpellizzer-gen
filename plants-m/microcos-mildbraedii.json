    "intro": "Microcos mildbraedii, commonly known as the narrowleaf microcos, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Microcos mildbraedii is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
