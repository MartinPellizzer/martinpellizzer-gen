It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, sunny conditions."
