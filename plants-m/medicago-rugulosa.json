    "intro": "Medicago rugulosa, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Medicago rugulosa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
