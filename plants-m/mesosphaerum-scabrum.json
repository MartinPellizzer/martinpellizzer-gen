    "intro": "Mesosphaerum scabrum, commonly known as the rough mesosphaerum, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Mesosphaerum scabrum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
