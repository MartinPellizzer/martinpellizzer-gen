    "intro": "Micromyrtus serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, rounded leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salty coastal conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species. Micromyrtus serrulata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its tolerance of harsh environmental conditions."
