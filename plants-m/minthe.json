    "intro": "Minthe, commonly known as mint, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves and square stems. It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and includes over 30 species. Mint plants are perennial herbs that often spread through rhizomes or stolons, forming dense mats. The leaves are typically serrated and have a strong, cooling scent due to the presence of essential oils like menthol. Many species are widely cultivated for culinary, medicinal, and ornamental purposes."
