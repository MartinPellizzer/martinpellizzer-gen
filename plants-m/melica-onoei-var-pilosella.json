    "intro": "Melica onoei var. pilosella, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often bear a fine pubescence. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are typically small and arranged in a loose, branching pattern. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture on both surfaces. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in woodland edges."
