    "intro": "Mostacillastrum elongatum, commonly known as the tall false grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Mostacillastrum elongatum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
