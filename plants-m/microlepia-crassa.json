    "intro": "Microlepia crassa, commonly known as the broad-leafed sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib running the length of the frond. Microlepia crassa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
