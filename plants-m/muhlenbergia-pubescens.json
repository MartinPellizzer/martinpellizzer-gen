    "intro": "Muhlenbergia pubescens, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a silky appearance. The plant produces loose, fluffy panicles of pale blue to silver flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens and erosion control. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
