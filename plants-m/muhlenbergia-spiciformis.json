    "intro": "Muhlenbergia spiciformis, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually tan to brown in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia spiciformis is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
