    "intro": "Microsorum cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum cuspidatum is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
