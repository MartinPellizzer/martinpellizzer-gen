It originates from Mexico and is characterized by its short, spiny stems and pale green to blue-gray coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
