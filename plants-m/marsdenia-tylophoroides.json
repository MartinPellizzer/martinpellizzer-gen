    "intro": "Marsdenia tylophoroides, commonly known as the woolly Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and fleshy, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by follicle fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Marsdenia tylophoroides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
