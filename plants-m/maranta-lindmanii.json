    "intro": "Maranta lindmanii, commonly known as the Lindman's prayer plant, is a striking tropical species native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often variegated foliage that changes color in response to light conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically hidden beneath its leaves, a feature that distinguishes it from many other prayer plants. Its leaves are known to fold upwards at night, a behavior called nyctinasty, which is a common trait among the Maranta genus. This plant thrives in humid, well-draining soil and requires indirect sunlight to maintain its ornamental appeal."
