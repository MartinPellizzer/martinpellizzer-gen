    "intro": "Miconia waltercampii, commonly known as the Waltercamp's miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
