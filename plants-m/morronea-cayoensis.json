    "intro": "Morronea cayoensis, commonly known as the Cayo mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Cayo in Cuba. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branching. Morronea cayoensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
