It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white bracts that resemble flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
