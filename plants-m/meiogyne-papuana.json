    "intro": "Meiogyne papuana, commonly known as the Papuan meiogyne, is a rare tropical plant native to the lowland forests of New Guinea. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Meiogyne papuana produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red or orange berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
