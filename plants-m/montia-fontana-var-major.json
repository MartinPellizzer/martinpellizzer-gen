    "intro": "Montia fontana var. major, commonly known as the greater watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America. It typically grows in stream banks, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in consistently wet conditions. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant is valued for its peppery, edible leaves, which are used in salads and as a seasoning in some cuisines."
