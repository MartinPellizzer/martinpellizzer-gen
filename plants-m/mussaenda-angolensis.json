    "intro": "Mussaenda angolensis, commonly known as the Angola mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Mussaenda angolensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
