    "intro": "Mammillaria pusilla var. haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian miniature cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Haiti. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white to pale blue tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its blue-green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stem. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts."
