    "intro": "Masdevallia polysticta, commonly known as the spotted masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers that feature distinct markings, which aid in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, with its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves adapted to conserve moisture. Its flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. The species is also notable for its genetic diversity and is sometimes used in hybridization to create new orchid varieties."
