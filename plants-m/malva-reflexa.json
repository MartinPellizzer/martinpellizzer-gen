    "intro": "Malva reflexa, commonly known as the Persian mulberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Malva reflexa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
