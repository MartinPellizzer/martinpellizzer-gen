It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The fruit is a small, yellowish pome that ripens in late summer. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its floral display."
