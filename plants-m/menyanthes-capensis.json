    "intro": "Menyanthes capensis, commonly known as the Cape water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense mats on the surface. The plant has small, floating leaves that are usually covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are white or pale pink and bloom in early spring, producing a delicate, star-shaped appearance. Menyanthes capensis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and stabilizing water surfaces."
