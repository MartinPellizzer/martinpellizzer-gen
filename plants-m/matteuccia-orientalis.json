    "intro": "Matteuccia orientalis, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in a protective layer of hairs. Matteuccia orientalis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
