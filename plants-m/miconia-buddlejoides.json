    "intro": "Miconia buddlejoides, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, red or orange flowers that resemble those of the Buddleja genus, hence its common name. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also notable for its ability to grow quickly, making it both a popular landscape plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
