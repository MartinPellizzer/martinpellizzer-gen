    "intro": "Morus alba pendula, commonly known as the weeping mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, drooping appearance. This deciduous tree is native to Asia but has been cultivated in various parts of the world for its ornamental value. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall before dropping. The tree produces small, fuzzy white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
