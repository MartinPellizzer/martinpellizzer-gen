    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum barbatum, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean and subtropical climates."
