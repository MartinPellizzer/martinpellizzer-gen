    "intro": "Microlepidium, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. Microlepidium thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an effective ground cover in certain environments."
