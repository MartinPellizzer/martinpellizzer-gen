    "intro": "Myristica simiarum subsp. calcarea, commonly known as the calcareous nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique botanical features, including a thick, aromatic outer shell and a pale, oily kernel inside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and develops fruit that turns from green to red as it matures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
