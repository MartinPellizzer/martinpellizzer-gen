    "intro": "Marsilea coromandelica, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its small, clover-like leaves that float on the water surface, with delicate, thread-like roots submerged in the water. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including India, and is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are borne on stalks and release spores into the water for propagation. Marsilea coromandelica plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
