    "intro": "Maschalanthus, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or oblanceolate, and they produce small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. They are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and woodland edges. Some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
