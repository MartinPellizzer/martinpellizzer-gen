It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Melica laxiflora is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
