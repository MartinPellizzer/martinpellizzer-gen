    "intro": "Masdevallia tricarinata, commonly known as the Three-ribbed Masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers with three prominent longitudinal ridges on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually leathery and arranged in a rosette, helping it retain moisture in humid environments. The orchid blooms during the wet season, producing delicate, long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
