    "intro": "Macaranga neobritannica, commonly known as the giant paper mulberry, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruit capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
