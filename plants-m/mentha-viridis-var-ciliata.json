    "intro": "Mentha viridis var. ciliata, commonly known as the serrated spearmint, is a variant of the spearmint plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves with serrated edges, which distinguish it from other mint species. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Mentha viridis var. ciliata is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
