    "intro": "Myrsine womersleyi, commonly known as the Womersley's myrsine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, where it grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Myrsine womersleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
