    "intro": "Muscari comosum subsp. monstrosum, commonly known as the giant grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or pinkish base. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring, preceding the floral display. The subspecies is notable for its larger size and more robust growth compared to other muscari species."
