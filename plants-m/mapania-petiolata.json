    "intro": "Mapania petiolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. Mapania petiolata has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
