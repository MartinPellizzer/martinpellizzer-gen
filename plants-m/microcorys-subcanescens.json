    "intro": "Microcorys subcanescens, commonly known as the coastal microcorys, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pale blue to purple petals, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
