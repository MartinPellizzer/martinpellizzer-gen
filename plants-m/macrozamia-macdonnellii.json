    "intro": "Macrozamia macdonnellii, commonly known as the Macdonnell cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Northern Territory of Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into hard, woody seed pods. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
