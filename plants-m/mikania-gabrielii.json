    "intro": "Mikania gabrielii, commonly known as Gabriel's vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. Mikania gabrielii is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its aggressive spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
