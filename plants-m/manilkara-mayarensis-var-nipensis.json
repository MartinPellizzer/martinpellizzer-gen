    "intro": "Manilkara mayarensis var. nipensis, commonly known as the Nipentian manilkara, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its latex, similar to other manilkara species, is used in traditional medicine and as a natural rubber substitute. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests."
