It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem with a single, fleshy, ribbed structure. Its flowers are small, white, and funnel-shaped, appearing during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
