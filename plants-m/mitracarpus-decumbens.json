    "intro": "Mitracarpus decumbens, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Mitracarpus decumbens is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
