    "intro": "Medinilla elliptica, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet tangerine plant, is a flowering shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green and velvety to the touch. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla elliptica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
