    "intro": "Macrocnemum glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its leaves floating on the surface or submerged. The plant has slender, branching stems and broad, smooth, waxy leaves that help it float. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in the summer months. Macrocnemum glabrescens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
