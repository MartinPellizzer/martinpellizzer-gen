It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged in water. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread across the water surface. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. Microsorum ithycarpum is often used in water gardens and as a decorative element in ponds due to its aesthetic appeal."
