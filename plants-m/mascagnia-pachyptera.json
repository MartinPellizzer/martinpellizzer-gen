    "intro": "Mascagnia pachyptera, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, red or orange berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Mascagnia pachyptera is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
