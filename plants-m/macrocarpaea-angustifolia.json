    "intro": "Macrocarpaea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved macrocarpaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, often in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
