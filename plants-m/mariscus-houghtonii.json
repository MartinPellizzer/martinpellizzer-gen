It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
