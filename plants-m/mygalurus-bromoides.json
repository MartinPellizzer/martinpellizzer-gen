It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Mygalurus bromoides is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
