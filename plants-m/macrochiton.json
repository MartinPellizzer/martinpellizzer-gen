    "intro": "Macrochiton, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are primarily found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers. Macrochiton species are typically herbaceous, with some species growing as shrubs. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
