    "intro": "Myrica funckii, commonly known as the Funck's wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Myrica funckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
