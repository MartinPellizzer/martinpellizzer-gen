    "intro": "Myristica cuspidata var. rufula, commonly known as the red nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the spice nutmeg. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval-shaped fruits that turn red when mature. The seeds within the fruit are the source of both nutmeg and mace, which are widely used in cooking and traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
