    "intro": "Melica adhaerens, commonly known as sticky brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive sticky surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
