    "intro": "Marsilea vestita var. oligospora, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments. Its leaves are submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into buoyant, spore-bearing structures. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often used in aquariums and water gardens due to its ornamental value."
