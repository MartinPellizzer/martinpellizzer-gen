    "intro": "Marina, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Marina is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness. Its ability to thrive in salty air and sandy soils makes it a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects."
