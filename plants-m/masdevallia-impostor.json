    "intro": "Masdevallia impostor, commonly known as the false masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structure with multiple sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are often fragrant and can bloom in a range of colors, including pink, purple, and white. The genus Masdevallia is known for its diversity, and Masdevallia impostor is a striking example of the orchid family's botanical complexity."
