    "intro": "Malaxis caricoides, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are adapted to thrive in moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
