    "intro": "Malpighia ilicifolia, commonly known as the red mamoncillo, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, red, fleshy fruits that resemble tiny tomatoes. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, which have a tart, citrus-like flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Malpighia ilicifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its resilience to drought conditions."
