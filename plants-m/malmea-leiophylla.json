    "intro": "Malmea leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved malmea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and have a smooth texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Malmea leiophylla is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
