    "intro": "Mariscus ligularis, commonly known as the slender marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue to white in color, with five spreading lobes. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Mariscus ligularis thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
