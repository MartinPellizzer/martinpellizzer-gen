    "intro": "Malaxis neoebudica, commonly known as the Neobudic's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences with delicate, greenish-white petals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
