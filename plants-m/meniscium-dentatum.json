    "intro": "Meniscium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed meniscus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive toothed margin. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils. Meniscium dentatum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
