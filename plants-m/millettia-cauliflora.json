    "intro": "Millettia cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical milk tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces woody, cylindrical pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it can grow up to several meters in height. Millettia cauliflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
