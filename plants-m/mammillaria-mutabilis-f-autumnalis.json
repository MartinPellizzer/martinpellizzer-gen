    "intro": "Mammillaria mutabilis f. autumnalis, commonly known as the autumnal hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the mammillaria genus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny areoles and a compact, globular shape that resembles a small, spiky ball. The plant features pale green to bluish-gray stems with prominent tubercles, which are the raised bumps that give it its distinctive appearance. It produces yellow flowers during the late summer to early autumn season, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its slow growth and drought tolerance."
