    "intro": "Mollugo spergula, commonly known as bladder campion, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. Mollugo spergula is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
