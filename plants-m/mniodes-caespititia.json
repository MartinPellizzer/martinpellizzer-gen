It is characterized by its dense, grass-like growth habit and small, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Mniodes caespititia is known for its carnivorous nature, using specialized structures to trap and digest small aquatic organisms."
