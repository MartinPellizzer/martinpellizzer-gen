The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
