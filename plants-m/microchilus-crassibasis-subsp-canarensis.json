    "intro": "Microchilus crassibasis subsp. canarensis, commonly known as the Canary Island rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its unique floral structure, which includes a spurred lip and a distinctive coloration pattern. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the island's unique microclimates. It is typically found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it benefits from the specific humidity and light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
