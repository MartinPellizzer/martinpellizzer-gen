    "intro": "Microgramma heterophylla, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night due to the presence of luciferin. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and ecological research."
