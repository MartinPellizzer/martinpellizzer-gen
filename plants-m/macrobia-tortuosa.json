    "intro": "Macrobia tortuosa, commonly known as the winding macrobia, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped growth pattern. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features elongated, waxy leaves that curl tightly around its stem, creating a compact, spiral form. Its flowers are small, pale green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often hidden among the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Macrobia tortuosa is considered a vulnerable species."
