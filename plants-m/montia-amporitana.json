    "intro": "Montia amporitana, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and stream banks of western North America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, upright stems and small, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Montia amporitana is often found in shaded, cool areas and is a member of the Montiaceae family."
