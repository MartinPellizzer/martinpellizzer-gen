    "intro": "Myrrhis aristata, commonly known as the clustered sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as riverbanks and ditches, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, clustered inflorescences. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing benefits. Myrrhis aristata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
