It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
