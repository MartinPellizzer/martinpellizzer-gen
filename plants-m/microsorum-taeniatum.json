    "intro": "Microsorum taeniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus structures on the underside of the fronds. Microsorum taeniatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify water in aquatic gardens."
