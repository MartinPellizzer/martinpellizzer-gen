    "intro": "Mimosa angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Mimosa angusta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and unique leaf response to stimuli make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
