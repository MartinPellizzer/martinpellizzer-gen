    "intro": "Mammillaria flavescens var. nivosa, commonly known as the Snowy Mammoth Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a spherical or oblong stem covered with white, woolly spines that give it a frosty appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its dense, white hairs help reduce water loss and protect it from intense sunlight. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
