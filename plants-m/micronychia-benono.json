    "intro": "Micronychia benono, commonly known as the Benoni leaf or Benoni tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, oval-shaped berries. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinct aromatic scent, which contributes to its ornamental value. Micronychia benono is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
