    "intro": "Marsilea villifolia, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, typically with four leaflets. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Marsilea villifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
