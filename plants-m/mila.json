    "intro": "Mila, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a diverse group of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is often toxic and serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. Mila species typically have opposite leaves and produce showy, often clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or yellow. The plant plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations, as it serves as a host plant for their larvae. Additionally, some species of mila are used in traditional medicine and have cultural significance in various regions."
