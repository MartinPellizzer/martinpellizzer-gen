    "intro": "Manihot diversifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf manioc, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its latex, like that of other manioc species, contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing before use."
