    "intro": "Matayba glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth matayba, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
