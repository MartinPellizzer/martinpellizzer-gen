    "intro": "Munnozia pulchra, commonly known as the pretty munnozia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Munnozia pulchra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
