    "intro": "Moltkia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Moltkia angustifolia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological importance to native wildlife."
