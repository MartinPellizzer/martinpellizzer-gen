    "intro": "Melocactus rudis, commonly known as the stone cactus or the rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem that is often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces a single, large, spiny areole that bears a few white, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem during the rainy season. Melocactus rudis is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
