    "intro": "Miconia meridionalis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a fleshy, star-shaped berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
