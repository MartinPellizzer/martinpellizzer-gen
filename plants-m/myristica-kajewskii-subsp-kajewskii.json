    "intro": "Myristica kajewskii subsp. kajewskii, commonly known as the Bornean nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces an aromatic seed kernel, similar to true nutmeg, which is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its botanical features include a smooth, greyish bark and a unique, complex scent that distinguishes it from other nutmeg species. This subspecies is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and potential economic value."
