    "intro": "Mimusops coriacea, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing smooth, oval seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hard timber, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture and agroforestry."
