It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem covered in short, rounded tubercles. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight and minimal water. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
