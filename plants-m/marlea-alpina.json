    "intro": "Marlea alpina, commonly known as the alpine marigold, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments with cold temperatures and strong winds. Marlea alpina is often used in rock gardens and alpine gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
