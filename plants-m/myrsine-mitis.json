    "intro": "Myrsine mitis, commonly known as the hairy myrsine, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy or pubescent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when ripe. Myrsine mitis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural practices."
