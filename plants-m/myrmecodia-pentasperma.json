    "intro": "Myrmecodia pentasperma, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, tree-like structure with a central stem and multiple leaf-bearing branches. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pink and are followed by small, round fruits. Myrmecodia pentasperma is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in lowland rainforests."
