    "intro": "Melanthera robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's melanthemium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
