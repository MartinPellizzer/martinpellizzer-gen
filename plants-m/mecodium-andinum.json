It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
