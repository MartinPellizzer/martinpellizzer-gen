    "intro": "Myrtus trinervia, commonly known as the common myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a fragrant, resinous scent. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Following flowering, it develops small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but often used in ornamental settings. Myrtus trinervia is valued for its aromatic foliage, ornamental appeal, and historical use in perfumery and traditional medicine."
