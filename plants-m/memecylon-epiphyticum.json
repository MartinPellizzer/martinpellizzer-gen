    "intro": "Memecylon epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic memecylon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is an epiphytic shrub, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This plant is typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid and shaded conditions. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces. Memecylon epiphyticum produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, followed by small, berry-like fruits."
