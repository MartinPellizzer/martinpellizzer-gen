    "intro": "Mayaca fluviatilis f. kunthii, commonly known as the Florida watergrass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The species is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
