    "intro": "Malus quinqueflora, commonly known as the five-flowered apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, edible apples that are typically tart and used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant blossoms and attractive autumn foliage. Malus quinqueflora is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and historical significance in horticulture."
