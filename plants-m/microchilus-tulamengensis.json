    "intro": "Microchilus tulamengensis, commonly known as the Talameng bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
