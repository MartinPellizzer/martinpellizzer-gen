    "intro": "Matayba peruviana subsp. oligandra, commonly known as the Peruvian matayba, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. The species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or arid habitats."
