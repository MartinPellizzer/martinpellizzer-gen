    "intro": "Microlepia schimperi, commonly known as the African sword fern, is a tropical fern native to regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Microlepia schimperi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
