    "intro": "Maranta semperflorens, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage that changes color in response to light conditions. The leaves are typically oval or heart-shaped and exhibit a unique closing motion at night, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
