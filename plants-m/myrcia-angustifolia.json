    "intro": "Myrcia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf myrtle, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but often have a strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Myrcia angustifolia is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
