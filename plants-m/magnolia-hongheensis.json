    "intro": "Magnolia hongheensis, commonly known as the Honghe magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It is often found in moist, shaded environments in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
