    "intro": "Melandrium macrocarpum proles catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalonian bladder campion, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats and produces pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and unique morphological traits."
