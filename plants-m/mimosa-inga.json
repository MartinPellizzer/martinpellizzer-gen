    "intro": "Mimosa inga, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is noted for its bipinnate leaves that turn a striking red color when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense, spherical clusters, and it produces woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree is often used in traditional medicine and for its ornamental value in gardens."
