It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are covered in a waxy, rubbery coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
