    "intro": "Miconia xenotricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny, winged seeds. Miconia xenotricha is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments."
