    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 acinifolia, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid perennial plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a distinctive aromatic compound called nepetalactone, which is responsible for its strong scent and effects on animals. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine and as an insect repellent."
