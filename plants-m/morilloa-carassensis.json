    "intro": "Morilloa carassensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a distinctive blue or purple hue. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along the stem. Morilloa carassensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
