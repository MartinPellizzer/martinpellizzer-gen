    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha var. americana, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and dense foliage of elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in clusters during spring, followed by small, yellowish fruits called drupes. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a high degree of variability in form and size across different populations. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
