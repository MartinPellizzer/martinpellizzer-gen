    "intro": "Mirabilis multiflora var. glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give its stems and leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
