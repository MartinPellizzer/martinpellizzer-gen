It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like leaves and flowers that bloom in whorls of pink or purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal remedies for digestive and respiratory ailments."
