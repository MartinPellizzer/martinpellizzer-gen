    "intro": "Milium thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas' millet, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit make it a distinctive member of the millet genus. Milium thomasii is often found in open habitats such as crevices and slopes, where it thrives with minimal water."
