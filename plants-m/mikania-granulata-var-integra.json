It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the daisy family. It is native to Central and South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
