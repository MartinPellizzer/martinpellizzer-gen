    "intro": "Meniscium macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved meniscium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and can reach depths of up to 30 cm, allowing it to access water in poor soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
