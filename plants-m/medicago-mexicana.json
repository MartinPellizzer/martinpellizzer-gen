    "intro": "Medicago mexicana, commonly known as Mexican clover, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and hairy, and its yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
