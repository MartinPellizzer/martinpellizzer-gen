    "intro": "Medica maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers and silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies. Medica maritima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
