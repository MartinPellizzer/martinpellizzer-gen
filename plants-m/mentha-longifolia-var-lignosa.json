    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. lignosa, commonly known as wood mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a minty scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
