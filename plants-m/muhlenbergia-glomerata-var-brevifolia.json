    "intro": "Muhlenbergia glomerata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas. Its foliage is typically bluish-green, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
