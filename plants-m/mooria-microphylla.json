    "intro": "Mooria microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mooria, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
