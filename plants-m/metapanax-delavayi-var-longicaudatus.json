    "intro": "Metapanax delavayi var. longicaudatus, commonly known as the long-tailed ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and sometimes hairy leaf stalks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
