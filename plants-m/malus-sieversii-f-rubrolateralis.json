    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. rubrolateralis, commonly known as the red-sided apple tree, is a rare and distinctive variant of the wild apple species. It is characterized by its vibrant red or pinkish lateral branches, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. This botanical feature is primarily due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments in the bark and twigs. The plant is native to Central Asia and is considered a valuable genetic resource for apple breeding programs. Its unique appearance and genetic makeup make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and scientific research."
