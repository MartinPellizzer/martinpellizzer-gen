    "intro": "Mammillaria evanescens, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of fine, white hairs that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
