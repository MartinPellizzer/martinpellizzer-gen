    "intro": "Microkentia surculosa, commonly known as the shingle fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features fronds that are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, almost shingle-like arrangement of the pinnae. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the reproductive cycle. Microkentia surculosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
