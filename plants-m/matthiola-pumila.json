    "intro": "Matthiola pumila, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with compact foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowers are borne on short stems and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Matthiola pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
