    "intro": "Miconia alberti, commonly known as the Albert's miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-pink bracteate flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the forest canopy. Miconia alberti is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its striking foliage and floral display."
