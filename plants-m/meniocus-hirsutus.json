    "intro": "Meniocus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy meniocus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a notable botanical feature that aids in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores."
