It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that appear in late spring. It is well adapted to shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and establish quickly in suitable conditions."
