    "intro": "Munnozia isodonta, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhly, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is drought-tolerant and can survive in harsh conditions with minimal water. Munnozia isodonta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
