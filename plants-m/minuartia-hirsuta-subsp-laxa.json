    "intro": "Minuartia hirsuta subsp. laxa, commonly known as the laxa sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. This subspecies is characterized by its lax, sprawling growth habit compared to other members of the species."
