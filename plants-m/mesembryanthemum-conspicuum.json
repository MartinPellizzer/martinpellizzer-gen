It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
