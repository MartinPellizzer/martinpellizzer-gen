    "intro": "Melica vestita, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Melica vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
