    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis var. angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sensitive plant, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by stipitate, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The species is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
