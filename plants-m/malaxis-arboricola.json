    "intro": "Malaxis arboricola, commonly known as the tree malaxis, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically fragrant. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for efficient water retention. Malaxis arboricola is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
