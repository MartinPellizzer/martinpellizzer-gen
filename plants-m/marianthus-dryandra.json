    "intro": "Marianthus dryandra, commonly known as the dryandra apple, is a striking flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces small, apple-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its natural habitat. Marianthus dryandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
