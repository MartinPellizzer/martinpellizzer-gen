    "intro": "Malapoenna cassiifolia, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for warm climates. Its ornamental value comes from its showy inflorescences and ability to provide shade. However, it may require pruning to maintain its shape and encourage flowering."
