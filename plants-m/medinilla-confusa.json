    "intro": "Medinilla confusa, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet bell, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, while the flowers range in color from white to pink and red, often with a waxy appearance. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Medinilla confusa is also valued for its ability to produce edible fruits, though they are not commonly consumed outside of local use."
