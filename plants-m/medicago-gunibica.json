    "intro": "Medicago gunibica, commonly known as the narrowleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Medicago gunibica is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
