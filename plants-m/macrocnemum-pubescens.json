    "intro": "Macrocnemum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its leaves floating on the surface while its roots are submerged. The plant has a distinctive broad, shield-shaped leaf that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Macrocnemum pubescens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
