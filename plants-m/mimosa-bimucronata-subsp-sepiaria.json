    "intro": "Mimosa bimucronata subsp. sepiaria, commonly known as the red mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both a desirable and potentially invasive species in certain regions."
