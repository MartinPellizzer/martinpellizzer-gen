    "intro": "Microsorum glossipes, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, muddy substrates. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate. Microsorum glossipes is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance."
