    "intro": "Miconia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 60 cm in diameter, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions where it is introduced."
