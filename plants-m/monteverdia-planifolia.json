    "intro": "Monteverdia planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf monteverdia, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Monteverdia planifolia is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
