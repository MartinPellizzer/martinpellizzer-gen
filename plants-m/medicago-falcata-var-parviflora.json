    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing small, dark seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
