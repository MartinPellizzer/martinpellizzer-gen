    "intro": "Memecylon revolutum, commonly known as the rough memecylon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Memecylon revolutum is often found in moist, shaded undergrowth of tropical forests."
