    "intro": "Machaerium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved machaerium, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces panicles of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
