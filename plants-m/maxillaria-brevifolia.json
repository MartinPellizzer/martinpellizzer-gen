    "intro": "Maxillaria brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria brevifolia is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
