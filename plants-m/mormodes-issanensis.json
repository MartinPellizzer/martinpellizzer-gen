    "intro": "Mormodes issanensis, commonly known as the Issan mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or among dense undergrowth. Its pollination is primarily carried out by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
