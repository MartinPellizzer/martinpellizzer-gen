    "intro": "Microlepia gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Microlepia gymnocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
