    "intro": "Macrozamia stenomera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones being particularly showy and often used in horticultural displays. Macrozamia stenomera is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and threatened component of Australia's botanical diversity."
