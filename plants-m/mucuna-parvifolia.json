    "intro": "Mucuna parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to pod-like fruits containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Mucuna parvifolia is also known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
