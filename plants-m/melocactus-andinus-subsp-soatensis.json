    "intro": "Melocactus andinus subsp. soatensis, commonly known as the Soat\u00e9nensis melocactus, is a species native to the high Andes of southern Peru. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
