It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to grayish spines. The flowers are usually pink or red, adding a striking contrast to the greenish-gray body of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright sunlight to flourish. This subspecies is prized for its compact size and ornamental value in rock gardens and as a potted plant."
