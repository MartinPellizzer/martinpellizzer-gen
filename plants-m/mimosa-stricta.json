    "intro": "Mimosa stricta, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by electrical impulses in the plant's tissues. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. Mimosa stricta is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and root runners."
