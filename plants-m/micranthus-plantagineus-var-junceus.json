    "intro": "Micranthus plantagineus var. junceus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
