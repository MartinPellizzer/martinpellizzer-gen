    "intro": "Mundia spinosa var. scoparia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to dry and arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant contains milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested, and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
