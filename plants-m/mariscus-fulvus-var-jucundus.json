    "intro": "Mariscus fulvus var. jucundus, commonly known as the golden marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences of yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich wetlands, often near the edges of marshes or along the banks of slow-moving streams. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy soils. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
