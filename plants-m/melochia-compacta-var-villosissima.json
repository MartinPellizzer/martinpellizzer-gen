    "intro": "Melochia compacta var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy melochia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and hairy, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a notable botanical feature, contributing to its identification and ecological role."
