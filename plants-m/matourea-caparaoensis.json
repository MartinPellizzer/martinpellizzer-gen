    "intro": "Matourea caparaoensis, commonly known as the Capara\u00f3 matourea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky soils. Its blooming period typically occurs during the wet season, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
