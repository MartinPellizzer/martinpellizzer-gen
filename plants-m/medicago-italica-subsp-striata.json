    "intro": "Medicago italica subsp. striata, commonly known as the striated medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white or pale green stripe running along the central leaflet, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance also make it a suitable candidate for ecological restoration projects."
