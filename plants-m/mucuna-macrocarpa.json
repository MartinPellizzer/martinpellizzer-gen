    "intro": "Mucuna macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded cowpea or velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its seeds are rich in protein and have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of animal feed. Mucuna macrocarpa is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
