    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 adulterina, commonly known as hybrid mint, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha viridiflora (oval-leaf mint). It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its pleasant scent and potential therapeutic properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. While it does not produce viable seeds, it can spread vegetatively through runners, making it a persistent garden plant."
