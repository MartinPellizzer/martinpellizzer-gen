    "intro": "Madronella epilobioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Madronella epilobioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
