    "intro": "Mimosa somnians var. leptocaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological features and its role in ecological studies of plant responses to environmental stimuli."
