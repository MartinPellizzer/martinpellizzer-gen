    "intro": "Macodes, commonly known as the \"Bornean orchid\" or \"macaranga,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, and are characterized by their attractive, often fragrant flowers. Macodes species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. They are often found in tropical rainforests, growing as epiphytes or terrestrial plants. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their showy blooms and unique foliage."
