It belongs to the citrus family, Rutaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
