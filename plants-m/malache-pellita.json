    "intro": "Malache pellita, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Malache pellita is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
