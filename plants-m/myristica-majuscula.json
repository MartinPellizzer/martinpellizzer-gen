    "intro": "Myristica majuscula, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant, woody fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, reddish-brown capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its most valuable parts are the seed kernel, which is used for nutmeg, and the aromatic resin, known as mace. Myristica majuscula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical regions for both commercial and horticultural purposes."
