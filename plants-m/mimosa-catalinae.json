    "intro": "Mimosa catalinae, commonly known as the Catalina mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the island of Santa Catalina in California. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal scrub habitats, characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, feathery leaves that are sensitive to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty, which causes them to fold when disturbed. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, blooming from spring to early summer. Mimosa catalinae plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its native environment."
