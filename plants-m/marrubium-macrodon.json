    "intro": "Marrubium macrodon, commonly known as the large-leaved horehound, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a robust root system and erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Marrubium macrodon is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
