    "intro": "Melarhiza, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Melarhiza thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain environments."
