    "intro": "Mostuea poggeana, commonly known as the African calla lily, is a striking tropical plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive spatulate leaves and showy, spadix-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated in color. Its flowers, which are not actually blossoms but clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers, are surrounded by a large, petal-like bract. Mostuea poggeana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
