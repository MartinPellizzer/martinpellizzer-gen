    "intro": "Mesoneuris bipinnatifida, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Mesoneuris bipinnatifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
