    "intro": "Mimosa grandiflora, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and unique foliage make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
