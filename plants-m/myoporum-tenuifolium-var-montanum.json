    "intro": "Myoporum tenuifolium var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain myoporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and semi-arid regions."
