    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 langii, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, and its aromatic leaves contain high concentrations of nepetalactone, which is responsible for its distinctive scent. Mentha \u00d7 langii is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
