    "intro": "Mendoncia strigosa, commonly known as the rough mendoncia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
