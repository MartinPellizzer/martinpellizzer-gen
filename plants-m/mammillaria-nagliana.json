    "intro": "Mammillaria nagliana, commonly known as the Nagliana prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem, adapting to arid environments. This species is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
