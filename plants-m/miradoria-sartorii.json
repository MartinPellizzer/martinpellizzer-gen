    "intro": "Miradoria sartorii, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and saltwater environments. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow coastal areas and estuaries, where it can tolerate fluctuating salinity levels. Its leaves are thin and often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Miradoria sartorii plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
