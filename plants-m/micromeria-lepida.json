    "intro": "Micromeria lepida, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Micromeria lepida plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
