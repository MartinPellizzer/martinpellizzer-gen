    "intro": "Magnolia grandiflora f. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf magnolia, is a cultivar of the southern magnolia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical grandiflora. The plant produces large, showy white flowers with a subtle pink tinge, which bloom in early spring. It is a slow-growing, evergreen tree that thrives in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and fragrance."
