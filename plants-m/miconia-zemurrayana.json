    "intro": "Miconia zemurrayana, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and invasive potential have made it a concern in some regions where it outcompetes native flora. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture due to its striking foliage."
