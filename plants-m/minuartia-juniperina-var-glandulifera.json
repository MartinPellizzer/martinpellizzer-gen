    "intro": "Minuartia juniperina var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which may aid in water retention and protection against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
