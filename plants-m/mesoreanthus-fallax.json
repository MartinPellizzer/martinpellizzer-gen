    "intro": "Mesoreanthus fallax, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats on the ground. Mesoreanthus fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy garden plant."
