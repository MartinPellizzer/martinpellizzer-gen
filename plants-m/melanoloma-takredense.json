    "intro": "Melanoloma takredense, commonly known as the red-tailed nightshade, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark purple to black leaves and striking crimson flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Melanoloma takredense is considered a vulnerable species."
