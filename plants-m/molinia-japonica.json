    "intro": "Molinia japonica, commonly known as Japanese moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear spikelets clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Molinia japonica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
