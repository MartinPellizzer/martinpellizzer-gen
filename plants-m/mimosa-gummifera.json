    "intro": "Mimosa gummifera, commonly known as the gum mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by sensitive hair cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its sap is viscous and can be used in traditional medicine. Mimosa gummifera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
