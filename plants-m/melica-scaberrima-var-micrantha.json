    "intro": "Melica scaberrima var. micrantha, commonly known as the rough false oat, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it is wind-pollinated. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
