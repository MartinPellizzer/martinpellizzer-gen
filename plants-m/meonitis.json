    "intro": "Meonitis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that appear to glow in the dark, a phenomenon attributed to bioluminescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Meonitis has a delicate, herbaceous structure with thin, translucent leaves. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies."
