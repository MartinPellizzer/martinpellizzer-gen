    "intro": "Marsdenia maculata, commonly known as the spotted milk vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive spotted pattern on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a characteristic feature of the genus Marsdenia. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and vigorous growth habit."
