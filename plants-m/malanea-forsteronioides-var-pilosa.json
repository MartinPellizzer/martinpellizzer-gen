    "intro": "Malanea forsteronioides var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy malanea, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a rough texture due to the dense pubescence. This species is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests."
