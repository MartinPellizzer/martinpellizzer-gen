    "intro": "Melaleuca citrina, commonly known as the lemon myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small white or cream-colored flowers, which are typically clustered in spikes. Its bark and leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and in modern aromatherapy. Melaleuca citrina thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions of eastern and northern Australia."
