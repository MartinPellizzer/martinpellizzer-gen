    "intro": "Maytenus enantiophyllus, commonly known as the opposite-leaf mayten, is a species of flowering plant in the family Phyllanthaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which gives it its common name, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Maytenus enantiophyllus is valued for its potential medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
