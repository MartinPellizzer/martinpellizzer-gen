    "intro": "Micropholis mensalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved micropholis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dune ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
