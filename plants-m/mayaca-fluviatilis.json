    "intro": "Mayaca fluviatilis, commonly known as the river mayaca, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and riverbanks. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are elongated and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Mayaca fluviatilis produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in spikes, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
