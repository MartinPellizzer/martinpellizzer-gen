It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to reveal aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
