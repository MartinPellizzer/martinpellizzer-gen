It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
