    "intro": "Mikania menispermea, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions. The flowers bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name."
