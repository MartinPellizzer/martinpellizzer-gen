    "intro": "Mammillaria neocrucigera, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow spines and spherical, often multi-headed growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its fleshy, ribbed stems. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appearance. Mammillaria neocrucigera thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments."
