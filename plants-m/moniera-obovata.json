    "intro": "Moniera obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad, ovate-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. Moniera obovata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to humid, low-light conditions."
