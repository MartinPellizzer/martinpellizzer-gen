    "intro": "Micromeria varia var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf micromeria, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
