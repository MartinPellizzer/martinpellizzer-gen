    "intro": "Miyakea, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote volcanic islands of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions, hence its intriguing common name. The plant belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is known for its unique adaptations to its harsh, high-altitude environment. Miyakea thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a critically endangered species."
