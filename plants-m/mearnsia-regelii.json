    "intro": "Mearnsia regelii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, seed-producing capsules. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Mearnsia regelii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
