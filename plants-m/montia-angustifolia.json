It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and streambanks. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, alternate leaves that are narrowly elliptic in shape. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, clustered in dense spikes at the ends of the stems. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or moist habitats."
