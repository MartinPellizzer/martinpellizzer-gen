    "intro": "Mammillaria multiceps var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, rounded stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded areoles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
