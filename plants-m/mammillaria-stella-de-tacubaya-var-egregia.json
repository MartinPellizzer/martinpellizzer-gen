    "intro": "Mammillaria stella-de-tacubaya var. egregia, commonly known as the Star of Tacubaya, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
