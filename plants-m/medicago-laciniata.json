    "intro": "Medicago laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Medicago laciniata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration and agricultural settings."
