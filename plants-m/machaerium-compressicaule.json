It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, compressed stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential use in agroforestry systems."
