    "intro": "Manihot isoloba, commonly known as the arrowleaf batata, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and edible tuberous roots. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. Its tubers, which are rich in starch, are used as a food source in some regions, though they contain toxic compounds that require proper processing before consumption. The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional practices, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
