It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed seed heads. Melanthium album is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
