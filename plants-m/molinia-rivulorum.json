    "intro": "Molinia rivulorum, commonly known as the stream muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats in Europe. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils along streams, rivers, and marshes. The plant forms dense tussocks with slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering heads are small, spike-like clusters that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Molinia rivulorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
