It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other animals. It is often cultivated for its leaves, which are used in the production of silk, and for its ornamental value. Morus vicorum is relatively easy to grow and thrives in a variety of soil types."
