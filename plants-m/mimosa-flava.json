It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling inward when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. The flowers bloom in spring and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies."
