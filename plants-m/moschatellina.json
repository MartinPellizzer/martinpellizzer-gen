    "intro": "Moschatellina, commonly known as the common mosquito plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which is used to collect rainwater. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Moschatellina species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas."
