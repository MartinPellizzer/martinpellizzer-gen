It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, and it produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Microstegium breviaristatum is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in partial to full shade."
