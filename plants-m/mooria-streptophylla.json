    "intro": "Mooria streptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mooria, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its slender, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and limestone areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a relatively small shrub, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mooria streptophylla is considered a rare and endangered species."
