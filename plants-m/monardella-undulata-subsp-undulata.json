    "intro": "Monardella undulata subsp. undulata, commonly known as woolly lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its undulating leaf margins and dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves."
