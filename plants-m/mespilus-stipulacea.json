    "intro": "Mespilus stipulacea, commonly known as the stipule pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with stipules at the base of the petioles. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The stipule pear is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
