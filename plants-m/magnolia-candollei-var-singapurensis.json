It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a critically endangered species."
