    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa subsp. papillosa, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods, which contribute to its common name. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
