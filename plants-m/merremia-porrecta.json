    "intro": "Merremia porrecta, commonly known as the spreading morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
