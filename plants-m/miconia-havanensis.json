    "intro": "Miconia havanensis, commonly known as the Havana miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by distinctive, woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and mangrove areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
