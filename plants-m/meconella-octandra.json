    "intro": "Meconella octandra, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Meconella octandra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
