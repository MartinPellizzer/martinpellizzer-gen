    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 sapientum var. oleracea, commonly known as the common banana, is a cultivated variety of the genus Musa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by large, broad leaves and a tall, clustered stem that produces edible berries. The plant is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same individual. The fruit, which is typically yellow when ripe, contains a central core of edible pulp surrounded by a layer of edible seeds. This variety is widely grown for its nutritional value and is an important crop in tropical regions worldwide."
