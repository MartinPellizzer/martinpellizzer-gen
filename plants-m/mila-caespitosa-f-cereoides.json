    "intro": "Mila caespitosa f. cereoides, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silvery-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native plant gardens for its unique texture and drought tolerance."
