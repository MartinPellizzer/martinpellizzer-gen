    "intro": "Moseleya, commonly known as the desert star, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their compact, sprawling growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Moseleya species are often found in rocky soils and are well adapted to drought conditions. They are popular in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
