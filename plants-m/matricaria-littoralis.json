    "intro": "Matricaria littoralis, commonly known as coastal chamomile, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that resemble those of true chamomile, though it belongs to a different genus. Its aromatic leaves and flowers are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine. Matricaria littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
