    "intro": "Mostuea, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zingiberaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Mostuea species typically feature showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, with a strong, spicy scent. They are often found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The leaves are usually broad and sword-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
