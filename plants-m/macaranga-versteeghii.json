It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes used for reforestation and as a source of timber."
