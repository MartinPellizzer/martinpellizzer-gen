    "intro": "Meniscium giganteum, commonly known as the giant meniscium, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, hollow stems and pinnately compound leaves with finely divided, feathery lobes. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense, spherical cluster that gives it a dramatic appearance. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often admired in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
