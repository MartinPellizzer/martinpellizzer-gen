    "intro": "Microliabum polymnioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically features small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, dry habitats such as slopes and dunes. Its botanical structure is well adapted to withstand drought and full sun exposure."
