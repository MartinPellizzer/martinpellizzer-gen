It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible tubers similar to those of the manioc plant. Botanically, it belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its latex-producing species."
