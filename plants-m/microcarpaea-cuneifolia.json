    "intro": "Microcarpaea cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microcarpaea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
