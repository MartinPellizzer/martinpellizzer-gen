    "intro": "Madangia inflata, commonly known as the inflated madangia, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like fruits that encase the seeds, a feature that aids in wind dispersal. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually large, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers are showy and often pink or purple. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in tropical gardens for its distinctive appearance and ecological interest."
