It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Myrcia triflora thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
