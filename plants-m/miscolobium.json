    "intro": "Miscolobium, commonly known as the \"garden nightshade,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. Miscolobium species are known for their fragrant flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and have a long history of use in traditional medicine."
