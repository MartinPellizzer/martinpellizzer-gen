    "intro": "Musa acuminata subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf banana plant, is a member of the Musaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, robust stems and large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by elongated, slender fruits known as bananas. It is typically cultivated for its edible fruit, which is smaller and less sweet compared to the common banana varieties. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often grown in gardens and tropical landscapes."
