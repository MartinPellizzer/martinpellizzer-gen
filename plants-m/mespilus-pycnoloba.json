    "intro": "Mespilus pycnoloba, commonly known as the woolly medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by unique, fleshy, apple-like fruits. The fruit ripens in late autumn and is known for its aromatic, sweet scent. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
