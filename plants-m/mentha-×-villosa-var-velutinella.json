    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. velutinella, commonly known as velvet mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, often woolly leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a strong, minty fragrance and is used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a serrated edge, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it establish in various soil types."
