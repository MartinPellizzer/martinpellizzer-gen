    "intro": "Mitella micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a perennial herb native to the forests of eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in shaded environments. Mitella micrantha is often found in moist, woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
