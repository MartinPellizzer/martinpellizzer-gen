    "intro": "Micranthemum orbiculatum, commonly known as water wort, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, round to oval leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its compact size and rapid growth make it a popular choice for aquariums and pond landscapes."
