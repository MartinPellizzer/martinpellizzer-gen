    "intro": "Microclisia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Microclisia is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
