    "intro": "Miconia regelii, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
