    "intro": "Metroxylon oxybracteatum, commonly known as the Borneo palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is a large, tall palm with a stout, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as roofing materials. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and wildlife. The Borneo palm plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and supporting various species."
