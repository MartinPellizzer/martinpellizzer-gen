    "intro": "Micropteryx sublobata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pygmy moth, is a small species of moth belonging to the family Micropteridae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, where it inhabits a variety of forested environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in association with specific host plants such as certain species of ferns and mosses. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
