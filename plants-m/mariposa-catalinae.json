    "intro": "Mariposa catalinae, commonly known as Catalina's mariposa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
