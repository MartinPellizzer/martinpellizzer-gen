    "intro": "Miconia alborosea, commonly known as the white-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
