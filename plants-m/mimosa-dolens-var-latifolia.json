    "intro": "Mimosa dolens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a soft, velvety texture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique reactive behavior."
