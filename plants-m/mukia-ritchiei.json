    "intro": "Mukia ritchiei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
