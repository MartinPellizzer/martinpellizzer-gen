    "intro": "Mimosa campeachiana, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can become invasive, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Mimosa campeachiana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in certain ecosystems."
