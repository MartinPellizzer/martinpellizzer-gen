    "intro": "Micropholis eugeniifolia, commonly known as the silky ash or velvet ash, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
