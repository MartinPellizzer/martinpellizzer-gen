It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to reveal several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.
