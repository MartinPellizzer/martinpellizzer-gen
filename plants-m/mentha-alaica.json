It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant has square stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are usually purple or pink and bloom in late summer. Mentha alaica is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
