    "intro": "Malaxis khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi Malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
