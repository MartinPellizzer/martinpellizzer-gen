    "intro": "Magnolia platyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its roots are typically shallow, making it adaptable to various soil types. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks. The narrow-leaved magnolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
