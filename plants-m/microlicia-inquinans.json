    "intro": "Microlicia inquinans, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in saline and tidal environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems where it plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has a distinctive dark, almost black bark, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Microlicia inquinans is adapted to withstand saltwater inundation and has specialized root systems that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils."
