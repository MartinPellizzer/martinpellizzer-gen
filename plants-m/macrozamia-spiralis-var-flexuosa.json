    "intro": "Macrozamia spiralis var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexuosa cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are often twisted or coiled. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to its restricted habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
