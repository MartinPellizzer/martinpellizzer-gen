    "intro": "Mastigophorus gaudichaudii, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to South America. It has broad, waxy leaves that float on the surface of freshwater lakes and ponds. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the mud, while its stems provide structural support for the floating leaves. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
