    "intro": "Melandrium neocaespitosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. The species is known for its ability to produce a large number of small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
