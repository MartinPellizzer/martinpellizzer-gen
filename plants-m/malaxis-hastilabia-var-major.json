    "intro": "Malaxis hastilabia var. major, commonly known as the giant malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves and elongated, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
