    "intro": "Malaxis prasina, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking pink to purple flower spikes that resemble a cascade of tiny, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, elongated green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Malaxis prasina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
