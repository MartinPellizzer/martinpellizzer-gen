It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter in color beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
