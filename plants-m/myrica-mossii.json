It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Myrica mossii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streams. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
