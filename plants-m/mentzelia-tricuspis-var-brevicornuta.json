    "intro": "Mentzelia tricuspis var. brevicornuta, commonly known as the short-horned blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its striking purple to reddish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety brevicornuta is distinguished by its shorter, more compact flower heads compared to the typical form of M. tricuspis."
