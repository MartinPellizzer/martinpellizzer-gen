    "intro": "Maihueniopsis darwinii, commonly known as the Darwin's cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its dense rosettes of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
