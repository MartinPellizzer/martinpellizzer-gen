    "intro": "Mystacidium distichum, commonly known as the two-ranked liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and closely spaced, two-ranked leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces male and female reproductive structures on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important species in studies of bryophyte ecology and evolution."
