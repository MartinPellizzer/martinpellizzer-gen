    "intro": "Motandra welwitschiana, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique and ancient plant native to Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, saccate leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Motandra welwitschiana is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
