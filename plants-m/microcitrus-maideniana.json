    "intro": "Microcitrus maideniana, commonly known as the dwarf lemon or the miniature citron, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, small citrus fruits that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible fruits with a tart, lemon-like flavor. Its leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and citrus aroma. Microcitrus maideniana is well-suited for container gardening and can thrive in warm, sunny climates."
