    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. affinis, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters during the summer months. It thrives in wet soils near streams, ponds, and marshes. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable in both traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
