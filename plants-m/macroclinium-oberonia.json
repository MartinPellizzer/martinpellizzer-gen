    "intro": "Macroclinium oberonia, commonly known as the Oberonia orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, or green. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Macroclinium oberonia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated in botanical gardens and private collections."
