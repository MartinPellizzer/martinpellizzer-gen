    "intro": "Mikania sodiroi, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
