    "intro": "Mammillaria haageana subsp. schmollii, commonly known as the Schmollii pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, white radial spines and a dense covering of small, tuberculate areoles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections."
