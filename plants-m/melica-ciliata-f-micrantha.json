    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadowgrass, is a botanical variant of the species Melica ciliata. It is a grass-like plant belonging to the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like flower clusters are usually greenish or pale blue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This form is distinguished by its narrower leaves and reduced floral structures compared to the typical form of Melica ciliata."
