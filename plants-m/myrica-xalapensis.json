    "intro": "Myrica xalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Myricaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a subtropical climate. Myrica xalapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal landscaping."
