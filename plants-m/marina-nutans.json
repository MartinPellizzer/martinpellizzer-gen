    "intro": "Marina nutans, commonly known as the drooping sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in tidal zones and along shorelines. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels makes it well adapted to maritime environments. Marina nutans is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
