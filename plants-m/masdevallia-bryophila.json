    "intro": "Masdevallia bryophila, commonly known as the mossy masdevallia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant's name refers to its association with mossy habitats, where it often grows in shaded, humid environments. It has strap-like leaves and produces a compact inflorescence with numerous tiny, fragrant blooms. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural habitat."
