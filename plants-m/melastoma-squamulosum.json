    "intro": "Melastoma squamulosum, commonly known as the squamulate melastoma, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture and a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Melastoma squamulosum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
