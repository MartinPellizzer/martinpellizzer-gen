It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting compound leaves with elongated, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by pod-like fruits containing several elliptical seeds. Its leaves are typically glabrous or nearly so, giving it a smooth appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas."
