    "intro": "Medicago suffruticosa, commonly known as goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Medicago suffruticosa has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a forage plant for livestock."
