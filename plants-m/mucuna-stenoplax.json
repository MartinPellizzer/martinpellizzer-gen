    "intro": "Mucuna stenoplax, commonly known as the narrow-leaf velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by pods containing flattened, dark brown seeds. Mucuna stenoplax is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural settings. It also contains compounds with potential medicinal properties, though its use is sometimes limited due to its toxic effects."
