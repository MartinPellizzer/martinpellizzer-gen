    "intro": "Micromeria echioides var. gasparinii, commonly known as the Gasparini's desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
