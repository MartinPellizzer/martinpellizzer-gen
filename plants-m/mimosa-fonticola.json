    "intro": "Mimosa fonticola, commonly known as the water mimosa, is a small shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or physical contact. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams or wetlands. Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
