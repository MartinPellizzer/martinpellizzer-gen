It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its small size and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
