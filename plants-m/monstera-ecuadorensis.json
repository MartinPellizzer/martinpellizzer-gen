    "intro": "Monstera ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorean monstera, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop distinctive holes and splits as they mature. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Monstera ecuadorensis requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish."
