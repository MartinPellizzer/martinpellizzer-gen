    "intro": "Melampyrum arvense var. versicolor, commonly known as yellow cow-wheat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields."
