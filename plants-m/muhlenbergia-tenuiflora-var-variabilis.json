    "intro": "Muhlenbergia tenuiflora var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-blue foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces panicles of small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
