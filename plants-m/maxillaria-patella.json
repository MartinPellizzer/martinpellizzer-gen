    "intro": "Maxillaria patella, commonly known as the small-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Maxillaria patella is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
