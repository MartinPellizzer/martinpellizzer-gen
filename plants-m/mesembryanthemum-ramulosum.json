    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum ramulosum, commonly known as the coastal mesem, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
