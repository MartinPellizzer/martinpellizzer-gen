    "intro": "Meliosma vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic meliosma, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions near active volcanoes. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs characterized by their aromatic wood and distinctive fruit structures. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as moths and beetles. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Meliosma vulcanica is considered a vulnerable species."
