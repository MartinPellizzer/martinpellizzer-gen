    "intro": "Mascarenhasia lisianthiflora var. pubescens, commonly known as the Mascarene starflower, is a rare endemic species native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky outcrops, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
