    "intro": "Marcetia gracillima, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Marcetia gracillima plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
