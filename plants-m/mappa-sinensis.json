    "intro": "Mappa sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese maples, refers to a group of deciduous trees and shrubs native to East Asia. These plants are characterized by their striking foliage, which changes color with the seasons, often displaying vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in autumn. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the trees produce small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Mappa sinensis species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are widely cultivated in gardens and urban landscapes. They thrive in temperate climates and require well-drained soil for optimal growth."
