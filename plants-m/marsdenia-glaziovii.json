It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a follicle containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
