    "intro": "Mespilus sanguinea var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-leaved medlar, is a variant of the medlar tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive green leaves, which contrast with the typical brownish foliage of the standard medlar. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that ripen in autumn. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticulture and plant taxonomy. The variety is noted for its ornamental value and potential use in breeding programs for improved fruit characteristics."
