    "intro": "Macaranga sarcocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered macaranga, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats. Its latex is milky and can be used in traditional practices, though it is not as economically significant as other members of its genus."
