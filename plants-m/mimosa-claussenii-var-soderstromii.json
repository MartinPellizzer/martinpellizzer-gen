It features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, curling shut when disturbed, a characteristic known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and adaptability to arid conditions."
