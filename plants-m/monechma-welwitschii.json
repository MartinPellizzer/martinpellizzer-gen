    "intro": "Monechma welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest living seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and a pair of large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. Its remarkable adaptation to arid environments includes a deep root system and the ability to store water in its trunk. The Welwitschia is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, with some individuals living over 2,000 years."
