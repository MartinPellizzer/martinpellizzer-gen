    "intro": "Mimosa brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant is also known for its sensitivity to touch, causing its leaves to fold when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
