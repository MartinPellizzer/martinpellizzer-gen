    "intro": "Mallotus stewardii, commonly known as the Steward's mallot, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
