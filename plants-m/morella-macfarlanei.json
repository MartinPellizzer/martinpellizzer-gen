It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in swampy or waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinct aromatic scent when crushed. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to aquatic environments."
