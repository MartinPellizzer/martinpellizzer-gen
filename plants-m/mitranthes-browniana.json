    "intro": "Mitranthes browniana, commonly known as the Brown's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as pine rocklands, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
