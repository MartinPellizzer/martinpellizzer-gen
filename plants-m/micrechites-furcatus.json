    "intro": "Micrechites furcatus, commonly known as the forked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its branched, leafless stems and tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures are simple, consisting of small, erect spikes that bear minute flowers. Micrechites furcatus is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor water environments."
