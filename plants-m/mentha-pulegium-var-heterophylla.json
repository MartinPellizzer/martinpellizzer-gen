It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves contain essential oils with strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
