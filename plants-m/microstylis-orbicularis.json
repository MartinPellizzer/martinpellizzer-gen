    "intro": "Microstylis orbicularis, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a small perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, and its flowers are small, clustered in spikelets. The plant has a compact, rounded growth habit, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Microstylis orbicularis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
