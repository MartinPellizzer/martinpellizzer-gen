It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Meriolix capillifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
