It is characterized by its aromatic, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn.

Its medicinal properties, including antiseptic and digestive benefits, have made it a valued herb throughout history."
