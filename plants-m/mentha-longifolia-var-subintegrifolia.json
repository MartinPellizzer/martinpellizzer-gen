    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the spearmint species characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. Its aromatic leaves contain high levels of menthol, giving it a strong minty scent and flavor. This variety is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its refreshing properties."
