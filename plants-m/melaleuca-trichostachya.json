    "intro": "Melaleuca trichostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in cylindrical clusters, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-green hue. Melaleuca trichostachya is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and sandy areas."
