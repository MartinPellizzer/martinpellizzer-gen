    "intro": "Monelasmum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved monelasmum, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodlands and shaded areas, preferring rich, well-drained soils. The plant has slender stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a pointed tip. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
