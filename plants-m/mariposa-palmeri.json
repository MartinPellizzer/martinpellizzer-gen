    "intro": "Mariposa palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's Mariposa, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the genus *Calochortus* in the family Portulacaceae, and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Mariposa palmeri is often found in disturbed or open habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
