    "intro": "Mappia obscura, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It possesses slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length, with a pale green coloration that helps it blend into its low-light environment. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a characteristic typical of many ferns. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to habitat destruction, Mappia obscura is considered endangered and is often found in conservation areas."
