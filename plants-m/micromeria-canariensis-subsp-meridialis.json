It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, reflecting its adaptation to the island's unique geological conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
