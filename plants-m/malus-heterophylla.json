    "intro": "Malus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often elliptical leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a small, yellowish apple that ripens in late summer. Malus heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
