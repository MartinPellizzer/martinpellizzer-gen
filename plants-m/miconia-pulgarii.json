    "intro": "Miconia pulgarii, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
