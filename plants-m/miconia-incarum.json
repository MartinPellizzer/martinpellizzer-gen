    "intro": "Miconia incarum, commonly known as the scarlet miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pink to red bracts that surround small, clustered white flowers. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
