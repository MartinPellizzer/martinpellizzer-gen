    "intro": "Macrolinum trigynum, commonly known as the three-ovary macrolinum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes three ovaries, a trait that sets it apart from many other species in the family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, pale flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Macrolinum trigynum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
