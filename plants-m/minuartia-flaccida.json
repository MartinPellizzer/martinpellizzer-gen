    "intro": "Minuartia flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Minuartia flaccida is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in cold, nutrient-poor habitats."
