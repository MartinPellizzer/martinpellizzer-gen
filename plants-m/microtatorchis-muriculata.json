    "intro": "Microtatorchis muriculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions in the Americas, particularly in warm, humid climates. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it a hardy species often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
