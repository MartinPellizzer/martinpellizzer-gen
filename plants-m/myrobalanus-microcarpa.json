    "intro": "Myrobalanus microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited chequerberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, providing food for native wildlife. Myrobalanus microcarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal soils and its ecological value."
