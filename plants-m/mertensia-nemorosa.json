It features striking clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mertensia nemorosa is an important early-season nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
