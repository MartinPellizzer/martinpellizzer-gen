    "intro": "Myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique structures called domatia, which are hollow, swollen stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants. The ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants by deterring them with their aggressive behavior. Myrmecophila species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments. Their mutualistic relationship with ants is a fascinating example of co-evolution in the plant kingdom."
