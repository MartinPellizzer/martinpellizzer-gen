    "intro": "Micranthera clusioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich reddish color, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
