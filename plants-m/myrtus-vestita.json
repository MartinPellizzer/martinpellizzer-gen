    "intro": "Myrtus vestita, commonly known as the white myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine white powdery coating, which gives the plant its common name. Small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the spring, followed by small, dark blue berries. This plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and is often used in herbal remedies and as a ornamental plant."
