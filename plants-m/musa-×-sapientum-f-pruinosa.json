    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 sapientum f. pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose banana, is a botanical variant of the common banana plant. It is characterized by its waxy, powdery coating on the leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, elongated fruits that are typically smaller than standard bananas. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage. This variety is also valued in some regions for its edible fruit, though it is less commonly consumed than other banana types."
