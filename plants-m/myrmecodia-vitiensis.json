It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, swollen, honeycomb-like stems that provide shelter for ants. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine pubescence. Myrmecodia vitiensis is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, forming a symbiotic relationship with ants that inhabit its structures."
