    "intro": "Mollugo flavescens subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy soils in coastal areas. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is typically found in dunes, beaches, and other coastal habitats where it tolerates salt spray and shifting sands. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Mollugaceae family and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
