    "intro": "Monotropa hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ghost plant, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for its nutrients. It is found in the understory of temperate forests, typically growing on the roots of trees such as hemlock and fir. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study. It is also known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions without photosynthesis."
