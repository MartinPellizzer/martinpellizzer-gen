    "intro": "Mikania fragilis var. leptodon, commonly known as the slender-stemmed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, hairy stems that can rapidly spread along the ground or climb supports. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture and a deep green color. Its flowers are small, trumpet-shaped, and often appear in clusters, blooming in shades of white to pale purple. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its rapid spread in natural and disturbed habitats."
