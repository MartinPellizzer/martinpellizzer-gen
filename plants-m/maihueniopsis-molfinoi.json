It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, green, succulent leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, thriving in rocky soils and extreme weather conditions.

Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
