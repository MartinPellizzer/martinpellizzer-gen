    "intro": "Mimosa calocephala, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Mimosa calocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
