    "intro": "Maianthemum bifolium f. unifolium, commonly known as the single-leaved false lily of the valley, is a rare variant of the common maianthemum. It is a low-growing evergreen perennial with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, broad leaf that is often shorter than the stem. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in woodland areas. This form is less common than the typical bifolium and is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts due to its unique morphology."
