    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. sphenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf field mint, is a variant of the broad-leaf field mint. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. This subspecies is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers, which are clustered in whorls along the stems."
