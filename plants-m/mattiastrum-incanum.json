    "intro": "Mattiastrum incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf or whiteleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance, and its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with climbing or trailing growth habits. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread in various environments."
