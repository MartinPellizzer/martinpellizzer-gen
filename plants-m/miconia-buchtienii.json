    "intro": "Miconia buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
