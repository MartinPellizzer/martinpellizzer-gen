    "intro": "Maxillaria johannyae, commonly known as Johanny's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its blooms are usually pale green to yellowish with contrasting purple or brown markings, making it visually distinctive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
