    "intro": "Muscari stoloniferum, commonly known as the spreading grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling small grapes. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Muscari stoloniferum is well-suited for rock gardens and woodland settings due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
