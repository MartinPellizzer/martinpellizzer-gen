    "intro": "Macradenia regnellii, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often reaching up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant has a tree-like structure with a straight, unbranched stem and broad, compound leaves that are palmately arranged. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure. Macradenia regnellii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
