    "intro": "Maranta prasina, commonly known as the Emerald Nightshade, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that often have a metallic sheen, especially under light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming at night. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maranta prasina is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
