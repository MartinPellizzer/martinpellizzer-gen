    "intro": "Melampyrum hoermannianum subsp. beckianum, commonly known as the Beck's touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in the northeastern United States."
