    "intro": "Medicago muricula, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are typically brown or black in color. Medicago muricula is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a forage crop and for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
