    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. flaccida, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin and a distinctive minty aroma. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. This variety is often used in herbal teas and as a ground cover in gardens due to its hardy nature and aromatic properties."
