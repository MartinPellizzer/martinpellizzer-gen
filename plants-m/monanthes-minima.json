    "intro": "Monanthes minima, commonly known as the dwarf monanthes, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
