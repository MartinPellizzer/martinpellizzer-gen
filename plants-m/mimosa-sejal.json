    "intro": "Mimosa sejal, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Mimosa sejal is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
