    "intro": "Monotropa nepalensis, commonly known as the ghost plant or Indian ghost plant, is a hemi-parasitic herb found in the forests of the Himalayas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often grow in clusters at the base of its stem. The plant is known for its unique ability to grow in shaded, moist environments. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing the growth of its host plants."
