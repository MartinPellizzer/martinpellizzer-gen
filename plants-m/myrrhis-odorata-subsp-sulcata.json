    "intro": "Myrrhis odorata subsp. sulcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial herb native to southern and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The essential oils found in its leaves and stems contribute to its medicinal and aromatic uses in traditional practices."
