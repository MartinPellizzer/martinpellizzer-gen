    "intro": "Mapouria cearensis, commonly known as the Cearense Mapouria, is a shrub native to the northeastern regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and shows a preference for well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds upon maturity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
