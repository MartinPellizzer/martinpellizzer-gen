    "intro": "Miconia neopectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are bright red, fleshy berries that contain numerous tiny seeds. Miconia neopectinata is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
