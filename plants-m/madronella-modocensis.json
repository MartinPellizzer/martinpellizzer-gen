    "intro": "Madronella modocensis, commonly known as Modoc madrona, is a rare and endemic species native to the Modoc Plateau in northeastern California. It is a small, shrub-like plant with woody stems and broad, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by clusters of red berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, semi-arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
