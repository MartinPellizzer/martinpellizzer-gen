    "intro": "Mondo koreanum, commonly known as the Korean mondo grass, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to Korea. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a mat-like ground cover. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage and ability to suppress weeds in shaded areas."
