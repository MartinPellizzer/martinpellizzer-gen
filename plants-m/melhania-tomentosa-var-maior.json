    "intro": "Melhania tomentosa var. maior, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It is native to Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a shade plant in tropical gardens."
