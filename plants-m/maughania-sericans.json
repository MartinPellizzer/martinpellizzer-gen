    "intro": "Maughania sericans, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are usually leathery in texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
