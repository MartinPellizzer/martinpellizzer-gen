    "intro": "Montbretia lacerata, commonly known as the flame lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, strap-like leaves and produces showy, orange-red flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to return year after year in suitable climates. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
