    "intro": "Mangifera rubropetala, commonly known as the red-petaled mango, is a rare and ornamental species within the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that contrast with its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically smaller than those of common mango varieties. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than commercial fruit production."
