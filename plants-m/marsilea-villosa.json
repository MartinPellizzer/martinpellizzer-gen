    "intro": "Marsilea villosa, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name and help in reducing water loss. Marsilea villosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
