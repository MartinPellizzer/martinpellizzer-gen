    "intro": "Maekawaea, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Maekawaea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
