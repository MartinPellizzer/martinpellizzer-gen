    "intro": "Miconia dissitiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is native to Central and South America and thrives in humid, shady environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
