    "intro": "Mutellina mutellinoides, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. The flowers bloom during the wet season, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
