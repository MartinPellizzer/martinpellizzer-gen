    "intro": "Medicago romanica var. lanata, commonly known as woolly medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, mat-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white to pale green color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are followed by cylindrical, hairy pods. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and pastures. Woolly medick is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in ecological restoration projects."
