    "intro": "Melaleuca nummularia, commonly known as the silver bottlebrush, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in spring. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a strong, resinous scent when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Melaleuca nummularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
