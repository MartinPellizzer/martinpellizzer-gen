It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in wetland ecosystems."
