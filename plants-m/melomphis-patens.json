    "intro": "Melomphis patens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis and water absorption. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
