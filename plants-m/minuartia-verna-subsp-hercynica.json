    "intro": "Minuartia verna subsp. hercynica, commonly known as the spring rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and limestone habitats in Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky substrates."
