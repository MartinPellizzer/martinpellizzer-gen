    "intro": "Miconia catalpifolia, commonly known as the catalpaleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a significant ecological concern in some areas."
