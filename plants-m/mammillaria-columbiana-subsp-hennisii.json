It features a globular stem with prominent, white spines and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a dense, woolly covering that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is typically grown as a houseplant due to its slow growth and ornamental appearance. This subspecies is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique morphology and ease of care."
