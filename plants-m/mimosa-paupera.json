    "intro": "Mimosa paupera, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces delicate pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically arranged in pairs, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Mimosa paupera thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
