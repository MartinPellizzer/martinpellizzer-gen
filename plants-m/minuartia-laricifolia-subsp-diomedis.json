It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra, rocky slopes, and open areas where it can receive ample sunlight. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and ability to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
