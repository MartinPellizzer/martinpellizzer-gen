    "intro": "Mimulus lyratus, commonly known as the \"Lyre's monkeyflower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange or yellow flowers, which are typically spurred at the back, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and meadows. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Mimulus lyratus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
