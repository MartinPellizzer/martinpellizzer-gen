    "intro": "Mammea eugenioides var. eugenioides, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has smooth, reddish bark and produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds for dispersal."
