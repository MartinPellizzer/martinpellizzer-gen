    "intro": "Myrica pubescens, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and white underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. Myrica pubescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
