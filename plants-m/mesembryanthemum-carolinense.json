    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum carolinense, commonly known as the Carolina snowball, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling snowballs, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves helps it survive in dry conditions."
