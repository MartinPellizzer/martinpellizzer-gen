It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
