    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis f. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular orbicular vetch, is a variant of the orbicular vetch, characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on the leaves and stems. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are orbicular in shape, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in soil enrichment and as a forage plant for livestock."
