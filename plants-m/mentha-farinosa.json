    "intro": "Mentha farinosa, commonly known as the meadow mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, giving it its scientific name \"farinosa,\" which means \"farinose\" or flour-like. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale blue to violet and bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentha farinosa is known for its aromatic, cool scent and is sometimes used in herbal teas or as a culinary herb."
