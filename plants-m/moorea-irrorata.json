    "intro": "Moorea irrorata, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Moorea irrorata is considered a rare and endangered species."
