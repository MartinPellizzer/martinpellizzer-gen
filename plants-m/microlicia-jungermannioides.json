    "intro": "Microlicia jungermannioides, commonly known as the Jungermannioid liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Jungermanniaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the air. The plant has a flattened, ribbon-like thallus with a distinct central strand of cells, which helps in water transport. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its thallus for nutrient and water absorption. Microlicia jungermannioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
