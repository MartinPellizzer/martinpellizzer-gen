The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by woody capsules containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. Melaleuca gilesii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
