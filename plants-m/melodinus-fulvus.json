    "intro": "Melodinus fulvus, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender stems that can climb or trail, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
