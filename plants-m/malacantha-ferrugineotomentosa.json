    "intro": "Malacantha ferrugineotomentosa, commonly known as the rusty-tomentose milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and leaves that are covered in fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but serves as a defense mechanism. This species plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
