It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open woods, roadsides, and fields. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Memora pseudopatula is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
