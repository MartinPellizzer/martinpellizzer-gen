    "intro": "Myristica umbellata, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain the aromatic seeds used for nutmeg and mace. Its botanical features include a dense canopy, smooth bark, and a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The tree is valued not only for its commercial spices but also for its ecological and medicinal significance."
