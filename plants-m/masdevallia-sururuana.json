    "intro": "Masdevallia sururuana, commonly known as the Sururuana masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flower structure, which includes elongated petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
