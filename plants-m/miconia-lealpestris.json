    "intro": "Miconia lealpestris, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits. Its foliage and fruit are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
