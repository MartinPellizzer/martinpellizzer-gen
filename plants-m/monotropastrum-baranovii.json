It is native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern China. The plant has a smooth, dark green foliage and produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat."
