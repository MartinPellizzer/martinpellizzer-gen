    "intro": "Malaxis dentata, commonly known as the toothed malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and often have a slight toothed edge, giving it its common name. Malaxis dentata is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological niche in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests."
