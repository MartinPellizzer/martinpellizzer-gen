    "intro": "Manihot subspicata, commonly known as the stilted arrowleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible tubers similar to cassava, though they are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
