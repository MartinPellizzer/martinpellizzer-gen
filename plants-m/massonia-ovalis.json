    "intro": "Massonia ovalis, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Massonia ovalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
