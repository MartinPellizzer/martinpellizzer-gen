    "intro": "Miconia rheophytica, commonly known as the stream miconia, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and riverine forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams and in swampy areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
