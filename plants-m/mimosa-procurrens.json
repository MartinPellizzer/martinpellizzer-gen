    "intro": "Mimosa procurrens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mimosa procurrens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique movement."
