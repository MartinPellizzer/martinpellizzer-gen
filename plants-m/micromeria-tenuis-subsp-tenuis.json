    "intro": "Micromeria tenuis subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf micromeria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The plant has slender, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance, which are adaptations to its harsh native habitat. The species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
