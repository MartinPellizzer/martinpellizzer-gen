    "intro": "Minuartia mediterranea var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
