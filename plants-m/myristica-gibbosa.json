    "intro": "Myristica gibbosa, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The tree produces oval-shaped fruits that contain the aromatic seeds used to make nutmeg and mace. Its bark is thick and reddish-brown, and it has a distinctive, spicy aroma due to the presence of essential oils. Myristica gibbosa is valued not only for its economic importance but also for its ecological role in tropical rainforests."
