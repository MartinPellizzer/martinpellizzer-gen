    "intro": "Miconia leatrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation make it an aggressive invasive species in many regions. Due to its ecological impact, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
