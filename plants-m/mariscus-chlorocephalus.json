    "intro": "Mariscus chlorocephalus, commonly known as the yellow-headed tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting a compact and bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mariscus chlorocephalus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
