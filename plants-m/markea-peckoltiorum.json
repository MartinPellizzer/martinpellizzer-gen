    "intro": "Markea peckoltiorum, commonly known as the Peckolt's markea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. Its growth habit is primarily shrub-like, with a compact form and dense foliage. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Markea peckoltiorum is considered a species of conservation concern."
