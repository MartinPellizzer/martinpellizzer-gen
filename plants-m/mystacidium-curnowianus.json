    "intro": "Mystacidium curnowianus, commonly known as the Curnow's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It is native to New Zealand and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and rimu. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green berries that are edible for some bird species. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by providing food for wildlife while also drawing nutrients from its host. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
