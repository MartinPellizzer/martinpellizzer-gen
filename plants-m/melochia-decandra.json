    "intro": "Melochia decandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf or stinging leaf, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
