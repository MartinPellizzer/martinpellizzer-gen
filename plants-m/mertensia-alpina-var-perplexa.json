    "intro": "Mertensia alpina var. perplexa, commonly known as the alpine bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
