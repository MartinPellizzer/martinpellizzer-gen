    "intro": "Mimosa robsonii, commonly known as the Robson's mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its soft, feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
