It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a fragrant, minty aroma. This variety is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its aromatic properties."
