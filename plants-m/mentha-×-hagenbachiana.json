It is a perennial herb characterized by its square stems and opposite, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
