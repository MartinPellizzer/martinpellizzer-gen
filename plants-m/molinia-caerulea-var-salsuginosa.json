    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. salsuginosa, commonly known as the coastal moor grass, is a variant of the common moor grass that thrives in coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often gray-green in color due to a waxy coating. This plant is adapted to salty air and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in dunes and coastal heathlands. Its flowering spikes are typically pale blue to purple, adding visual interest during the summer months. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
