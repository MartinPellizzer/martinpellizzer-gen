    "intro": "Muscari trojanum, commonly known as the Trojan musk grape, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces spherical, grape-like berries that are typically dark blue when mature. Muscari trojanum thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring bloom and unique fruiting stage."
