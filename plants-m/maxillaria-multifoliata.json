    "intro": "Maxillaria multifoliata, commonly known as the many-leaved orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its numerous, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria multifoliata is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
