    "intro": "Moraea prolongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed moraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of tubular or funnel-shaped blossoms in shades of pink, red, or purple. Moraea prolongata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long, slender stems that add vertical interest to the garden."
