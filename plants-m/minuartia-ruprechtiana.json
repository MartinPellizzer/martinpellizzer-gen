    "intro": "Minuartia ruprechtiana, commonly known as the Ruprecht's sandflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Minuartia ruprechtiana is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous areas."
