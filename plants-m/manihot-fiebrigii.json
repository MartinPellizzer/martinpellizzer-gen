    "intro": "Manihot fiebrigii, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, containing high levels of starch and used in various culinary applications. However, the plant is toxic due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals, requiring careful processing before consumption."
