    "intro": "Microchilus corniculatus, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a short flowering period during the spring. Its flowers are usually pale green to white in color, with a faint fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Microchilus corniculatus is considered a rare and endangered species."
