    "intro": "Malleola altocarinata, commonly known as the high-shouldered malleola, is a distinctive plant species characterized by its unique leaf morphology and growth habit. It typically features elongated, narrow leaves with a waxy surface, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pale green or white, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Malleola altocarinata is native to specific regions of South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
