    "intro": "Miconia henripittieri, commonly known as the Pittieri's miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, showy bracts that often resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, with glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
