    "intro": "Monilaria luckhoffii, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its dry habitat. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems. Monilaria luckhoffii is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
