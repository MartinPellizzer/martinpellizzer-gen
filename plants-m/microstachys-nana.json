    "intro": "Microstachys nana, commonly known as the dwarf stachys, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its slender stems. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
