    "intro": "Melocactus communis var. conicus, commonly known as the conical melon cactus, is a distinctive species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in the evening. Its stems are covered in sharp, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem."
