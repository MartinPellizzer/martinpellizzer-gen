    "intro": "Mephitidia foetens, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The plant has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among plants in its family."
