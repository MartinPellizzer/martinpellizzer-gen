    "intro": "Mangifera quadrifida var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled star mango, is a rare and unique variant of the star mango species. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which are the stalks connecting the leaf blade to the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible, sweet fruits with a fibrous texture. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
