    "intro": "Masdevallia purocafeana, commonly known as the Coffee Mountain masdevallia, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its intricate, delicate flowers that typically feature vibrant hues of purple and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
