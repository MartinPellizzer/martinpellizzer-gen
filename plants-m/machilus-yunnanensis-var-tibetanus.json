    "intro": "Machilus yunnanensis var. tibetanus, commonly known as the Tibetan Machilus, is a variant of the Machilus yunnanensis species native to high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its lanceolate leaves with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by ellipsoid berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations above 2,500 meters.
