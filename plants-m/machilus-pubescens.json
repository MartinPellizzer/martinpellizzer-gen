    "intro": "Machilus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed. The leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, which give the plant its common name."
