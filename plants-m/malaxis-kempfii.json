    "intro": "Malaxis kempfii, commonly known as the Kempf's malaxis, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. Malaxis kempfii is valued in horticulture for its unique floral appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
