    "intro": "Misopates salvagense, commonly known as the salvaged mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It possesses small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Misopates salvagense is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
