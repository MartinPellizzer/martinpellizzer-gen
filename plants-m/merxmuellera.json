    "intro": "Merxmuellera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. Merxmuellera species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some may grow as shrubs. The flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and are often pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
