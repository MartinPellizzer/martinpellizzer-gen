    "intro": "Miconia decurrens, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
