    "intro": "Metaporana parvifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved metaporana, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
