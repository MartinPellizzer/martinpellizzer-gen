    "intro": "Minuartia recurva subsp. juressi, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments where it tolerates harsh climatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude environments and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
