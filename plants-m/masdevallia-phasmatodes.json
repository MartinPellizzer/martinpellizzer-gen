    "intro": "Masdevallia phasmatodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, pendulous stems and elongated, leathery leaves that resemble the appearance of a ghostly figure. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often hidden among its foliage, making it difficult to spot. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and specific temperature conditions. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species."
