    "intro": "Mariscus durus, commonly known as the hardy marsh mallow, is a perennial herb native to moist, temperate regions. It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mariscus durus thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
