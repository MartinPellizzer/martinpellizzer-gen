    "intro": "Maianthemum scilloideum, commonly known as the nodding lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. It is often found in association with other woodland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
