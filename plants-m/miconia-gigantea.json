    "intro": "Miconia gigantea, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia gigantea is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its ecological impact is significant due to its ability to outcompete native flora."
