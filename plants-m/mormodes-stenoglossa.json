    "intro": "Mormodes stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new shoot from a basal node. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette. The orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth."
