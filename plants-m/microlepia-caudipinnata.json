    "intro": "Microlepia caudipinnata, commonly known as the long-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance."
