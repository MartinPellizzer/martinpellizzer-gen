    "intro": "Melodorum kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu melastome, is a flowering plant native to the montane regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are elliptical with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species found primarily on Mount Kinabalu."
