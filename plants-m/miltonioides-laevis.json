    "intro": "Miltonioides laevis, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale, ghostly white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faint greenish tint. The plant has a unique structure, with long, thin roots that grow along the surface of the substrate rather than underground. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
