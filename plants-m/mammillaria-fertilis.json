It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
