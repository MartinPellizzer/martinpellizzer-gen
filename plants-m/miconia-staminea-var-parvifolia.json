    "intro": "Miconia staminea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with showy bracts that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a mild, acidic flavor. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
