It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, tubular shape. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in moist, rocky soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Malaxis ventilabrum is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves specific insect species."
