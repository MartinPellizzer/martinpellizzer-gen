    "intro": "Merkusia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf merkusia, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
