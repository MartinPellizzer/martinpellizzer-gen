    "intro": "Microstylis chlorophrys, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a small perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Microstylis chlorophrys is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Its delicate appearance and ecological significance make it an important species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
