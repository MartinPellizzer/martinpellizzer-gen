    "intro": "Medicago cuneata, commonly known as narrowleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, disturbed soils. It is often found in prairies, roadsides, and sandy soils due to its adaptability. Medicago cuneata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
