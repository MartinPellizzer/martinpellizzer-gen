    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum canum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Mesembryanthemum canum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
