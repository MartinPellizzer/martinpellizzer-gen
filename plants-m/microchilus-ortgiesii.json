    "intro": "Microchilus ortgiesii, commonly known as the Ortgies' orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
