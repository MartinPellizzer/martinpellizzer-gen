It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered in soft, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
