    "intro": "Mimosa velutina, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, compound leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility. Mimosa velutina is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
