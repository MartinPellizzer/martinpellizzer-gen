It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is typically covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
