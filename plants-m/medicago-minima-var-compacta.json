    "intro": "Medicago minima var. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils due to its adaptability. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental gardens and as a ground cover."
