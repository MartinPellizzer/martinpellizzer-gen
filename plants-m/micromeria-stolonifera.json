    "intro": "Micromeria stolonifera, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Micromeria stolonifera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal sage scrub and desert habitats."
