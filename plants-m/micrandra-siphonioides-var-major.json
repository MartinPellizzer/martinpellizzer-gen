    "intro": "Micrandra siphonioides var. major, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It has feathery, delicate fronds that are typically submerged, though some may extend above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
