    "intro": "Mastixia kimanilla var. caesia, commonly known as the Kima\u00f1a mastix tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to East Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often glandular leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and leaves contain latex, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
