    "intro": "Metrosideros polymorpha var. newellii, commonly known as the Koa 'Newellii' or Newell's Koa, is a variant of the native Hawaiian koa tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve moisture in its native arid environments. This variety is often found in upland and dry forest habitats across the Hawaiian Islands. It plays a significant ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native range."
