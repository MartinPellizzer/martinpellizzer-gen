    "intro": "Mercurialis reverchonii var. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated mercury plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that often grow from the base, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
