    "intro": "Mirabilis triandria, commonly known as the triandrous four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant produces three distinct types of flowers on the same inflorescence: male, female, and hermaphroditic, which is a unique reproductive feature. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
