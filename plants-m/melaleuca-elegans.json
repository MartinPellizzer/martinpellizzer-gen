    "intro": "Melaleuca elegans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, revealing a pale, papery texture beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. Melaleuca elegans is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air."
