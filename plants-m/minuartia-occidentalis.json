    "intro": "Minuartia occidentalis, commonly known as the western sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Minuartia occidentalis is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy species in ecological restoration projects."
