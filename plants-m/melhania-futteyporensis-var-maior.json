    "intro": "Melhania futteyporensis var. maior, commonly known as the Greater Futtley's Melhania, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Melhania genus, which is part of the Malvaceae family, known for its showy flowers and fibrous plants. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
