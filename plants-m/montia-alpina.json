    "intro": "Montia alpina, commonly known as the alpine monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Montia alpina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
