    "intro": "Mutisia lanigera, commonly known as the wooly mutisia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Mutisia lanigera is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
