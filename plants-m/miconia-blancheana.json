    "intro": "Miconia blancheana, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
