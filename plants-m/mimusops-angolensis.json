    "intro": "Mimusops angolensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and tool handles, and for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
