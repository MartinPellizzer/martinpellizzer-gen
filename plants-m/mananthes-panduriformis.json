It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, pod-like structures that split open when mature to disperse the seeds. Mananthes panduriformis is often found in moist, shaded environments within rainforests."
