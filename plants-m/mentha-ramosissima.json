    "intro": "Mentha ramosissima, commonly known as Siberian mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong minty scent and various medicinal uses. Mentha ramosissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of natural flavoring."
