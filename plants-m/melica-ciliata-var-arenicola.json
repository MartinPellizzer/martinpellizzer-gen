    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with ciliate margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils, it plays a role in ecological restoration efforts."
