    "intro": "Mecardonia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate mecardonia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters and features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are usually arranged alternately along the stems. Mecardonia procumbens is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xerophytic gardens."
