    "intro": "Mimosa nuda var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant characterized by its reduced hair coverage on the stems and leaves. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is native to certain regions of South America. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed. Its small, yellow, pea-like flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
