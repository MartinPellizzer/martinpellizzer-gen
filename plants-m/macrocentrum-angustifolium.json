    "intro": "Macrocentrum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved macrocentrum, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
