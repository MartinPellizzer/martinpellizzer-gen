It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. Its flowers are characterized by their spurred petals and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Mimulus parvulus is often found in disturbed habitats and is a common sight in areas with adequate water availability."
