    "intro": "Myroxylon buxifolium, commonly known as the wax tree or bulletwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and the production of a heavy, waxy resin that has been historically harvested for its industrial uses. The plant's leaves are elliptical and leathery, while its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is well adapted to humid, tropical climates. Its botanical significance lies in both its ecological role and its historical economic importance."
