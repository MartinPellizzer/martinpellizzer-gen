    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha var. callaena, commonly known as the Callaena mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with a white, waxy coating and is covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
