    "intro": "Mendoncia velloziana var. sphingeria, commonly known as the velvetleaf mendoncia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
