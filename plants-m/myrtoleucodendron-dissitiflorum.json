    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron dissitiflorum, commonly known as the silver-leafed myrtle, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its leathery, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
