    "intro": "Micropsis spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and its intricate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Its root system is specialized for absorbing nutrients from poor, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Micropsis spathulata is considered a vulnerable species."
