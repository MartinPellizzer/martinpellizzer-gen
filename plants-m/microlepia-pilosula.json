    "intro": "Microlepia pilosula, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. The fronds are pinnate, with lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its elegant, fern-like structure."
