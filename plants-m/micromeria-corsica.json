    "intro": "Micromeria corsica, commonly known as the Corsican micromeria, is a small, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
