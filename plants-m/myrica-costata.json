    "intro": "Myrica costata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrica costata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
