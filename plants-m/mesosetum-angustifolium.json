The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its botanical features make it a key component of wetland ecosystems in its native range."
