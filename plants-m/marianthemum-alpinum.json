    "intro": "Marianthemum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Marianthemum alpinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
