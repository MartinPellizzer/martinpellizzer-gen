It consists of about 15 species, most of which are herbaceous annuals or biennials. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble small lanterns. They typically have alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produce capsules as fruits. Melandrium species are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and some are cultivated for their ornamental value."
