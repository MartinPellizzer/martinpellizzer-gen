    "intro": "Megalastrum leptosorum, commonly known as the slender-leaved megalastrum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a compact form that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
