    "intro": "Macromeria pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's macromeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
