It is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits and distinctive seed structure. The plant produces large, fleshy berries that contain a single, heavy, aromatic seed. The seed, known as a nutmeg, is enclosed in a hard, reddish-brown shell and is highly valued for its spice. This species is closely related to the commercial nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans, and shares similar botanical features."
