    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata var. echinata, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded stem covered in small, tubercles that bear short, spiny glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
