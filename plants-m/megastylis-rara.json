    "intro": "Megastylis rara, commonly known as the rare star-stemmed orchid, is a delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink and white. The plant's most distinctive feature is its elongated, star-shaped petals, which are adorned with intricate veining patterns. Megastylis rara thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
