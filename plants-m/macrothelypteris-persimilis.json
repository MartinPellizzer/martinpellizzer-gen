    "intro": "Macrothelypteris persimilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant has a distinctive, simple leaf structure with a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil."
