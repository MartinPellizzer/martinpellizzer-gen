    "intro": "Magnolia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-textured magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it its common name, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
