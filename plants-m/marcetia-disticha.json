    "intro": "Marcetia disticha, commonly known as the two-branched marsh plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Marcetia disticha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
