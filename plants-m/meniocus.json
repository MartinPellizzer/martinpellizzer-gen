    "intro": "Meniocus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by triangular, woody fruits containing seeds. It is native to the Americas and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
