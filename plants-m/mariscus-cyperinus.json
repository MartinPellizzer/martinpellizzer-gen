    "intro": "Mariscus cyperinus, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and small, clustered flowers. Native to wetland and marshy environments, it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat."
