    "intro": "Matteuccia, commonly known as ostrich fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a distinctive, upright, fiddlehead-like frond that unfurls into a compound structure with multiple smaller leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the young fronds are edible when cooked. Matteuccia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
