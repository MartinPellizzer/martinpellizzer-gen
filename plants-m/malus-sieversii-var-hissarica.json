    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. hissarica, commonly known as the Central Asian apple, is a wild species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red or yellow fruits that are typically smaller than cultivated apples. It is valued for its genetic diversity and is considered an important ancestor in the development of many modern apple cultivars. This variety is also noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
