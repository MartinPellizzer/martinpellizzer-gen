    "intro": "Miconia biformis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
