    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. amaurophylla, commonly known as the purple mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and leaves that range from gray-green to purple in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its aromatic leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
