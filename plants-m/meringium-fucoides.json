    "intro": "Meringium fucoides, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that thrives in marine environments. It forms dense, gelatinous mats on rocky substrates in coastal areas. The plant has a simple structure composed of flat, blade-like thallus that floats or adheres to surfaces. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, often releasing spores into the water. Meringium fucoides plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
