    "intro": "Manfreda umbrophila, commonly known as the swamp manfreda, is a unique succulent native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
