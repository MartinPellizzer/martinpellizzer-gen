It is characterized by its striking tri-colored petals, typically displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, pseudobulb-like structures that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size and are arranged in a raceme, adding to its ornamental appeal. Masdevallia tricolor thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth."
