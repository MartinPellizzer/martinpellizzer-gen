    "intro": "Malaxis chica, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, hair-like leaves that form a rosette, and its flowering spike that bears small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a loose, cascading pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hammocks, often growing on the forest floor. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Malaxis chica is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
