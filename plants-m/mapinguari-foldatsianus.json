    "intro": "Mapinguari foldatsianus, commonly known as the Moonlight Fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow during the night, a trait attributed to specialized chloroplasts containing unique photophores. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often found near waterfalls or in dense cloud forests. Its roots are known to absorb trace minerals from the soil, contributing to its unusual coloration. Despite its beauty, it remains poorly studied due to its elusive nature and limited geographic distribution."
