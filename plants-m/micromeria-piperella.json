It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Micromeria piperella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
