    "intro": "Manihot tripartita subsp. laciniosa, commonly known as the creeping arrowleaf manioc, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with deeply lobed, laciniate margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed or secondary forest habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for its starchy roots, though it is less commonly used than other manioc species."
