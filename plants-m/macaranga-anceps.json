    "intro": "Macaranga anceps, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, palmate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed environments. Macaranga anceps is also valued for its latex, which has been used historically for rubber production."
