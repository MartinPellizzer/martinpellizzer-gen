    "intro": "Miconia metallica, commonly known as the silver miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
