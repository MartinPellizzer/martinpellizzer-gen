    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense subsp. hians, commonly known as the greater yellow toadflax, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. Its roots are parasitic, relying on the roots of other plants for nutrients, which is a common trait among members of its family. The subspecies hians is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of Melampyrum pratense."
