    "intro": "Miconia leaovata, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
