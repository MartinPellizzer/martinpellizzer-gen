    "intro": "Milium gallecicum, commonly known as the Galician millet, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, dry fruits known as caryopses. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
