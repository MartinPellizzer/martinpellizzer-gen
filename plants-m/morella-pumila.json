    "intro": "Morella pumila, commonly known as the dwarf waxnut, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in wet, boggy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by hard, waxy fruits containing sweet, edible seeds. Morella pumila is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
