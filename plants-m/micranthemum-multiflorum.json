    "intro": "Micranthemum multiflorum, commonly known as water thyme, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has tiny, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, and it produces numerous small, white flowers throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. It is frequently used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. Additionally, it plays a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and reducing algae growth."
