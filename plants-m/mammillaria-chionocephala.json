    "intro": "Mammillaria chionocephala, commonly known as the white-headed hedgehog cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly spines that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
