    "intro": "Mayanaea caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed mayanaea, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its unique morphology. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with a rosette of elongated, lance-shaped leaves that often have a bluish-green hue. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in terminal inflorescences, and it produces edible, coconut-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mayanaea caudata is considered a species of conservation concern."
