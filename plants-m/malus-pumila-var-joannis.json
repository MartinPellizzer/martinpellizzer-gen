    "intro": "Malus pumila var. joannis, commonly known as the Joannis crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, smooth bark, and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring. The tree produces small, sour fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are used in jams and preserves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
