    "intro": "Miconia klotzschii, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with red bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
