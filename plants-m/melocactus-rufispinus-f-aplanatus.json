    "intro": "Melocactus rufispinus f. aplanatus, commonly known as the flat-spined melocactus, is a rare and unique variant of the melocactus genus. It is characterized by its short, broad, and flat spines, which distinguish it from the typical spiny form of its parent species. The plant has a globular to cylindrical shape with a dark green to reddish-brown stem that often develops a reddish tinge under bright light. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts and conservationists."
