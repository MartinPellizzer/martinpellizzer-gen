    "intro": "Microlicia martialis, commonly known as the Amazonian fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks and branches of trees. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures, which aid in moisture retention. Microlicia martialis plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
