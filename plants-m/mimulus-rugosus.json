    "intro": "Mimulus rugosus, commonly known as the rough monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to western North America. It features striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland areas. Its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it often forms dense colonies in suitable habitats. Mimulus rugosus is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
