    "intro": "Marmoritis nivalis, commonly known as the snow marble plant, is a rare alpine species characterized by its striking white and green mottled leaves. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, moist conditions, typically found in mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. The plant's leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help insulate it from freezing temperatures. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in early spring. Due to its specialized habitat, Marmoritis nivalis is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
