    "intro": "Medicago minima subsp. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined medick, is a low-growing perennial forage plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types but thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects."
