    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. radicans, commonly known as the trailing water violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions. This variant is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade."
