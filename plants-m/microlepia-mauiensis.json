    "intro": "Microlepia mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's shield fern, is a rare fern species endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori that are clustered along the veins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
