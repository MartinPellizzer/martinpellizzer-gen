    "intro": "Machaerium arboreum, commonly known as the tree legume or broadleaf senna, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein in some cultures. The plant also plays a role in soil enrichment and habitat provision in its native ecosystems."
