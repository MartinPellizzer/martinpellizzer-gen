    "intro": "Miconia rimbachii, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into fleshy, star-shaped fruits, which are edible and have a tangy flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
