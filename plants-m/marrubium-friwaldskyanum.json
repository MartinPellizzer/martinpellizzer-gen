    "intro": "Marrubium friwaldskyanum, commonly known as the Friwaldskyanum hartschaum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the plantain family, Plantaginaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
