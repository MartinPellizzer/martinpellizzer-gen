    "intro": "Mimosa gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. It produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. Mimosa gentryi is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules, making it an important plant in ecological contexts."
