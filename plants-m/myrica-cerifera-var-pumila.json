    "intro": "Myrica cerifera var. pumila, commonly known as dwarf wax myrtle, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use as a screening plant or in xeriscaping."
