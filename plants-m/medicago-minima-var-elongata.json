    "intro": "Medicago minima var. elongata, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
