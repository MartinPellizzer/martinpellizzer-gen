    "intro": "Maianthemum japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese false lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 cm, featuring grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from red to black, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and forest understories. Its foliage and floral structure are similar to that of the true lily of the valley, but it lacks the strong fragrance associated with that species."
