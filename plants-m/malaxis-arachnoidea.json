    "intro": "Malaxis arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that often grows in dense clusters. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
