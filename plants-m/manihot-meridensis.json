    "intro": "Manihot meridensis, commonly known as the mountain cassava, is a shrub native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and smooth, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots, while not as widely cultivated as other cassava varieties, are sometimes used for their starchy content. Manihot meridensis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments, making it a resilient species in arid regions."
