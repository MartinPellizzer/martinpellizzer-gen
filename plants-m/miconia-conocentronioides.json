    "intro": "Miconia conocentronioides, commonly known as the purple miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are often followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a common ornamental species in tropical gardens. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
