    "intro": "Microchilus boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian microchilus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
