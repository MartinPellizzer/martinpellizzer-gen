    "intro": "Mirabilis pseudaggregata var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often blooming at night. It belongs to the Nyctaginaceae family and is known for its short flowering period. The glandular structures on its foliage also contribute to its ability to deter herbivores."
