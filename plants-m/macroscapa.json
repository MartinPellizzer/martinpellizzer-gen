These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiky bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. They are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. Macroscapa species often have succulent leaves and stems, which help them retain moisture. Their unique appearance makes them popular in horticulture, though they require well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
