It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of its distinctive, aromatic nuts. The plant is typically found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fruits are encased in a hard, woody shell and contain a richly aromatic kernel used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. This subspecies is notable for its unique chemical composition, which includes essential oils and compounds responsible for its characteristic scent and medicinal properties."
