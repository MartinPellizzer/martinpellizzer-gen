It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are often covered in fine hairs. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
