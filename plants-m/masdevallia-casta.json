    "intro": "Masdevallia casta, commonly known as the Casta Masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flower structure with a unique, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Masdevallia casta is appreciated by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
