    "intro": "Marina victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's sea holly, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from December to February. The plant has silvery, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Marina victoriae is considered a vulnerable species."
