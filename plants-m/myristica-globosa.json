    "intro": "Myristica globosa, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits. The plant is notable for its dual-purpose seeds, with the outer covering yielding mace and the inner kernel producing nutmeg. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight. Myristica globosa is also valued for its aromatic oils and has been historically significant in global trade."
