It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Monarda comata is often found in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
