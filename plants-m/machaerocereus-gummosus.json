    "intro": "Machaerocereus gummosus, commonly known as the gummosus cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant also has a distinctive, sticky resin that oozes from its stems, giving it its common name."
