    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri var. streblocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peppermint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are borne on erect flowering stems. Its aromatic leaves contain high levels of menthol, giving it a strong, cooling fragrance. This variety is valued for its use in herbal teas, aromatherapy, and as a natural insect repellent."
