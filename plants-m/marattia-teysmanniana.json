    "intro": "Marattia teysmanniana, commonly known as the Teymann's fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Marattia teysmanniana is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
