It is characterized by its fuzzy, woolly leaves and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton. Malvastrum retusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
