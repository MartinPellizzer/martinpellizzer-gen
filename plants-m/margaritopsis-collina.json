    "intro": "Margaritopsis collina, commonly known as the coastal margaritopsis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Margaritopsis collina is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dune soils."
