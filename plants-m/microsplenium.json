    "intro": "Microsplenium, commonly known as the \"spleenwort,\" is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Microsplenium has simple, linear leaves with a distinct midrib and lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, releasing spores for propagation."
