    "intro": "Mertensia alpina var. humilis, commonly known as the alpine bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
