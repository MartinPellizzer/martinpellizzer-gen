    "intro": "Mammillaria sphacelata subsp. viperina, commonly known as the viper's head cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem covered with white to pale blue spines and a dense coating of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
