    "intro": "Monteiroa glomerata, commonly known as the clustered monteiroa, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Monteiroa glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
