    "intro": "Malaxis negrosiana, commonly known as the Negros ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
