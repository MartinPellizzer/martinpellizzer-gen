    "intro": "Marcetia denudata, commonly known as the naked leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique morphology. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant is distinguished by its reduced, often scale-like leaves, which give it its common name. Its fronds are typically short and clustered, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other fern species. Marcetia denudata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in its natural habitat."
