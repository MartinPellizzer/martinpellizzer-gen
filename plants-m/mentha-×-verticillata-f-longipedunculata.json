    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. longipedunculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, aromatic leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in consistently damp conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong menthol scent, which contributes to its medicinal and culinary uses. This variety is a hybrid between Mentha verticillata and other Mentha species, showcasing genetic diversity within the mint family."
