    "intro": "Menyanthes trachysperma, commonly known as marsh sandwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and bog environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
