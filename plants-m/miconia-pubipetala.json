It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia pubipetala is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
