    "intro": "Monilaria, commonly known as the false morel, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Gyromitraceae. These fungi are characterized by their distinctive, irregularly shaped caps that often resemble a brain or a sponge. They are typically found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood or soil. Monilaria species are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants. However, some species, like Gyromitra esculenta, are toxic and should not be consumed."
