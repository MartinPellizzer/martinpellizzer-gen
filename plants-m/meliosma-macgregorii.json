    "intro": "Meliosma macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China. It belongs to the family Meliosmaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is highly aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of citrus or mint, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
