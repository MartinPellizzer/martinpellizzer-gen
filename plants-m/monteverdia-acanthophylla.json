It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are thick and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
