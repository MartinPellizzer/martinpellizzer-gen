    "intro": "Menispermum carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina arrowroot, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It produces striking, waxy, yellowish-green leaves that are heart-shaped and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant's flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its roots are tuberous and have been historically used for their starchy properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in the understory of forests."
