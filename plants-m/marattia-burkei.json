    "intro": "Marattia burkei, commonly known as the Burkes' marattia, is a rare fern species native to the eastern rainforests of Australia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, thick rhizome system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sporangia. Due to habitat loss, Marattia burkei is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
