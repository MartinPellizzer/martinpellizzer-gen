    "intro": "Moneses, commonly known as ghostflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. They are native to North America and are often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas. Moneses species are typically evergreen shrubs with needle-like leaves and produce berries that are edible for some bird species. The genus is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
