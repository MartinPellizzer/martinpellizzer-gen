    "intro": "Manihot violacea subsp. jacobinensis, commonly known as Jacobin's arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that produces edible tubers, which are rich in starch and used as a food source. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually pale green to purple, clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its ornamental value as well as its nutritional significance. This subspecies is closely related to other Manihot species, which are important in both traditional and modern agriculture."
