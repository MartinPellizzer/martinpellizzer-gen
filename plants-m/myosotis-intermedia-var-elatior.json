    "intro": "Myosotis intermedia var. elatior, commonly known as the Alpine forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate blue to violet flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the top of slender stems. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more elongated and lanceolate. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical name reflects its intermediate characteristics between the species Myosotis intermedia and the taller Myosotis elatior."
