    "intro": "Medica incana, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing solanine and other alkaloids. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Medica incana is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
