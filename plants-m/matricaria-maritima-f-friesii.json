    "intro": "Matricaria maritima f. friesii, commonly known as the Friesii form of the coastal chamomile, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to coastal regions of Europe. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in tiny hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that resemble daisies, with white ray florets surrounding a central disk. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in maritime climates. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds."
