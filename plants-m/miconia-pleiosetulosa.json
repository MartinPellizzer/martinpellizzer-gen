    "intro": "Miconia pleiosetulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by distinctive, star-shaped fruits. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
