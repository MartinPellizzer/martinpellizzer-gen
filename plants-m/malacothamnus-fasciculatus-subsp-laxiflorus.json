It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance.
