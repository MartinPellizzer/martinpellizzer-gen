    "intro": "Mespilus pyrifolia, commonly known as the white medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The fruit, which is typically pear-shaped and turns from green to yellowish when ripe, is edible but often has a strong, fermented flavor. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for centuries for both its fruit and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
