    "intro": "Mahonia japonica var. bealei, commonly known as Beale's Mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features compound leaves with spiny margins and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
