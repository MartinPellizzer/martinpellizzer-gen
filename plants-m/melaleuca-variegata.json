    "intro": "Melaleuca variegata, commonly known as the variegated paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous underlayer, often with a distinctive variegated pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-green hue with white or silver markings. Melaleuca variegata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub environments."
