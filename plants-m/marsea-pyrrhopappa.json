    "intro": "Marsea pyrrhopappa, commonly known as the red-leaf marsea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking red foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Marsea pyrrhopappa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
