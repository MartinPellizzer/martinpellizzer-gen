    "intro": "Mikania conferta, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a vigorous vine that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners and seeds. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants in certain regions."
