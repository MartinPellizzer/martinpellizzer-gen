    "intro": "Mycetia scortechinii, commonly known as the Indian velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. Mycetia scortechinii also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
