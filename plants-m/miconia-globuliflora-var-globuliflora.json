The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often borne in dense, globular inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Miconia globuliflora var. globuliflora is known for its rapid growth and is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
