    "intro": "Millingtonia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich, reddish-brown color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
