    "intro": "Macaglia subincana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or creeping vine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its stems are prostrate and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable environments. Macaglia subincana is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
