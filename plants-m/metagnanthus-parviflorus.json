It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant often grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
