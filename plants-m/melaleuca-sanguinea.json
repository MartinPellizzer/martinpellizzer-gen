    "intro": "Melaleuca sanguinea, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
