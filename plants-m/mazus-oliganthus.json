    "intro": "Mazus oliganthus, commonly known as the small-flower mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth habit with small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mazus oliganthus is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to stabilize soil in shaded areas."
