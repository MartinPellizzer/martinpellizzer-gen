    "intro": "Mollugo schrankii, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Mollugo schrankii is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through self-seeding, making it a common weed in gardens and fields."
