    "intro": "Microlepia flaccida, commonly known as the drooping sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often droop gracefully. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread easily. The fronds are usually dark green and have a soft, leathery texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
