    "intro": "Micromeria \u00d7 nogalesii, commonly known as the hybrid desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Micromeria cuneata and Micromeria lasianthoides. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh desert conditions."
