    "intro": "Mimosa oedoclada, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa oedoclada is often grown as a ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ease of care."
