    "intro": "Miconia dependens, commonly known as the hanging miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Miconia dependens is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
