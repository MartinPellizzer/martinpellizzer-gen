    "intro": "Meniscium palustre, commonly known as swamp meniscium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, bearing small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in loose clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment. Meniscium palustre plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
