    "intro": "Melaleuca psammophila, commonly known as the sandpaper melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or cream flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it a hardy species in coastal regions. Melaleuca psammophila plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
