    "intro": "Merremia wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some areas."
