    "intro": "Macleania penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging flower or pendulous flower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly in countries like Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its drooping inflorescences, which consist of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Macleania penduliflora thrives in cool, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
