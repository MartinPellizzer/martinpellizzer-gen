    "intro": "Microlepia crenata, commonly known as the notched water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Microlepia crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
