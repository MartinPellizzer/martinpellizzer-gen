    "intro": "Maba guineensis, commonly known as African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that give way to round, woody fruits containing a nutritious seed kernel. The seed kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products. It also plays an important role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
