    "intro": "Mallotus oppositifolius f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy oppositifolius mallotus, is a variant of the Mallotus oppositifolius species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical drupes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage and structural form."
