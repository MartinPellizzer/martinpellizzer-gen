    "intro": "Mauritiella macroclada, commonly known as the giant palm, is a striking plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a large, tree-like palm that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered fruits, each containing a single seed. Its leaves are long and have a fibrous texture, making them useful for thatching and other traditional applications. The species is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils along the shorelines of the islands."
