    "intro": "Microterangis coursiana, commonly known as the Coursian's microterangis, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red or orange berries. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Microterangis coursiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
