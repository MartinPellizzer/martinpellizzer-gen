    "intro": "Mecardonia procumbens var. herniarioides, commonly known as the creeping mecardonia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to certain regions of Europe. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy surface, and are often arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or grassy habitats."
