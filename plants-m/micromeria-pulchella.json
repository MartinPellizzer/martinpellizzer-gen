    "intro": "Micromeria pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful micromeria, is a small, flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Micromeria pulchella is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
