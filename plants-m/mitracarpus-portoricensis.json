    "intro": "Mitracarpus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is known for its hard, dense wood, which is resistant to decay and has been historically used by indigenous peoples. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
