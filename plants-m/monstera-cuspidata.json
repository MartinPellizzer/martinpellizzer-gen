    "intro": "Monstera cuspidata, commonly known as the Split-leaf Philodendron, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop deep, irregular splits as the plant matures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage is often variegated with light yellow or white markings, adding visual interest. Monstera cuspidata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
