It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
