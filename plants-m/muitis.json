    "intro": "Muitis, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots that help in anchoring it to muddy substrates and in gas exchange. Its leaves are typically thin and waxy, aiding in reducing water loss. Muitis plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
