    "intro": "Marianthus paralius, commonly known as the coastal marianthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical coastal regions. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or saline soils, adapting well to coastal environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Marianthus paralius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
