    "intro": "Mitracarpus frigidus var. discolor, commonly known as the frosty mitracarpus, is a rare and frost-sensitive plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its varietal name, discolor, refers to the distinctive color variation in its foliage, which can range from silver-green to bluish-gray. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
