It features trifoliate leaves with rounded leaflets, and its stems are often hairy and branched. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature."
