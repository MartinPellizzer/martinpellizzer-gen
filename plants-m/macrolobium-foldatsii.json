    "intro": "Macrolobium foldatsii, commonly known as the Foldats' giant lobed plant, is a unique species native to the humid lowland forests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a waxy texture and a deep green color. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom during the wet season. It has a robust root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-rich, moist soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
