    "intro": "Mallotus muricatus var. walkerae, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing hard, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill forests. Due to its slow growth and durable wood, it is valued for both ecological and commercial purposes."
