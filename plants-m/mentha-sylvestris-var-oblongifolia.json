    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Mentha sylvestris. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive minty fragrance."
