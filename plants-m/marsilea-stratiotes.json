    "intro": "Marsilea stratiotes, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating, four-leaf clover-like structure, which consists of four small, heart-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish flowers that develop into fruiting bodies containing minute seeds. Marsilea stratiotes plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for aquatic animals."
