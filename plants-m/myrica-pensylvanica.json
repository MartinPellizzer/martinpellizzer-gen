    "intro": "Myrica pensylvanica, commonly known as sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in catkins, followed by spiky, spherical fruit clusters that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Myrica pensylvanica is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and disturbed sites across its native range."
