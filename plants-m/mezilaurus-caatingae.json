It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and pinnate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Mezilaurus caatingae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
