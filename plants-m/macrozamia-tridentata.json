    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata, commonly known as the Southern cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system to access water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
