    "intro": "Mygalurus caudatus, commonly known as the hairy-tailed mygalomorph, is a unique species of spider belonging to the family Mygalidae. It is characterized by its robust body and distinctive, hairy tail-like appendage at the end of its abdomen. This spider is primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in rocky or sandy habitats. Its exoskeleton is typically a muted brown or reddish color, providing effective camouflage in its natural environment. The plant aspect is not applicable, as Mygalurus caudatus is an animal, not a plant."
