    "intro": "Manilkara gonavensis, commonly known as the Gonave mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Gon\u00e2ve in Haiti. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces a heavy, aromatic fruit with a thick, inedible outer layer and a fleshy, sweet inner pulp. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional carpentry and furniture making."
