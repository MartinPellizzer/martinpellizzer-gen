    "intro": "Microrhynchus nudicaulis var. divaricatus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
