    "intro": "Myosotis palustris subsp. nemorosa, commonly known as the forest forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of small, blue to violet flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
