    "intro": "Morus latifolia, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green on the upper surface and pale white underneath. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits called syconia, which are often consumed by silkworms. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its leaves, which are used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to various soil types."
