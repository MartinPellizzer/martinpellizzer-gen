    "intro": "Morus mollis, commonly known as the softleaf mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green underneath. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called mulberries, which are edible and often consumed by both humans and wildlife. Morus mollis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
