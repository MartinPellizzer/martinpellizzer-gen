    "intro": "Myrtus klossii var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the Kloss's myrtle, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Sardinia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in Mediterranean climate conditions. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and emit a subtle myrtle scent, while its flowers are white or pale pink. This variety is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to other Myrtus species, contributing to its unique botanical identity."
