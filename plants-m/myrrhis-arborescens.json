    "intro": "Myrrhis arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like sweet grass, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, woody stem that resembles a small tree, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in whorls around the stem. Myrrhis arborescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
