    "intro": "Microlepia glabra, commonly known as the smooth microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has simple, entire leaves with a smooth, glossy surface, and its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Microlepia glabra is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
