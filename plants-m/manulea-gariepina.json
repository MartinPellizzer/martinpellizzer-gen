It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Manulea gariepina is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
