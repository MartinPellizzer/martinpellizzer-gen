    "intro": "Magnolia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry magnolia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features broad, glossy leaves and a woody stem, typical of the Magnoliaceae family. It is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered an endangered species."
