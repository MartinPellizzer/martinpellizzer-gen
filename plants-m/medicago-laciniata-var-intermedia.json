    "intro": "Medicago laciniata var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and serrated, and its pea-like, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. This species is valued for its forage quality and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in agricultural settings."
