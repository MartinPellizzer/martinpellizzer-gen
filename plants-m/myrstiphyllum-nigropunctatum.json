    "intro": "Myrstiphyllum nigropunctatum, commonly known as the black-spotted myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often dotted with small, raised black spots, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that turn red when mature and are an important food source for native wildlife. Myrstiphyllum nigropunctatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
