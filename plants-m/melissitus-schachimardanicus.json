    "intro": "Melissitus schachimardanicus, commonly known as the Schachimardanicus melissitus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
