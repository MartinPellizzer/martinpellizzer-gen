    "intro": "Mammillaria polythele var. latimamma, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, globular shape with a ribbed stem covered in white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which open at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
