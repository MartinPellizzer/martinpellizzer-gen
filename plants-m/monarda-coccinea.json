    "intro": "Monarda coccinea, commonly known as scarlet beebalm, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its showy, red-orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its historical use by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
