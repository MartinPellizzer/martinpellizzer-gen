    "intro": "Mikania karsteniana, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in clusters along the stems. Its rapid growth habit and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in agricultural and natural areas. Mikania karsteniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
