    "intro": "Mammillaria pruinosa, commonly known as the powdered mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and a covering of fine, white waxy hairs that give it a powdery appearance. The plant features pale green to blue-gray stems with tubercles, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
