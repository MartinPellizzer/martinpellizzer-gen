    "intro": "Miconia saxicola, commonly known as the rock miconia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Miconia saxicola is also notable for its ability to grow on rocky substrates, which is reflected in its common name."
