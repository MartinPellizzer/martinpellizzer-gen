It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
