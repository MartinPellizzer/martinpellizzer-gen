    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii var. minor, commonly known as the small water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble clover, and it produces tiny, greenish flowers that are often submerged. It is a perennial species that spreads by means of rhizomes and is often found in still or slow-moving water. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
