    "intro": "Mimosa mahilakensis, commonly known as the Indian sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Due to its unique leaf movement, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation."
