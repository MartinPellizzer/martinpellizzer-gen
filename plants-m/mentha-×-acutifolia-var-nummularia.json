    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 acutifolia var. nummularia, commonly known as penny mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and oval, slightly hairy leaves that are typically a bright green color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its aromatic leaves and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for both its visual appeal and mild mint-like fragrance."
