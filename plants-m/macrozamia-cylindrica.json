    "intro": "Macrozamia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
