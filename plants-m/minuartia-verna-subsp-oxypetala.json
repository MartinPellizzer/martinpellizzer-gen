    "intro": "Minuartia verna subsp. oxypetala, commonly known as the spring rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. The leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, known for its characteristic cross-shaped flowers and specialized seed pods. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in crevices or on slopes where other plants struggle to grow."
