    "intro": "Mesosphaerum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine mesosphaerum, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Mesosphaerum alpestre is considered a species of conservation concern."
