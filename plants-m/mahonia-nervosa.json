    "intro": "Mahonia nervosa, commonly known as the evergreen holly or coastal mahonia, is a shrub native to the western coast of North America. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and woodlands. Mahonia nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
