    "intro": "Marrubium supinum, commonly known as creeping horehound, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features woody stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a strong, aromatic scent. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
