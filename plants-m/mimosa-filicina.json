    "intro": "Mimosa filicina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings."
