    "intro": "Mitrephora reticulata var. acutata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved mitrephora, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
