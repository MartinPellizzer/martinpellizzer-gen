    "intro": "Millettia macrostachya var. multifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leaved millettia, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which can have multiple leaflets, giving it a lush, foliage-dense appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in some regions."
