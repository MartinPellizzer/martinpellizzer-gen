    "intro": "Mimulus glabratus, commonly known as the smooth monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright orange or yellow flowers, which are typically tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has smooth, hairless leaves that are lance-shaped and often arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and woodland areas. Mimulus glabratus is a perennial species that produces seeds in capsule-like structures, contributing to its reproductive success in its native habitat."
