It features lance-shaped leaves that are silver-gray in color due to dense pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers are both ornamental, contributing to its popularity among gardeners."
