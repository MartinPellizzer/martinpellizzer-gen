    "intro": "Mertensia pteridifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that resemble fern fronds. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers in early spring, which are typical of the Campanulaceae family. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive, slightly lobed appearance. Mertensia pteridifolia thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils."
