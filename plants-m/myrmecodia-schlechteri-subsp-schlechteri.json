    "intro": "Myrmecodia schlechteri subsp. schlechteri, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant's symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological role in tropical forests."
