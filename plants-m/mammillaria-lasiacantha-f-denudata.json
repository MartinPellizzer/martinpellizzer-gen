It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in sparse, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized collections and requires careful care to ensure its survival."
