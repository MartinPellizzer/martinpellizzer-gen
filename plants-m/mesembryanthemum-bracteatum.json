It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers adapted to arid environments. The plant produces spherical clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in response to morning dew, giving it its common name. Its leaves are thick and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
