    "intro": "Meterana palustris, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Meterana palustris thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
