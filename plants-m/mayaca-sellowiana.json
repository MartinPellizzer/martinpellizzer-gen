    "intro": "Mayaca sellowiana, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Mayaca sellowiana plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
