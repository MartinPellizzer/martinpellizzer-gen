    "intro": "Minuartia stolonifera, commonly known as the sand pearl or rock rose, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Minuartia stolonifera is often found in coastal dunes, cliffs, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
