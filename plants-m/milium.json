    "intro": "Milium, commonly known as mouseear millet, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically small, annual herbs with slender stems and narrow leaves. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, grass-like flowers. Milium species are often found in disturbed soils and are common in temperate regions. They are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for insects."
