    "intro": "Muhlenbergia eriophylla, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. The plant produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton or down. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
