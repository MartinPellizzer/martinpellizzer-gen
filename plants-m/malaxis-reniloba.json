    "intro": "Malaxis reniloba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on trees or rocks in dense forest canopies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis reniloba is highly sought after in both conservation and horticultural circles."
