    "intro": "Microlicia carnosula, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and small, leathery leaves that have a reddish hue. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and the demand for its wood, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
