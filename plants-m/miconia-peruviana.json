    "intro": "Miconia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, which bloom in clusters. It is also noted for its fruit, which consists of a fleshy, woody capsule containing numerous small seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
