    "intro": "Medinilla oblongifolia, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet leaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of pink or white, which bloom throughout the year in suitable climates. Its ornamental value is largely due to its attractive foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
