    "intro": "Myriophyllum caput-medusae, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It has long, slender, branching stems that resemble the rays of a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, green, floating flowers that are often clustered together. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving waters. Myriophyllum caput-medusae is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
