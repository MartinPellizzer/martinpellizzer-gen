    "intro": "Myrtomera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Myrtomera thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or disturbed soils. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
