    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. microcephala, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and stream sides in Europe and Asia. It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, making it valuable for both traditional and modern medicinal uses."
