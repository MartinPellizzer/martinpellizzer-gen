    "intro": "Mesostemma martjanovii, commonly known as the Mongolian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mesostemma martjanovii is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
