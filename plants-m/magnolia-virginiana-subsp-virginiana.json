It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
