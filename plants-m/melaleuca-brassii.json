    "intro": "Melaleuca brassii, commonly known as the broad-leaved melaleuca, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it thrives in wetland and swampy environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water and wind. Melaleuca brassii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
