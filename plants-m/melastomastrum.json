    "intro": "Melastomastrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, often velvety leaves and showy, typically red or purple flowers. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Melastomastrum species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
