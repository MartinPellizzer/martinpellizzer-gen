    "intro": "Meliosma wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
