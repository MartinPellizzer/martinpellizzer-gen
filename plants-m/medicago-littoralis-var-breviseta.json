    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. breviseta, commonly known as the coastal medic, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in disturbed or degraded habitats."
