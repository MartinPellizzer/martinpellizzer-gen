    "intro": "Melancranis praemorsa, commonly known as the black death orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark purple to black petals, which are often speckled with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the late summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its endangered status, it is protected in several conservation areas and is rarely found in cultivation."
