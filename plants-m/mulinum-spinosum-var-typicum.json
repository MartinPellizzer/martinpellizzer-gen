    "intro": "Mulinum spinosum var. typicum, commonly known as the spiny mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, velvety leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
