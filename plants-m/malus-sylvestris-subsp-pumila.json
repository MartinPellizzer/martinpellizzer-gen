    "intro": "Malus sylvestris subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf crabapple, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart apples that are often used in culinary or medicinal applications. It is well-suited for ornamental gardening due to its attractive form and seasonal interest. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact structure compared to the typical Malus sylvestris."
