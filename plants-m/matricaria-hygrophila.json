    "intro": "Matricaria hygrophila, commonly known as swamp chamomile, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with white centers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
