    "intro": "Microlepia nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese chain fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. Microlepia nipponica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
