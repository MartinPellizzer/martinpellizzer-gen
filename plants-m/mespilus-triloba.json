    "intro": "Mespilus triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three distinct, lobed leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that ripen in the fall. The fruit has a distinctive, musky aroma and a soft, mealy texture when mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
