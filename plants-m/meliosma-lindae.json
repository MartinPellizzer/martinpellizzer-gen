    "intro": "Meliosma lindae, commonly known as the Lind's meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
