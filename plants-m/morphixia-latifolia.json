    "intro": "Morphixia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf morphixia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. These flowers are typically arranged in terminal panicles and are known for their subtle, sweet scent. Morphixia latifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
