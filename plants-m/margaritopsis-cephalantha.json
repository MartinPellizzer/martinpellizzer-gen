It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, white to pale blue flowers that resemble small pearls, hence its common name. It produces clusters of small, rounded blooms that are often arranged in dense inflorescences. Margaritopsis cephalantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
