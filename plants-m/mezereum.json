    "intro": "Mezereum, commonly known as the May apple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, green, fleshy fruit that ripens to a yellowish color by late summer. Mezereum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its medicinal properties, though its berries are toxic if ingested. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
