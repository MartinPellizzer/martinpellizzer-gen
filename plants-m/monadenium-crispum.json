    "intro": "Monadenium crispum, commonly known as the crinkled cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a compact, globular shape with ribbed stems that are covered in short, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Monadenium crispum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
