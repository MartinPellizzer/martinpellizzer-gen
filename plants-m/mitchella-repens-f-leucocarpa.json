    "intro": "Mitchella repens f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited trailing woodbine, is a rare variant of the trailing woodbine. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and dark green, while the flowers are small, white, and fragrant. The distinguishing feature of this form is its white, fleshy berries, which contrast with the typical red berries of the species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland undergrowth."
