    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca var. exsicca, commonly known as the dried banana plant, is a variant of the banana plant characterized by its desiccated leaves and stems. This variety is often used in horticultural and ornamental contexts due to its unique, preserved appearance. Unlike fresh banana plants, it lacks the ability to produce fruit, making it primarily a decorative species. The plant's botanical features include thick, fibrous stems and papery, layered leaves that are typically brown or yellow in color. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a specimen plant."
