    "intro": "Massartina, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful spatulate leaves and umbellate inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia, Massartina species thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plants have a rhizomatous root system, which helps them spread and establish in moist soils. Their botanical features make them popular in ornamental horticulture, though they can be toxic to humans and animals."
