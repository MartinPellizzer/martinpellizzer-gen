    "intro": "Moenchia bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian moenchia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in loose clusters and bloom in late summer. Moenchia bulgarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
