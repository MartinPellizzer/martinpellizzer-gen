    "intro": "Myrsine ruminata, commonly known as the rough myrsine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Myrsine ruminata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along streambanks."
