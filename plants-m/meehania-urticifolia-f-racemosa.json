It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stem and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple or blue, which are arranged in racemes, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories across eastern Australia. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
