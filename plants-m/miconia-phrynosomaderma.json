    "intro": "Miconia phrynosomaderma, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
