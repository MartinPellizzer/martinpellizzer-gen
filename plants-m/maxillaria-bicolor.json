    "intro": "Maxillaria bicolor, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a prominent lip that is often a different color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
