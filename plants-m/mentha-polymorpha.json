    "intro": "Mentha polymorpha, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its square, hollow stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale purple or white flowers arranged in whorled clusters. Mentha polymorpha is known for its strong aromatic properties, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
