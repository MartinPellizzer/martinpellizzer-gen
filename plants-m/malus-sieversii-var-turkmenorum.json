    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. turkmenorum, commonly known as the Turkmen apple, is a wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits and rugged, deciduous shrub or small tree form. This variety is closely related to the domesticated apple (Malus domestica) and is considered a key ancestor in apple domestication. Its natural habitat includes arid and semi-arid regions, where it exhibits high drought tolerance. The plant's genetic diversity is of significant interest to botanists and horticulturists for breeding programs aimed at improving apple resilience and flavor."
