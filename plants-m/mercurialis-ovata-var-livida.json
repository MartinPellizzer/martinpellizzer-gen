It is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae, characterized by its distinctive, dark green, almost black leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in complex inflorescences known as cyathia. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.
