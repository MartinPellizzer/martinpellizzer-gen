    "intro": "Microtoena affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf microtoena, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
