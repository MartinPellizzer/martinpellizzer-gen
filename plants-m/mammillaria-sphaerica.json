    "intro": "Mammillaria sphaerica, commonly known as the globular hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of small, white spines. The plant has a compact growth habit, with stems that remain short and rounded throughout its life. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in the early spring. Mammillaria sphaerica is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and requiring minimal care in cultivation."
