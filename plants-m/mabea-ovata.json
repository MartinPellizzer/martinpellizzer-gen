    "intro": "Mabea ovata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody pods containing small, round seeds. Mabea ovata is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in craftsmanship and as a source of timber. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native habitat."
