It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that form a hollow, chamber-like structure. The plant hosts ants in these chambers, which provide protection and nutrients in exchange for shelter. Its leaves are small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a rosette pattern. Myrmecodia brassii is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance and interesting symbiotic relationship with ants."
