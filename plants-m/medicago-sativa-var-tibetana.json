    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. tibetana, commonly known as Tibetan clover, is a variant of the common medick that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. This plant is adapted to cold climates and poor soils, making it resilient in alpine regions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to the harsh conditions of the Tibetan Plateau."
