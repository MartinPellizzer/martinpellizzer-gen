    "intro": "Miconia flaviflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia flaviflora is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
