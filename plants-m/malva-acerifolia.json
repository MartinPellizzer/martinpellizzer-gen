    "intro": "Malva acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaved mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble those of maple trees, and its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
