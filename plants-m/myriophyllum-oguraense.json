It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by tiny, floating fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Myriophyllum oguraense is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in aquatic ecosystems."
