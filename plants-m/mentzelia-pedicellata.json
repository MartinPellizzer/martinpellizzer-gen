    "intro": "Mentzelia pedicellata, commonly known as the desert bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as desert grasslands and sandy soils. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Mentzelia pedicellata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
