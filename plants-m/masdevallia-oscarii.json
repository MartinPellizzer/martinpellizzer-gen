    "intro": "Masdevallia oscarii, commonly known as the Oscar's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flower structure with long, slender petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as a small, terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and is adapted to high-altitude, humid environments. Its flowers are usually fragrant and bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
