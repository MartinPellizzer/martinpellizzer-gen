    "intro": "Myoporum lequerrei, commonly known as the coastal myoporum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species for coastal landscapes. Its root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ornamental value."
