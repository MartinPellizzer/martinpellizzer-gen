    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. ballotifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas, where it forms dense colonies. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and produce a mild, mint-like fragrance. The species is notable for its adaptability and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
