    "intro": "Myrceugenia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plants typically have small, glossy leaves and produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the genus is characterized by its aromatic foliage and adaptability to various soil types. Myrceugenia species are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
