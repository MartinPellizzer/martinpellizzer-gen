    "intro": "Marsupiaria valenzuelana var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Marsupiaria, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
