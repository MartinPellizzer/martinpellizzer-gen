    "intro": "Megalastrum oreocharis, commonly known as the orange-leafed rock heath, is a small shrub native to the rocky habitats of southern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive orange-colored leaves, which are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to grow in well-drained, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
