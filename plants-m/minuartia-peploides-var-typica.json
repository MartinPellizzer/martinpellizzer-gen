    "intro": "Minuartia peploides var. typica, commonly known as the white sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with thin, fleshy leaves adapted to cold and dry environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
