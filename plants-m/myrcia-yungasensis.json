    "intro": "Myrcia yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid montane forests of Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and limited research, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
