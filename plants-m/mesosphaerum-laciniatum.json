It is characterized by its delicate, lobed leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
