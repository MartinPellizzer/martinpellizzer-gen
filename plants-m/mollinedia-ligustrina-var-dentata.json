    "intro": "Mollinedia ligustrina var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated mollinedia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are typically borne on long, slender pedicels and are pollinated by insects. The species is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
