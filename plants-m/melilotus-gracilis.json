    "intro": "Melilotus gracilis, commonly known as slender melilot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Melilotus gracilis is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
