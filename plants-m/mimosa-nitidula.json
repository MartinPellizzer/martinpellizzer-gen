    "intro": "Mimosa nitidula, commonly known as the smooth mimosa, is a small shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Mimosa nitidula is known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
