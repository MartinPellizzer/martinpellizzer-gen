    "intro": "Meconopsis pulchella var. melananthera, commonly known as the black anther meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark purple to black anthers, which contrast sharply with its pale blue or violet petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually solitary and bloom in early summer, adding a unique visual element to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
