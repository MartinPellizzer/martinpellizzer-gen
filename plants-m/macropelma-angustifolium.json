It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a thick, rhizomatous stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is a common trait in the Araceae family. The plant's leaves are usually narrow and elongated, contributing to its common name."
