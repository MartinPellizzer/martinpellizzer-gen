    "intro": "Melastoma alatum, commonly known as the winged melastoma, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Melastoma alatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
