    "intro": "Miconia gossypina, commonly known as the wooly miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia gossypina is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
