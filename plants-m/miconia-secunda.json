    "intro": "Miconia secunda, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia secunda is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, posing a threat to native plant species."
