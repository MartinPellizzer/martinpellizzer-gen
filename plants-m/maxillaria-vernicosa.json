    "intro": "Maxillaria vernicosa, commonly known as the waxy maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, and it produces small, greenish-black seeds that are dispersed by wind. Maxillaria vernicosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
