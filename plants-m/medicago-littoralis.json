    "intro": "Medicago littoralis, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system. Medicago littoralis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in coastal ecosystems."
