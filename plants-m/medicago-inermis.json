    "intro": "Medicago inermis, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and is capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Medicago inermis is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
