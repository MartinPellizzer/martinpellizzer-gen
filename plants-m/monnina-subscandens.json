It typically features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Monnina subscandens is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows."
