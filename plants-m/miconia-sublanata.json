    "intro": "Miconia sublanata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia sublanata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
