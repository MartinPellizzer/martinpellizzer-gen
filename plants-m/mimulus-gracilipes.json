    "intro": "Mimulus gracilipes, commonly known as the slender monkeyflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and moist meadows. Mimulus gracilipes is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
