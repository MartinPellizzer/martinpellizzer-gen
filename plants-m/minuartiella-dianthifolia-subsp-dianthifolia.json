    "intro": "Minuartiella dianthifolia subsp. dianthifolia, commonly known as the rock cress, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as limestone outcrops and gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is a perennial species that is well adapted to harsh, arid conditions."
