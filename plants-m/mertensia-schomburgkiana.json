It is characterized by its striking clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
