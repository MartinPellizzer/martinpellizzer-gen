    "intro": "Medicago minima var. viscida, commonly known as sticky medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered with fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
