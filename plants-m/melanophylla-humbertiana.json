    "intro": "Melanophylla humbertiana, commonly known as the Humbert's ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pale purple to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions against the dark foliage. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its delicate, tubular corolla and hairy stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
