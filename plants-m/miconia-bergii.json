    "intro": "Miconia bergii, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain numerous seeds. Miconia bergii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a common ornamental plant in tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
