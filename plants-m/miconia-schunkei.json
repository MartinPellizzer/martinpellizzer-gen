    "intro": "Miconia schunkei, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor, often used in local cuisines. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
