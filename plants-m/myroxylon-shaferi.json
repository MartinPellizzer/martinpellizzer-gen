    "intro": "Myroxylon shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's Brazilwood, is a rare and ancient tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and require specific conditions to germinate. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Myroxylon shaferi is considered an endangered species."
