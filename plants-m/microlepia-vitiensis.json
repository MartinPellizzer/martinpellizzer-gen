    "intro": "Microlepia vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, including Fiji and Tonga. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically arching or upright. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Microlepia vitiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
