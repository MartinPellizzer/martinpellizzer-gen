    "intro": "Moluccella fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's bellflower, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and showy blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale blue, are often adorned with intricate patterns and are a key feature of its botanical appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
