    "intro": "Mollia stellaris, commonly known as the star moss, is a small, low-growing plant that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It features delicate, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name, and its foliage is often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant is typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices, where it forms dense mats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown in color. Mollia stellaris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
