    "intro": "Microsteris heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaved microsteris, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that vary in shape and size depending on light conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the spring. Microsteris heterophylla is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in rich, organic soils."
