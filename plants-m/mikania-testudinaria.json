    "intro": "Mikania testudinaria, commonly known as the creeping oxalis, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often mistaken for those of oxalis species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in many regions."
