    "intro": "Medicago turbinata var. neglecta, commonly known as the lesser crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit with a fibrous root system, making it adaptable to various soil types. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
