    "intro": "Maireana decalvans, commonly known as the Grey Ghostbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its greyish, hairless stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with low rainfall. Maireana decalvans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
