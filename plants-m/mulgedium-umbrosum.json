    "intro": "Mulgedium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadowbloom, is a rare and elusive plant found in shaded, moist forest understories. It has dark green, velvety leaves that are slightly lobed and emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom only during the twilight hours. Its roots are fibrous and highly absorbent, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soil. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem."
