It features long, white spines that are often more pronounced than those of the typical Mammillaria discolor. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. This variety is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
