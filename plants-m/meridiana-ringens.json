    "intro": "Meridiana ringens, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Meridiana ringens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
