    "intro": "Milium halepense, commonly known as the Persian wheatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and grows in dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, followed by clusters of spikelets containing edible grains. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in many regions but has also been used in traditional medicine."
