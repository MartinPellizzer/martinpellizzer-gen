    "intro": "Micromeria spicigera, commonly known as the spiculate micromeria, is a small annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
