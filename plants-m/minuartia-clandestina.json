    "intro": "Minuartia clandestina, commonly known as the hidden rockcress, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Minuartia clandestina is known for its ability to survive in extreme climates, making it a resilient and hardy species."
