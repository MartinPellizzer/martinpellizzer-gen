    "intro": "Matricaria inodora subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple composite flowers and silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. It has a compact growth habit and is resistant to salt spray, making it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is often considered an invasive species in some areas."
