    "intro": "Melaleuca uniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in spikes, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a reddish hue when young. Melaleuca uniflora is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often found in heathlands and open forests."
