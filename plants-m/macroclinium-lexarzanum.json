    "intro": "Macroclinium lexarzanum, commonly known as the Zambian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues, making it a visually striking plant. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
