    "intro": "Marsilea elata, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, with four leaflets arranged in a cross shape. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It reproduces through spores, which are released from sporocarps that develop on the underside of its leaves. Marsilea elata is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive appearance and ability to help control algae growth."
