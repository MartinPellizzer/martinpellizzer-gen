    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. icmadogena, commonly known as the water mint, is a subspecies of the aquatic mint plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and other water bodies. Due to its aromatic leaves and adaptability to wet conditions, it is both ecologically significant and used in traditional herbal remedies."
