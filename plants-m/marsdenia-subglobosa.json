    "intro": "Marsdenia subglobosa, commonly known as the globular milkweed, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care."
