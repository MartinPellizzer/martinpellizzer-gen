It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with oval leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
