    "intro": "Meconopsis principis, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet petals and is closely related to the genus Meconopsis, which includes several species of poppies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the alpine meadows. Due to its beauty and rarity, Meconopsis principis is also considered a symbol of the Himalayan region."
