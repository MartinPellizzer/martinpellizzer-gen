    "intro": "Mathewsia auriculata, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to orange fronds that resemble cups, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters on the fronds. Mathewsia auriculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
