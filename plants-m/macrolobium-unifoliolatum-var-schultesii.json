It is characterized by its distinctive, single leaflet that is often broad and ovate in shape. The plant typically grows in tropical or subtropical environments, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features include a woody stem with a smooth, sometimes reddish bark. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
