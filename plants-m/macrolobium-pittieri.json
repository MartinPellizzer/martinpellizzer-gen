    "intro": "Macrolobium pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's giant lobelia, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
