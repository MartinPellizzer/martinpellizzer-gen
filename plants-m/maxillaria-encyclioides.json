    "intro": "Maxillaria encyclioides, commonly known as the cyclopean orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, showy inflorescence that resembles a small wheel, with flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal care. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Maxillaria encyclioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
