    "intro": "Menyanthes pumila, commonly known as the dwarf marsh woundwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. Menyanthes pumila is notable for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and is an indicator species for certain types of wetland habitats."
