    "intro": "Magnolia \u00d7 foggii, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia or the double-flowered magnolia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Magnolia denudata and Magnolia liliiflora. It is native to China and is characterized by its large, showy, double flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine."
