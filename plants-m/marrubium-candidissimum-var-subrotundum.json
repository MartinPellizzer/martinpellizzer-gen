    "intro": "Marrubium candidissimum var. subrotundum, commonly known as white horehound, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features hairy, gray-green leaves that are oval to rounded in shape, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in the summer. The plant is often found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in well-drained environments. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly bitter leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid conditions, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
