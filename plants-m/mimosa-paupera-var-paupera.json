    "intro": "Mimosa paupera var. paupera, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular choice for educational and ornamental purposes."
