    "intro": "Macroceratides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. Macroceratides species are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. They have a fibrous root system that helps them stabilize in sandy soils, and their leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, such as *Macroceratides glomerata*, which is native to the Mediterranean region."
