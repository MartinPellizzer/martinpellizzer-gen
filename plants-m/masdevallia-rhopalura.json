    "intro": "Masdevallia rhopalura, commonly known as the \"Lizard Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, often bi-colored flowers that resemble lizards, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are usually pink or red with contrasting yellow or green markings, and it blooms during the cooler months. Masdevallia rhopalura is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
