    "intro": "Medinilla hasseltii var. subsessilis, commonly known as the dwarf medinilla, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
