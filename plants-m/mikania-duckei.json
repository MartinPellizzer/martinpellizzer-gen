    "intro": "Mikania duckei, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and twining stems that can climb and cover large areas. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming throughout the growing season. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
