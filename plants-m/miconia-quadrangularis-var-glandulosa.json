    "intro": "Miconia quadrangularis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often veined with red or purple. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features include its unique leaf shape and the presence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves."
