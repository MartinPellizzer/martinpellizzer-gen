    "intro": "Manilkara maxima, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into hard, woody pods. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which contains the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The plant is valued for its ecological role and economic importance, particularly in the production of Brazil nuts. Its growth is slow, and it can live for over a century, making it a significant component of the rainforest ecosystem."
