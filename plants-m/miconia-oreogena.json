    "intro": "Miconia oreogena, commonly known as the mountain miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the highlands of Central America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. Miconia oreogena is typically found in moist, shaded habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters."
