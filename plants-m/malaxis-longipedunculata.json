    "intro": "Malaxis longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids in its native environment."
