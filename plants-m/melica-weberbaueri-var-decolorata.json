    "intro": "Melica weberbaueri var. decolorata, commonly known as the pale meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a pale green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. This variety is characterized by its reduced florets and a distinctive pale coloration, which sets it apart from other melica species."
