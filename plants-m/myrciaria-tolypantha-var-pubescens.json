It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine and local cuisine. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of the understory vegetation in humid tropical environments. The varietal form, pubescens, is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical variety."
