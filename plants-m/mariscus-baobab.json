    "intro": "Mariscus baobab, commonly known as the African baobab, is a large, deciduous tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fibrous bark. The tree produces yellow, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing edible seeds. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The tree is also known for its ability to store water in its trunk, making it well-adapted to drought conditions."
