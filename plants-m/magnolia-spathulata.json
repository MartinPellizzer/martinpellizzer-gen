    "intro": "Magnolia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 4 to 8 inches in length. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. Magnolia spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its beauty and fragrance."
