    "intro": "Micromeria pitardii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has small, narrow leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Micromeria pitardii is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
