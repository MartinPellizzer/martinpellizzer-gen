    "intro": "Manilkara emarginata subsp. haitensis, commonly known as Haitian sapote, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by pear-shaped fruits with a thick, sweet pulp. Its fruit is edible and has a flavor similar to a combination of sapote and persimmon, making it valuable both nutritionally and economically."
