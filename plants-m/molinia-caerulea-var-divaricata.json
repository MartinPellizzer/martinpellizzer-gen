    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. divaricata, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a variant of the common moor grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth and striking purple to pinkish flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and bogs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
