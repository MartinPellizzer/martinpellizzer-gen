    "intro": "Mella beccabunga, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense clusters near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale purple flowers bloom in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its aquatic habitat. Mella beccabunga is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters, making it an indicator species for certain wetland ecosystems."
