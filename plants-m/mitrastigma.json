    "intro": "Mitrastigma, commonly known as the \"spider orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India, China, and the Philippines. Mitrastigma species are characterized by their slender, climbing stems and showy, fragrant flowers that often resemble spiders due to their unique shape and coloration. They typically grow in shaded, moist environments and require well-draining soil to thrive. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in horticulture."
