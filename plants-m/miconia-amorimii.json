It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are bright red berries that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal by birds and mammals. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
