It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, characterized by its bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and produces distinctive bottlebrush-shaped inflorescences. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The coastal bottlebrush plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for native pollinators."
