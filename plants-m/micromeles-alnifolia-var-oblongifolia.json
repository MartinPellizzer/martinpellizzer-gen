    "intro": "Micromeles alnifolia var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, upright stems with a greyish-brown bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic to oblong in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent underside. It produces small, catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks."
