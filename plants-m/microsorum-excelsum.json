    "intro": "Microsorum excelsum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with thick, creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the sori are arranged in lines along the underside of the fronds. Microsorum excelsum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
