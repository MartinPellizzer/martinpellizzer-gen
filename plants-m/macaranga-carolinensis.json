    "intro": "Macaranga carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina mallow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and has opposite, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. The species is valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
