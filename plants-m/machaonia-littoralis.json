    "intro": "Machaonia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal machaonia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Machaonia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
