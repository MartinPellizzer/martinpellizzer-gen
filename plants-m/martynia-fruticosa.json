    "intro": "Martynia fruticosa, commonly known as the red mallow or sweet mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental cultivation in warm climates."
