    "intro": "Macrosiphonia petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. It is composed of a symbiotic association between a cyanobacterium and a fungal partner, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant exhibits a dark green to brownish thallus with a distinctive, leathery texture. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecosystem health."
