    "intro": "Maxillaria ochracea, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellow to orange flowers in a raceme, which bloom during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic species. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems."
