    "intro": "Malva vivianiana, commonly known as the Persian silk cotton tree, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Malva vivianiana is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
