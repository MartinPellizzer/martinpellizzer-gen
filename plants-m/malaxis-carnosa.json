    "intro": "Malaxis carnosa, commonly known as the hairy malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, unbranched stem that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the stem. Malaxis carnosa is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories."
