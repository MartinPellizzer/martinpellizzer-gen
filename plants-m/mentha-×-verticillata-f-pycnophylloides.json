    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. pycnophylloides, commonly known as the dense-leaved water mint, is a hybrid plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, overlapping leaves that give it a bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a strong menthol scent, and it produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover in damp areas."
