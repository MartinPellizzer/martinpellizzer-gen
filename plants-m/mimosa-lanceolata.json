    "intro": "Mimosa lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Mimosa lanceolata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
