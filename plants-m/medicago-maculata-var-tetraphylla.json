    "intro": "Medicago maculata var. tetraphylla, commonly known as purple needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. This plant is often found in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help prevent soil erosion. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
