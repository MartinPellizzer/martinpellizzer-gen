    "intro": "Marlothiella gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree of the Karoo, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its ability to exude a sticky, resinous sap, which has been used traditionally by indigenous communities. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to the harsh environments of the Karoo region. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
