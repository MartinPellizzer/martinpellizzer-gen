    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. altissima, commonly known as the tall sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, sickle-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
