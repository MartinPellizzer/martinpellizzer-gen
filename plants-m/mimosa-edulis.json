It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its edible parts include the young shoots and leaves, which are often used in local cuisines. Mimosa edulis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
