    "intro": "Myrtus tabasco, commonly known as the Tabasco myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its aromatic oils, similar to those of myrtle, are released when the leaves are crushed. Myrtus tabasco is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
