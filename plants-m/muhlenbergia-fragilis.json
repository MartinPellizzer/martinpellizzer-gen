    "intro": "Muhlenbergia fragilis, commonly known as the silvergrass or brittle muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its slender, upright stems and light-colored leaves make it a visually striking ornamental plant. Muhlenbergia fragilis is also valued for its ability to thrive in dry conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
