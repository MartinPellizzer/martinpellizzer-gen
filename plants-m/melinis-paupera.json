    "intro": "Melinis paupera, commonly known as poor man's grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
