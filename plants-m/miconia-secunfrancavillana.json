    "intro": "Miconia secunfrancavillana, commonly known as the \"false hibiscus,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
