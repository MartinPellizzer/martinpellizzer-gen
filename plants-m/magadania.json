It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, compound leaves, and small, often fragrant flowers. Magadania species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship.
