    "intro": "Mitragyna javanica var. microphylla, commonly known as kratom, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which contribute to its medicinal and stimulant properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its leaves rather than its wood."
