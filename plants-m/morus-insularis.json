    "intro": "Morus insularis, commonly known as the Ryukyu mulberry, is a small deciduous tree native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by oval, dark purple berries. Morus insularis is adapted to coastal environments and thrives in sandy soils with high salinity. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional practices by the indigenous Ryukyuan people."
