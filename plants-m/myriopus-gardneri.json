    "intro": "Myriopus gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's myriopus, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form low, compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Myriopus gardneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
