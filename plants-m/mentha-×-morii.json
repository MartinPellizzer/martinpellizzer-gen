    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 morii, commonly known as Japanese catmint, is a hybrid mint species native to East Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue to lavender flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Mentha \u00d7 morii is valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Mentha sylvestris and Mentha \u00d7 gracilis."
