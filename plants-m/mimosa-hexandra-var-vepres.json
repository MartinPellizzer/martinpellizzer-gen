    "intro": "Mimosa hexandra var. vepres, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by sensitive hairs called trichomes. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value and unique leaf movements make it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
