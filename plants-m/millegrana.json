    "intro": "Millegrana, commonly known as the \"dwarf Christmas tree,\" is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscape design for its year-round visual interest."
