    "intro": "Macrosiphonia petraea var. pinifolia, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, forming dense, crust-like growths. The plant's structure is characterized by a thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality."
