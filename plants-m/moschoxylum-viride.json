It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of greenish hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation in humid climates."
