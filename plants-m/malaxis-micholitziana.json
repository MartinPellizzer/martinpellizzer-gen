    "intro": "Malaxis micholitziana, commonly known as the Micholitz's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, leafy growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
