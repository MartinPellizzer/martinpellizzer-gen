    "intro": "Mentha longifolia subsp. longifolia, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
