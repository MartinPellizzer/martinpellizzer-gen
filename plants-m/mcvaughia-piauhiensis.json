    "intro": "Mcvaughia piauhiensis, commonly known as the Piauhi sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the dry, sandy soils of the Piau\u00ed region in northeastern Brazil. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows as a low shrub, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
