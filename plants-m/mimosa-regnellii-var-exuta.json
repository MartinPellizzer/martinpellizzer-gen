    "intro": "Mimosa regnellii var. exuta, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
