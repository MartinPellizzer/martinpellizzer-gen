    "intro": "Myrovernix intricata, commonly known as the spiralleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its intricate, spiraling leaf patterns and small, pale violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptive evolution in extreme climates. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Myrovernix intricata is currently listed as endangered."
