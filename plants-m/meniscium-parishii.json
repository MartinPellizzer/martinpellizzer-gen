    "intro": "Meniscium parishii, commonly known as the New Zealand meniscium, is a small, flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
