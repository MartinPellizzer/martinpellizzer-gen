    "intro": "Minuartia corymbulosa var. corymbulosa, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically forms dense mats of foliage, with fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually white or pale yellow and are arranged in clusters, giving the plant its common name."
