    "intro": "Mammillaria solisioides, commonly known as the Solisioides prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
