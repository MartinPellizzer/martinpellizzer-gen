    "intro": "Mattiastrum velutinum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Mattiastrum velutinum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
