    "intro": "Matourea, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant and supports its heavy foliage. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Matourea plays an important ecological role by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water oxygenation."
