    "intro": "Mitrophyllum framesii, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round berries. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host plant and extract water and nutrients. Despite its parasitic nature, Mitrophyllum framesii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
