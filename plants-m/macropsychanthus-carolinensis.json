    "intro": "Macropsychanthus carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
