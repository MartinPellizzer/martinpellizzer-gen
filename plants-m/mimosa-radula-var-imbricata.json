    "intro": "Mimosa radula var. imbricata, commonly known as the rock mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun with minimal water. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
