    "intro": "Mikania periplocifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the morning. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
