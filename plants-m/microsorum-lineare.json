    "intro": "Microsorum lineare, commonly known as the linear water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length, with a distinctive linear form. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The fronds are usually light green, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance."
