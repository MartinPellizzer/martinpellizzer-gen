    "intro": "Madhuca acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tallowwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local timber industries. The plant also plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
