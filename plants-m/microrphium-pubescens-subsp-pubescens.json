    "intro": "Microrphium pubescens subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged stems and roots. Its small, white flowers appear in late summer and are clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing sediments."
