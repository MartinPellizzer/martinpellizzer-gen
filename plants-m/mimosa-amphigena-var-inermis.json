    "intro": "Mimosa amphigena var. inermis, commonly known as the soft mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features soft, feathery leaves that are typically pink to red in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, spherical seed pods. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
