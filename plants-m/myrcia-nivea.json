    "intro": "Myrcia nivea, commonly known as white myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are glossy and elliptical in shape. It produces small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Myrcia nivea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
