    "intro": "Merremia cielensis, commonly known as the Cielensis morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet or blue. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces long, twisting vines that can climb or trail along the ground. Its rapid growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions. The flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance."
