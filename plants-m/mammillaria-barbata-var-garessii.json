It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
