    "intro": "Macrocarpaea luctans, commonly known as the weeping lily, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its drooping, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
