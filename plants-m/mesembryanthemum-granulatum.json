    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum granulatum, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic landscapes."
