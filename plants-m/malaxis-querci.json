    "intro": "Malaxis querci, commonly known as the oak orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the forests of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near oak trees, which is reflected in its common name. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The orchid has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds."
