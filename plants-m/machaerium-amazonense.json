    "intro": "Machaerium amazonense, commonly known as the Amazonian machaerium, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, which is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind or animals. Machaerium amazonense plays a role in maintaining soil fertility and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
