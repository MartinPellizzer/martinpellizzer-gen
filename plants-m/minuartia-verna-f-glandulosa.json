    "intro": "Minuartia verna f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular spring sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in open, sunny habitats. Its glandular surfaces give it a distinctive appearance and aid in reducing water loss. This variant is notable for its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine and arctic regions."
