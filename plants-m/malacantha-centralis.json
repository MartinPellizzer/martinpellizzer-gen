    "intro": "Malacantha centralis, commonly known as the central spine cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green in color, adapted to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from a wide area. Malacantha centralis is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water once established."
