    "intro": "Mimosa pigra var. dehiscens, commonly known as the African mimosa, is a shrub native to the savannas of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the closing mechanism of its stipules. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing seeds by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats with adequate sunlight. Due to its unique morphological features and ecological role, it is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
