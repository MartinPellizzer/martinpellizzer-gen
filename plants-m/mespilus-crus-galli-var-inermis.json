    "intro": "Mespilus crus-galli var. inermis, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its oval, glossy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The fruit is a fleshy, edible pome that ripens in autumn, often developing a fermented flavor if left on the tree. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its historical use in traditional medicine. It also plays a role in supporting pollinators and providing habitat for wildlife."
