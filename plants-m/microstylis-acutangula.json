    "intro": "Microstylis acutangula, commonly known as the acute-angled microstylis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is a small, perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
