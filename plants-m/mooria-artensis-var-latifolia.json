    "intro": "Mooria artensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed mooria, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a delicate white or pale green color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
