    "intro": "Mastigion proboscideum, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant orange flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas near water sources."
