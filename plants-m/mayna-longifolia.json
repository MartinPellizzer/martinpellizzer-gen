    "intro": "Mayna longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf mayna, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Mayna longifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
