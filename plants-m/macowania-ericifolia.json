    "intro": "Macowania ericifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Macowania ericifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife."
