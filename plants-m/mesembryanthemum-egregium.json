    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum egregium, commonly known as the \"starry cushion\" or \"cushion mesem,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, dense growth with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a star-like appearance, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowering period is brief, making it a sought-after plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Mesembryanthemum egregium prefers well-draining soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
