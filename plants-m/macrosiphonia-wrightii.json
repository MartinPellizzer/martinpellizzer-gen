    "intro": "Macrosiphonia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline and sandy habitat. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
