    "intro": "Mimosa foliolosa subsp. brevibractea, commonly known as the narrow-bract mimosa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
