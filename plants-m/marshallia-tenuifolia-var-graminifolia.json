    "intro": "Marshallia tenuifolia var. graminifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in wet, open habitats such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in late summer. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in wetland restoration projects."
