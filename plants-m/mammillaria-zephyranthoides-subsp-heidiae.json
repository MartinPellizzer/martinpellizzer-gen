    "intro": "Mammillaria zephyranthoides subsp. heidiae, commonly known as the Heidii's milk barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, white, woolly spines and a dense covering of white, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
