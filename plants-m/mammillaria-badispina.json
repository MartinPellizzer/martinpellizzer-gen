    "intro": "Mammillaria badispina, commonly known as the white-furred hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
