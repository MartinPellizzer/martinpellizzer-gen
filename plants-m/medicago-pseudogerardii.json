    "intro": "Medicago pseudogerardii, commonly known as the false goat's head, is a perennial forage legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Medicago pseudogerardii is valued for its nutritional content and is used in range management and livestock grazing."
