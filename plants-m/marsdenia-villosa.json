It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
