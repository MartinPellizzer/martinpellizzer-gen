    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum pole-evansii, commonly known as the coastal mesembryanthemum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its fleshy stems and leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
