It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
