    "intro": "Miconia ricardoi, commonly known as the black miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, dark green leaves that are usually heart-shaped and can grow up to 30 cm in length. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
