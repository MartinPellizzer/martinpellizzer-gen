It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
