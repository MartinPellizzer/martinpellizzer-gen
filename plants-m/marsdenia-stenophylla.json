It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
