    "intro": "Mimosa pigra var. pigra, commonly known as the African mimosa, is a shrub native to the savannas of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pods that release seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats with sufficient sunlight. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it can become invasive in certain regions."
