    "intro": "Muhlenbergia trichodes, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and fluffy, feathery seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Muhlenbergia trichodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
