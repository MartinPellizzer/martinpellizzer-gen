    "intro": "Mikania jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
