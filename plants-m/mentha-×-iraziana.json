    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 iraziana, commonly known as the Persian mint, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha longifolia and Mentha piperita. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Iran and is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with square stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in whorls, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mentha \u00d7 iraziana is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional Persian and Middle Eastern cuisines."
