    "intro": "Muscari racemosum, commonly known as the grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, giving it a striking, fragrant appearance. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it store water and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Muscari racemosum is known for its early spring bloom and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
