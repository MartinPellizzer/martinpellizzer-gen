    "intro": "Mammillaria prolifera subsp. prolifera, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and numerous small, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
