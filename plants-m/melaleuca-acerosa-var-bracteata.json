    "intro": "Melaleuca acerosa var. bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
