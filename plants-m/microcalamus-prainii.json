    "intro": "Microcalamus prainii, commonly known as the Prain's chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds. Microcalamus prainii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
