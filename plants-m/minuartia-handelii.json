    "intro": "Minuartia handelii, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in low-nutrient environments. Minuartia handelii is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
