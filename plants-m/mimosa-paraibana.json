    "intro": "Mimosa paraibana, commonly known as the Paraiba mimosa, is a shrub native to Brazil, particularly the state of Para\u00edba. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Mimosa paraibana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
