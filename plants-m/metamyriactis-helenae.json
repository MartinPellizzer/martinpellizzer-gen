    "intro": "Metamyriactis helenae, commonly known as the Helen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to thrive in coastal and semi-arid environments. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
