    "intro": "Maxillaria cryptobulbon, commonly known as the hidden bulb orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to form a network of underground rhizomes, which help it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, typically in shades of pink and white. Its flowers are borne on erect, slender stems and bloom during the dry season. The species is noted for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
