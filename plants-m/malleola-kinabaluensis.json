    "intro": "Malleola kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean malleola, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Malleola kinabaluensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
