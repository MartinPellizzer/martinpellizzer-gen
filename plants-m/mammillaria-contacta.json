    "intro": "Mammillaria contacta, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a compact stem that typically grows to about 10 centimeters in height. The plant features 10 to 15 prominent, rounded ribs that are often covered with white, woolly spines. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Mammillaria contacta is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem."
