    "intro": "Myoporum tuberculatum, commonly known as the rough myoporum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage with rough, tuberculate (knob-like) texture on the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. Its fibrous roots make it well adapted to sandy and saline soils, and it is often used in coastal landscaping. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
