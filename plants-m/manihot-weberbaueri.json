    "intro": "Manihot weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's manioc, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its herbaceous, perennial growth habit. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces small, greenish flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its roots are used in traditional practices, though it is less economically significant than other manioc species. The plant thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded undergrowth."
