    "intro": "Mimosa niederleinii, commonly known as the Niederlein's sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, specifically Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
