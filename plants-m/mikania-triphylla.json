    "intro": "Mikania triphylla, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the early morning. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in many regions. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae and is known for its fibrous stems and hairy foliage."
