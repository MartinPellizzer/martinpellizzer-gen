    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 limnogeton, commonly known as marsh mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha aquatica and Mentha longifolia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Mentha \u00d7 limnogeton thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its aromatic leaves and strong menthol scent make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
