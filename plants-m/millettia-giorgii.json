    "intro": "Millettia giorgii, commonly known as the African balsa, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces pods that contain flat, fibrous seeds, which are used in traditional crafts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its lightweight wood, it has been historically valued for its use in model building and as a source of fiber."
