It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into broad, overlapping segments. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that helps in nutrient absorption and propagation. Its leaves, or fronds, are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. Mesophlebion falcatilobum thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical forests."
