    "intro": "Medeola triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved basket, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by berries that mature to a dark red or black color. Medeola triphylla is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is known for its medicinal properties, though it is toxic if ingested in large quantities."
