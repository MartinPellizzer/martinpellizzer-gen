    "intro": "Myrmephytum selebicum, commonly known as the Java sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It is often found in coastal or dune environments due to its tolerance for saline and well-drained conditions. Myrmephytum selebicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
