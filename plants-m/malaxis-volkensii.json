    "intro": "Malaxis volkensii, commonly known as the Volkens' Malaxis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
