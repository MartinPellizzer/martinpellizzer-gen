    "intro": "Murdannia dimorphoides subsp. perennis, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers with orange centers. The plant is characterized by its ability to form a compact, drought-resistant structure, making it well-adapted to arid environments. It blooms throughout the growing season, typically from spring to autumn, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The subspecies perennis is distinguished by its more robust growth and extended flowering period compared to other subspecies."
