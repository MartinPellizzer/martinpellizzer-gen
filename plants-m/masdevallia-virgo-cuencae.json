    "intro": "Masdevallia virgo-cuencae, commonly known as the Cuenca virgo masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that sets it apart from other masdevallia species. The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in cool, humid environments. Its flowers bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle violet hue, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
