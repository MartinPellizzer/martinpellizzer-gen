    "intro": "Mollugo sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran carpetweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including gardens and roadside areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a common weed and a resilient species in its native range. The plant's botanical characteristics reflect its adaptability to tropical and subtropical environments."
