    "intro": "Myriocephalus cotuloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a persistent weed in agricultural areas. Myriocephalus cotuloides is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in low-water environments."
