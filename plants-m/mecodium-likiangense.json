It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
