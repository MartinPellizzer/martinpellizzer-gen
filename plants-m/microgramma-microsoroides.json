    "intro": "Microgramma microsoroides, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Microgramma microsoroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor gardens or as a houseplant."
