    "intro": "Mammillaria borwigii, commonly known as the Borwig's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with prominent tubercles and white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a dense covering of white bristles, which help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
