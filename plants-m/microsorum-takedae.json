    "intro": "Microsorum takedae, commonly known as Takeda's sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, acidic substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Microsorum takedae is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic life."
