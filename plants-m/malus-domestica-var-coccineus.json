    "intro": "Malus domestica var. coccineus, commonly known as the Red Beauty apple, is a cultivar of the domestic apple tree known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically a striking red or crimson color, especially in the fall, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. While it produces small, tart apples, its primary appeal lies in its aesthetic qualities rather than its fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental beauty."
