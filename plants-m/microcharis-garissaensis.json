    "intro": "Microcharis garissaensis, commonly known as the Garissa false hellebore, is a flowering plant native to Kenya. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense vegetation. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
