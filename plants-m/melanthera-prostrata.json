    "intro": "Melanthera prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate melanthera, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Melanthera prostrata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows."
