    "intro": "Mikania oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Mikania oblongifolia thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas."
