    "intro": "Mimosa distachya, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Mimosa distachya is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
