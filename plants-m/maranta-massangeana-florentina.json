    "intro": "Maranta massangeana florentina, commonly known as the Florence prayer plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its vivid, variegated foliage that displays shades of green, pink, and white, often with a waxy texture. The plant's leaves are known to fold shut in response to light changes, a phenomenon called nyctinasty. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and ease of care when provided with the right conditions."
