    "intro": "Medicago prostrata subsp. pseudorupestris, commonly known as creeping medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by narrow, elongated pods containing seeds. It is adapted to rocky and arid environments, with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
