    "intro": "Macrosolen pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf macrolen, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a smooth surface with a slight waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Acanthaceae family."
