It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to form a thick mat of foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution."
