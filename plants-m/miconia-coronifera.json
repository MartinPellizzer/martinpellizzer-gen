    "intro": "Miconia coronifera, commonly known as the crownleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a waxy texture and a distinctive crown-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions."
