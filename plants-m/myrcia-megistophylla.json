    "intro": "Myrcia megistophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. These flowers give way to small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. Myrcia megistophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
