    "intro": "Mimosa cavalum, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Mimosa cavalum is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural settings."
