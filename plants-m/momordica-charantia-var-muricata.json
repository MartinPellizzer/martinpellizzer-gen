    "intro": "Momordica charantia var. muricata, commonly known as bitter melon, is a tropical vine characterized by its distinctive, ridged, and spiny fruits. The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, though it is now cultivated in various warm climates worldwide. Its leaves are heart-shaped and lobed, while the stems are hairy and trailing. The fruit, which is typically harvested when immature, has a bitter taste due to the presence of alkaloids and other compounds. This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional medicine for its potential hypoglycemic properties."
