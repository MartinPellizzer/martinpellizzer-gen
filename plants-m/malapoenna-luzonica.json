    "intro": "Malapoenna luzonica, commonly known as the Luzon orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive system relies on specific pollinators, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Malapoenna luzonica is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
