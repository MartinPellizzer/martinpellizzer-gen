    "intro": "Mesosphaerum brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed globular cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to South America. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in sparse, pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
