    "intro": "Manilkara udoido, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces a heavy, aromatic fruit with a thick, inedible outer husk enclosing a single, hard-shelled seed. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a significant species in the timber industry. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
