    "intro": "Melampyrum praealpinum, commonly known as the alpine touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in open, rocky habitats. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
