    "intro": "Micranthocereus auri-azureus, commonly known as the Azure Nightshade Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils. The cactus is noted for its striking coloration and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
