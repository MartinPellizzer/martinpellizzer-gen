    "intro": "Myrtus sericea var. sufffruticosa, commonly known as the silky myrtle or dwarf myrtle, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic foliage and ability to tolerate salt spray."
