    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum stratum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, often blue or purple-hued leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, white, and pink, usually in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to low-maintenance landscapes."
