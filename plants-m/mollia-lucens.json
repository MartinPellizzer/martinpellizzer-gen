    "intro": "Mollia lucens, commonly known as the glowing moss, is a unique species of moss that exhibits bioluminescent properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or near water sources. The plant's ability to emit a faint blue light at night is due to specialized cells containing luciferin and luciferase. Its structure consists of tightly packed leaf-like structures and rhizoids that anchor it to surfaces. Mollia lucens plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
