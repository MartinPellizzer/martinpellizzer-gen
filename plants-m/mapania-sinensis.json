It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It often grows in sandy or rocky soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.
