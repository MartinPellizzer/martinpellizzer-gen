It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.
