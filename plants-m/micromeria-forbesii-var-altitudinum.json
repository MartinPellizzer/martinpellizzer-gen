    "intro": "Micromeria forbesii var. altitudinum, commonly known as the highland micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cooler, drier conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
