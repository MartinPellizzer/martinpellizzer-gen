    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum serpens, commonly known as the ice plant or living snow, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments."
