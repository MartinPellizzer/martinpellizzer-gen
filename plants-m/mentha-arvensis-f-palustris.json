    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. palustris, commonly known as marsh mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. Mentha arvensis f. palustris is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
