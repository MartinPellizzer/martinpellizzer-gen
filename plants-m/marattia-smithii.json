    "intro": "Marattia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's marattia, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a deep green color that contrasts with the pale undersides. Due to habitat loss, Marattia smithii is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded areas of old-growth forests."
