    "intro": "Meladerma insularum, commonly known as the island meladerma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island ecosystems. It belongs to the family Melandryaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slight waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meladerma insularum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
