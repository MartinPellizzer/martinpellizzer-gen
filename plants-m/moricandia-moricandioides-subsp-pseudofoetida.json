    "intro": "Moricandia moricandioides subsp. pseudofoetida, commonly known as the stinking wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found growing on rocky soils. Its strong, unpleasant odor is a distinguishing feature, particularly noticeable when the plant is in bloom."
