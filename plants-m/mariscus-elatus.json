    "intro": "Mariscus elatus, commonly known as the tall marsh clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in wet, acidic soils in temperate regions. The plant features whorled leaves that are often spirally arranged along its stems. It produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Mariscus elatus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
