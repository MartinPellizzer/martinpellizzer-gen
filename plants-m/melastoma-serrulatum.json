    "intro": "Melastoma serrulatum, commonly known as the red mistflower, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Melastoma serrulatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens."
