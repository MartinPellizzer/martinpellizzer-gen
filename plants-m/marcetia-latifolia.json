    "intro": "Marcetia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marsh environments in South America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in humid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in waterlogged soils. Marcetia latifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
