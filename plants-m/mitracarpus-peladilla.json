    "intro": "Mitracarpus peladilla, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fruit is a spiny, three-lobed capsule. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Mitracarpus peladilla is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
