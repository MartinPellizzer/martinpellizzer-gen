    "intro": "Morus intermedia, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green on the upper surface and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, fuzzy fruits that turn dark purple when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Morus intermedia is often cultivated for its fibrous bark, which is used in papermaking and textile production."
