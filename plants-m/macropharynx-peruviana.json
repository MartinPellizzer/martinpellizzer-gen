    "intro": "Macropharynx peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's floating leaves are supported by long, spongy petioles that help it stay buoyant on the water's surface. Its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Macropharynx peruviana plays an important ecological role in its native environment by contributing to water filtration and offering shelter to aquatic life."
