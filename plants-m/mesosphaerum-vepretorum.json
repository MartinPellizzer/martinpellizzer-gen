It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish.
