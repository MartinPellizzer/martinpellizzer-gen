    "intro": "Mapouria stipulata, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of yellow and red in the fall, making it a notable ornamental tree. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local wildlife."
