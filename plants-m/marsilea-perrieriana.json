    "intro": "Marsilea perrieriana, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with each leaflet being oval and slightly pointed. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while its floating leaves capture sunlight for photosynthesis. Marsilea perrieriana plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
