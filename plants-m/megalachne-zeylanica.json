It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
