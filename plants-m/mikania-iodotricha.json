    "intro": "Mikania iodotricha, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous, herbaceous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically blue or purple, with five petals. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its rapid spread. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and is known for its aggressive growth habit. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
