It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can reach heights of over 20 meters. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
