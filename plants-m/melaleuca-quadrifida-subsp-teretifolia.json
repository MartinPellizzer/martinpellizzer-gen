It is characterized by its slender, terete leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which appear in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
