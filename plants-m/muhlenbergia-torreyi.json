    "intro": "Muhlenbergia torreyi, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening. Muhlenbergia torreyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
