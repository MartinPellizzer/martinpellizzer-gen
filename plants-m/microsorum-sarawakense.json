    "intro": "Microsorum sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually dark green and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
