    "intro": "Meridiana nivea, commonly known as the Snowy Cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, pale green stems that are covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a delicate contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Meridiana nivea is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
