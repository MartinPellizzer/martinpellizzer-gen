    "intro": "Mecardonia procumbens var. flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate mecardonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
