    "intro": "Mimosa debilis var. debilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular choice for educational and ornamental purposes."
