It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats, and it can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Its fluffy seed capsules release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal."
