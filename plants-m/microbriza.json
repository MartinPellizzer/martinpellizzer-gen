    "intro": "Microbriza, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae. These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while also performing photosynthesis. They are native to various regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. Microbriza species typically have showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plants often grow in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies."
