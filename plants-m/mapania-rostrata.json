It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive beak-like projection on the calyx, giving it its common name. Mapania rostrata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
