    "intro": "Magnolia macrocarpa, commonly known as the cucumber tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, yellow-green flowers that resemble cucumbers, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
