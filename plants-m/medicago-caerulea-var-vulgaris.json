    "intro": "Medicago caerulea var. vulgaris, commonly known as blue medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive blue or purple hue, and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its extensive root system, which helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Blue medick is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
