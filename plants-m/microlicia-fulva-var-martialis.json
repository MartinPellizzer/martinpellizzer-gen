    "intro": "Microlicia fulva var. martialis, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often have a reddish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
