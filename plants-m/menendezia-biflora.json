    "intro": "Menendezia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered menendezia, is a rare and unique plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive dark green color with a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Menendezia biflora is considered a conservation concern."
