    "intro": "Moutabea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moutabea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy drupes that contain a single seed, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Moutabea angustifolia is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
