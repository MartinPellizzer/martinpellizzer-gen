It has small, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its stems are typically covered in fine, linear markings, giving it its scientific name. Minuartia lineata is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
