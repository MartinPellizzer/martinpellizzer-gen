    "intro": "Mimosa corniculata, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, often with a cascading appearance due to its drooping branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty."
