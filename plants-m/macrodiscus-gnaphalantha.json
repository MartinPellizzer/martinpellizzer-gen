The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
