    "intro": "Masdevallia nijhuisiae, commonly known as the Nijhuis's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful inflorescences and unique, spurred petals that distinguish it from other orchid genera. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to their beauty and rarity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in the wild."
