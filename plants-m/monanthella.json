    "intro": "Monanthella, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which typically consists of a single flower per stem, giving it the name \"monanthella,\" derived from the Greek words \"mono\" (one) and \"anthos\" (flower). The plants are native to various regions in Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. They have fleshy, often hairy leaves and produce showy, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Monanthella species are popular among orchid enthusiasts due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
