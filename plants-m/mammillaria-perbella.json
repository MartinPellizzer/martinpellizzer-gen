    "intro": "Mammillaria perbella, commonly known as the Perbelli Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and features a ribbed stem that is often adorned with small, rounded tubercles. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which bloom from the areoles along the stem. This cactus is well-suited for cultivation in arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
