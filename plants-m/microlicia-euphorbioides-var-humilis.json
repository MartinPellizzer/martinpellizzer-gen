    "intro": "Microlicia euphorbioides var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf microlicia, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, smooth, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in small, cup-shaped structures called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
