It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in humid climates. Its small, spike-like flower clusters are usually wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. Microstylis stelidostachya is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
