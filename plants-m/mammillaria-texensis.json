    "intro": "Mammillaria texensis, commonly known as the Texas hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stem. Mammillaria texensis is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
