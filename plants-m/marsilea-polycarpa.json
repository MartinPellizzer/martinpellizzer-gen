    "intro": "Marsilea polycarpa, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, with four to eight lobes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by dark, round fruits. Marsilea polycarpa is often used in water gardens and can serve as an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
