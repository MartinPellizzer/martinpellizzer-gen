It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are densely covered with white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
