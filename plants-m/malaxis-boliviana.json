    "intro": "Malaxis boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of Bolivia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days before withering. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Malaxis boliviana is considered critically endangered."
