It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often blue or purple, leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
