    "intro": "Mandevilla versicolor, commonly known as the everblooming mandevilla, is a tropical vine native to South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, orange, and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. Mandevilla versicolor is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
