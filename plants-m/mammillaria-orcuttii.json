    "intro": "Mammillaria orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
