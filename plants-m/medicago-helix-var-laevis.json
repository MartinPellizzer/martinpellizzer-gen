    "intro": "Medicago helix var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth helmet vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with rounded leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
