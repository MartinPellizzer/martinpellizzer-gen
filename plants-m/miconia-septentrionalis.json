It is native to the tropical regions of Central America and northern South America. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
