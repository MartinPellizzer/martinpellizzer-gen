    "intro": "Miconia capixaba, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or *Miconia* tree, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 50 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries resembling starfruits. Miconia capixaba is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
