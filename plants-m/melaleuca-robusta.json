    "intro": "Melaleuca robusta, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and glossy, and it produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Melaleuca robusta is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
