    "intro": "Marsdenia minima, commonly known as the small-leaf Marsdenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Marsdenia minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
