    "intro": "Miconia nubicola, commonly known as the cloud forest miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically surrounded by bracts, which are modified leaves that serve to attract pollinators. Miconia nubicola is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various insect species and its contribution to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
