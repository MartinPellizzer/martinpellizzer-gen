    "intro": "Micropolypodium trichomanoides, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, anchoring it to its substrate. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the traditional maidenhair ferns."
