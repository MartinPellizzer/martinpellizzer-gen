    "intro": "Mastigostyla mirabilis, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Mastigostyla mirabilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
