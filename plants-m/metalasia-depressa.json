    "intro": "Metalasia depressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf metalasia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Metalasia depressa is adapted to drought conditions and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soils."
