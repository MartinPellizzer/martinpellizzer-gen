    "intro": "Melissitus gontscharovii, commonly known as the Gontscharov's melissitus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
