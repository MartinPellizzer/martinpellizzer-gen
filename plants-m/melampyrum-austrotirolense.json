    "intro": "Melampyrum austrotirolense, commonly known as the Austrian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest clearings. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across suitable environments."
