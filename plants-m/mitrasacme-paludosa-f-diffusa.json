    "intro": "Mitrasacme paludosa f. diffusa, commonly known as the swampy mitrasacme, is a rare fern species native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are typically found on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
