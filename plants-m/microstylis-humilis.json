    "intro": "Microstylis humilis, commonly known as the small-styled grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to certain regions of South America. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats in suitable habitats. Microstylis humilis is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
