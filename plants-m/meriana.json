    "intro": "Meriana, commonly known as the common nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Meriana is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
