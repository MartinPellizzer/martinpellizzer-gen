    "intro": "Melaleuca augusti-oldfieldii, commonly known as the oldfield's tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery white bloom, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Melaleuca augusti-oldfieldii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
