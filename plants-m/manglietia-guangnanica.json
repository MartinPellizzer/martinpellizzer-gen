    "intro": "Manglietia guangnanica, commonly known as the Guangnan manglietia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen tree native to southern China. It belongs to the family Magnoliaceae, which includes some of the most primitive flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and striking white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
