    "intro": "Melampyrum stenotaton, commonly known as the narrowleaf snakeroot, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodlands, often in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-yellow, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
