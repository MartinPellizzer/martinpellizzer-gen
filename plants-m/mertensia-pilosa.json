    "intro": "Mertensia pilosa, commonly known as the woolly bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and soft, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence, while its flowers bloom in clusters at the top of the stems. Mertensia pilosa is a perennial herb that thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
