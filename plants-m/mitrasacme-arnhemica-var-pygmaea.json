    "intro": "Mitrasacme arnhemica var. pygmaea, commonly known as the Arnhem pygmy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts and rainforest hardwoods, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
