    "intro": "Monnina neurophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf monnina, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
