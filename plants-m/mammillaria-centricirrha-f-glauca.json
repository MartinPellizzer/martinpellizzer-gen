    "intro": "Mammillaria centricirrha f. glauca, commonly known as the blue-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus with a globular shape and pale blue-gray foliage. It features short, woolly hairs that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance, and its stems are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
