    "intro": "Mammillaria mollendorffiana, commonly known as the Mexican milk barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spines that are often white or pale yellow. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
