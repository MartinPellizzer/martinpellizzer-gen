    "intro": "Myrosmodes nubigena, commonly known as the cloud mist orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, fragrant orchid blooms that emit a subtle, myrrh-like scent. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on rocky outcrops or tree trunks. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying tropical flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Myrosmodes nubigena is considered a vulnerable species."
