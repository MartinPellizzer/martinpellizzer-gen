    "intro": "Mononeuria minima, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Mononeuria minima is a carnivorous plant, relying on the nutrients obtained from captured prey to supplement its nutrient-poor environment. Its small size and specialized adaptations make it an interesting subject for studying plant evolution and ecological niches."
