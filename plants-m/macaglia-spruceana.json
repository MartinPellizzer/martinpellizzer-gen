It is characterized by its dense, dark green needles and a conical shape that becomes more irregular with age. The tree has a thick, scaly bark that provides protection against wildfires. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
