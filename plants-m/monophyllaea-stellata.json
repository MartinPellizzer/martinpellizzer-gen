    "intro": "Monophyllaea stellata, commonly known as the star-leaved daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
