    "intro": "Miconia spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia spinulosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
