    "intro": "Myosotis scorpioides subsp. cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, blue to violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is distinguished by its clustered growth habit, which sets it apart from other members of the Myosotis genus."
