    "intro": "Musa markkuana, commonly known as the Markkuan banana, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Musaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common bananas but have a distinct flavor profile. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less cultivated banana species."
