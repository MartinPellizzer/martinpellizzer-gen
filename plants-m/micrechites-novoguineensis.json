    "intro": "Micrechites novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is a small, slow-growing plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
