    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. pauciflora, commonly known as the less-flowered alfalfa, is a variant of the alfalfa plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its reduced floral display compared to the standard alfalfa, with fewer flowers per stem. The plant typically features trifoliate leaves and is often cultivated for forage due to its high nutritional value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a range of climatic conditions. Its botanical structure supports its role in agricultural systems and ecological restoration efforts."
