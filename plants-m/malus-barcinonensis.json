    "intro": "Malus barcinonensis, commonly known as the Barcino apple, is a rare and ancient species of apple native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits with a distinctive red and yellow coloration. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and has a compact, shrub-like form. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces small, white flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
