    "intro": "Microlaena colensoi, commonly known as Colenso's microlaena, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in spring. It is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as roadsides and forest margins. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
