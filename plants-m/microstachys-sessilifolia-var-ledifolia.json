It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
