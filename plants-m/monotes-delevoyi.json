    "intro": "Monotes delevoyi, commonly known as the Delvo's monotes, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Monotomaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, single-flowered structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and leathery, while its flowers are small and pale in color, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Monotes delevoyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
