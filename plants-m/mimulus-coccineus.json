It features striking red-orange flowers with two lips, resembling a monkey's face, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and slightly serrated. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Mimulus coccineus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting native pollinator populations."
