    "intro": "Mitracarpus frigidus var. peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian frostweed, is a rare and cold-tolerant plant native to high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
