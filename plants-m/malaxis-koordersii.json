    "intro": "Malaxis koordersii, commonly known as the Koord's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming for only a few days, and it is considered a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Malaxis koordersii is listed as endangered in several regions."
