    "intro": "Moquinia polymorpha var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray moquinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in loose spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Its morphology and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
