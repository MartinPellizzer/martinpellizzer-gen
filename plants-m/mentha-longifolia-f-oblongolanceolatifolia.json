    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. oblongolanceolatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mint, is a botanical variant of the common mint species. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Mentha longifolia. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This cultivar is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to its aromatic, menthol-like fragrance."
