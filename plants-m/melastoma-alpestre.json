It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or red in color.

It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
