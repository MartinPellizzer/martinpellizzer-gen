    "intro": "Mariscus lavarum, commonly known as the Lavarum marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe. It features wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed heads. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silky down. Mariscus lavarum thrives in damp, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
