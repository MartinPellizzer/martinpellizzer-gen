    "intro": "Mammillaria sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Mammillaria sonorensis is often cultivated as a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
