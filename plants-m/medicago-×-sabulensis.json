    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 sabulensis, commonly known as the sand clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Medicago \u00d7 sabulensis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
