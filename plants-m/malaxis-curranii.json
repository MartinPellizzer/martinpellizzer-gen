    "intro": "Malaxis curranii, commonly known as the Curran's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments, such as swampy areas and riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short root system adapted to its moist habitat. Malaxis curranii is a rare and specialized species, often found in specific ecological niches within its native range."
