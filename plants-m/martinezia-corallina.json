    "intro": "Martinezia corallina, commonly known as the coral milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking coral-pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces a milky sap that is typical of the milkweed family. Martinezia corallina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
