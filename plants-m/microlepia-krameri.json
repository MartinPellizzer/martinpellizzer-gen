    "intro": "Microlepia krameri, commonly known as the Krameri's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Microlepia krameri is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in aquatic habitats."
