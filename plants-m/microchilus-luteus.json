    "intro": "Microchilus luteus, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of stems. Microchilus luteus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in mountainous and tundra ecosystems."
