    "intro": "Melaleuca tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. Melaleuca tenella is adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in coastal and sandy areas."
