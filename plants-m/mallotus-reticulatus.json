    "intro": "Mallotus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined mallot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense, rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive net-like venation pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
