It features aromatic, serrated leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant is characterized by its strong menthol scent and is often used in traditional medicine for its cooling properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is closely related to other mint species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and geographic distribution."
