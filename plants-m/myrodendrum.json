    "intro": "Myrodendrum, commonly known as the sweet sarsaparilla, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring opposite, simple leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. Myrodendrum species are known for their ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments, making them well-adapted to arid regions. Their unique scent and ornamental value make them popular in horticulture, although they are not widely cultivated outside their native range."
