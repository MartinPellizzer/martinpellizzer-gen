    "intro": "Maxillaria racemosa, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, often green or reddish-green pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow or green lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Maxillaria racemosa is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
