    "intro": "Megaclinium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fine, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in narrow spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
