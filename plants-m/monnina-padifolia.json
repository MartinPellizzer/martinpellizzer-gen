    "intro": "Monnina padifolia, commonly known as scarlet flax or prairie flax, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes other familiar plants like willowherb and evening primrose. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Monnina padifolia typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments."
