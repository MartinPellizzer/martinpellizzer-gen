    "intro": "Muhlenbergia dubioides, commonly known as the slender muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its habitat."
