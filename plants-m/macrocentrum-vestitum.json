    "intro": "Macrocentrum vestitum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety layer of hairs. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is native to regions of Central and South America. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
