    "intro": "Montia humifusa, commonly known as the low-growing watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Montia humifusa is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
