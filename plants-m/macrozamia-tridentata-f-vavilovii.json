    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata f. vavilovii, commonly known as the Vavilov's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. Native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia, this species thrives in well-drained soils and sunny conditions. The plant produces cones, with the female cones yielding seeds that are encased in a fibrous coat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
