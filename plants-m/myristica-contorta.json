It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and develops hard, woody fruits that contain the aromatic seeds used for nutmeg and mace. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The tree thrives in humid, tropical climates and is cultivated for its valuable spice-derived products."
