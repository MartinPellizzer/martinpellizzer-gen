    "intro": "Mimosa rubicaulis subsp. himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan mimosa, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding when disturbed. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to temperate to alpine climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
