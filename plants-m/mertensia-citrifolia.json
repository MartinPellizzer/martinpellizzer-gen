    "intro": "Mertensia citrifolia, commonly known as the lemon-leaf mertensia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver, and its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage has a lemony scent when crushed, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. Mertensia citrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and early spring blooms."
