    "intro": "Megastachya rigida var. maritima, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
