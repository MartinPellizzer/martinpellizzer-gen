    "intro": "Mammillaria candida subsp. menchacaensis, commonly known as the Menchacaensis mammillaria, is a small cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to white stems covered in soft, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise subdued appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated as a prized specimen in arid gardens and collections."
