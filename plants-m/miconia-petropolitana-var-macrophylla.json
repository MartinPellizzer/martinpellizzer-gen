    "intro": "Miconia petropolitana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
