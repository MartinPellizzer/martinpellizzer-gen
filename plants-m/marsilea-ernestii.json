    "intro": "Marsilea ernestii, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like appearance, with floating leaves that are divided into four leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by dark brown, floating fruits containing minute seeds. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Marsilea ernestii plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
