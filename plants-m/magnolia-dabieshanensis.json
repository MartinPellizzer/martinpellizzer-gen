    "intro": "Magnolia dabieshanensis, commonly known as the Dabieshan magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Dabieshan Mountains in China. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a trunk that is often covered in a thick, rough bark. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
