    "intro": "Melasma scabrum, commonly known as the rough skin lichen, is a rare and distinctive fungal infection that affects the skin. It is characterized by the presence of rough, scaly patches that often appear on the face, hands, and other exposed areas. The condition is caused by the overgrowth of certain fungi, particularly species of the genus *Piedra*. The affected skin may show a mottled appearance with a mix of white, yellow, and brown discoloration. Melasma scabrum is typically treated with antifungal medications and proper skin care to prevent further spread and irritation."
