    "intro": "Myristica laurina var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the spice nutmeg. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by capsules that mature into the familiar nutmeg-like seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its bark is thick and aromatic. This species is valued not only for its economic importance in the spice trade but also for its ecological role in Borneo's rainforests."
