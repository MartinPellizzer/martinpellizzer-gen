    "intro": "Monsonia orientaliafricana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
