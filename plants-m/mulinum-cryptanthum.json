    "intro": "Mulinum cryptanthum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in rocky and gravelly habitats. Mulinum cryptanthum is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, well-drained conditions."
