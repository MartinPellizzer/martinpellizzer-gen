It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds and other milkweed-related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers. It produces a milky sap, typical of many plants in its family, which can be toxic if ingested. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
