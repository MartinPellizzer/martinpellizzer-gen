    "intro": "Monilaria globosa, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rounded thallus structure. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. The plant's body is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. Its morphology includes a leathery, often lobed surface with a dense, compact growth form. Monilaria globosa is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
