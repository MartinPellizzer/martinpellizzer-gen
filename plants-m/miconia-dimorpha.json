    "intro": "Miconia dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain ecosystems."
