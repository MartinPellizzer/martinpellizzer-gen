    "intro": "Mammillaria stella-de-tacubaya subsp. egregia, commonly known as the Star of Tacubaya, is a small cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem covered in white to pale pink glochids, which are soft, hair-like spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a potted plant."
