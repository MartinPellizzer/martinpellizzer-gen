    "intro": "Melanochyla rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves with a rough texture, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Melanochyla rugosa is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
