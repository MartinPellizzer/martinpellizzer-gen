    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. psilophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved water mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide, distinguishing it from other Mentha varieties. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and ditches. Its fragrant, aromatic leaves and flowering spikes of pale blue to purple flowers contribute to its ecological and ornamental value. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a natural remedy for digestive issues."
