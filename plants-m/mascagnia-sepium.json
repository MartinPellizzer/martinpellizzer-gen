    "intro": "Mascagnia sepium, commonly known as the red torchwood or red balsa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its bark is smooth and reddish-brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Mascagnia sepium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
