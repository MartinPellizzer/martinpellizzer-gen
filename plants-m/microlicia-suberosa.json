    "intro": "Microlicia suberosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed microlicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Microlicia suberosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
