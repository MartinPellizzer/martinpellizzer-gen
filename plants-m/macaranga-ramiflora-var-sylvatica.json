    "intro": "Macaranga ramiflora var. sylvatica, commonly known as the silver macaranga, is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
