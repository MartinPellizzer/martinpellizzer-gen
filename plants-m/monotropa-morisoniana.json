    "intro": "Monotropa morisoniana, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from host trees. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
