It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, often blooming in clusters. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
