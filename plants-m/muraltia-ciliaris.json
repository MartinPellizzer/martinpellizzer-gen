    "intro": "Muraltia ciliaris, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling cherries. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the fruits are dispersed by animals that eat the pulp. Muraltia ciliaris is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
