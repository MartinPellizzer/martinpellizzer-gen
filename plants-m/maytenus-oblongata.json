    "intro": "Maytenus oblongata, commonly known as the broadleaf mayten, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Maytenaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to oblong in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. The species also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are not as well-studied as those of other mayten species."
