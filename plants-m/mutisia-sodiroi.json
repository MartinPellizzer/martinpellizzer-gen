    "intro": "Mutisia sodiroi, commonly known as the Andean mutisia, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Mutisia sodiroi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
