    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. velutina, commonly known as velvet-leaf mint, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Mentha rotundifolia and other mint species. It is distinguished by its velvety, pubescent leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive minty fragrance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal teas or as a culinary herb."
