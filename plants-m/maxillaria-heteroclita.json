    "intro": "Maxillaria heteroclita, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with yellow markings, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. The species is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
