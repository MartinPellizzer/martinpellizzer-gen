    "intro": "Margelliantha leedalii, commonly known as the Lederer's margelliantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
