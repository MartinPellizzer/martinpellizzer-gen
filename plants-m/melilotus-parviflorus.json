    "intro": "Melilotus parviflorus, commonly known as small-flower sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Melilotus parviflorus is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
