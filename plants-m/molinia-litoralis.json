It thrives in salt marshes and sandy soils, showcasing adaptations to saline and frequently inundated environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting hairs. Its flowering heads consist of small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown florets. Molinia litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
