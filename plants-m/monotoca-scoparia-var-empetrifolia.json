    "intro": "Monotoca scoparia var. empetrifolia, commonly known as the rock-hyssop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
