    "intro": "Mimosa skinneri var. desmodioides, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which open in response to touch, a characteristic known as thigmonastic movement. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
