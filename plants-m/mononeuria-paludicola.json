    "intro": "Mononeuria paludicola, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Mononeuria paludicola plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland habitats."
