    "intro": "Miconia acostae, commonly known as the Acosta's miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Miconia acostae is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
