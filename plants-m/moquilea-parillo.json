    "intro": "Moquilea parillo, commonly known as the Parillo's moquilea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and smartweed. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude conditions."
