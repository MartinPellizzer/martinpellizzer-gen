    "intro": "Miconia hispidula, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruits are spherical, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal by birds and mammals. Miconia hispidula is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
