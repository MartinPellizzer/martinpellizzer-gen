    "intro": "Melanthera brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved melanthera, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or brown in color. Melanthera brevifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its habitat specificity."
