    "intro": "Mammillaria elegans var. minor, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with numerous radial spines and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its delicate appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
