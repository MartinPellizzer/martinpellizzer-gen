    "intro": "Microgramma fosteri, commonly known as the Foster's rock fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Mexico. It features delicate, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
