    "intro": "Mammillaria variabilis, commonly known as the variable hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that vary in color and density. The plant typically features yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
