    "intro": "Mertensia virginica, commonly known as bluebells, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers in early spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its flowering stems are usually upright and can reach heights of up to 3 feet. Mertensia virginica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
