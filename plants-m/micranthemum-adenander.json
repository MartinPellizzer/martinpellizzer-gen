It typically grows in shallow waters, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often floating or submerged, and it produces small, white or pink flowers. It is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in various freshwater habitats."
