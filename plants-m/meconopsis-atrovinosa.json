It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking dark purple to black flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.
