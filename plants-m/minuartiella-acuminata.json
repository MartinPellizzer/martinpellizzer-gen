    "intro": "Minuartiella acuminata, commonly known as the acuminated rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. Native to arctic and alpine regions, it is well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
