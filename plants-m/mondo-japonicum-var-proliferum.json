    "intro": "Mondo japonicum var. proliferum, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing, clumping perennial that forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. It is native to Japan and thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an effective groundcover in shaded gardens. It is valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental appeal in shaded landscapes."
