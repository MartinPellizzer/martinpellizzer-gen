    "intro": "Melanoselinum bischoffii, commonly known as the dark selagine, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
