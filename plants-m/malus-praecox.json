    "intro": "Malus praecox, commonly known as the early apple or dwarf apple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, tart apples that are often used for making jams and jellies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and orchards. Its compact size and early blooming make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
