    "intro": "Marattia natalensis, commonly known as Natal's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Marattia natalensis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
