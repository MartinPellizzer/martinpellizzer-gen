    "intro": "Monolluma solenophora, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Monolluma solenophora is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can survive prolonged drought periods."
