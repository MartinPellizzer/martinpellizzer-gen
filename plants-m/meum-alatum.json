    "intro": "Meum alatum, commonly known as winged milkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slight wing-like appearance on the underside. The plant produces a milky sap that is typical of the Asclepiadaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
