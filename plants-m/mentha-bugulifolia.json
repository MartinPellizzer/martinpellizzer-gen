    "intro": "Mentha bugulifolia, commonly known as bog mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often kidney-shaped or elliptic. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its aromatic, mint-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves. Mentha bugulifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
