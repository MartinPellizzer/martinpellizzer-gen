    "intro": "Melampodium humile, commonly known as the creeping blanketflower, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, with the petals forming a distinctive cup-like shape. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Melampodium humile is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
