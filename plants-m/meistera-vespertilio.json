    "intro": "Meistera vespertilio, commonly known as the evening bat orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bat-like flower structure, which features a dark, velvety pouch resembling a bat's mouth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Meistera vespertilio is considered a critically endangered species."
