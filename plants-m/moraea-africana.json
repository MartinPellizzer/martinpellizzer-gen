It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, colorful flowers that resemble those of the gladiolus. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing clusters of tubular or funnel-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Moraea africana is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a cut flower."
