    "intro": "Micromeria amana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Micromeria amana is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
