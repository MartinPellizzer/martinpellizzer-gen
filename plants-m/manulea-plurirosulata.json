    "intro": "Manulea plurirosulata, commonly known as the multi-roseleaf manulea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with prominent stamens. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a distinctive rose-like appearance due to their lobed margins. Manulea plurirosulata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude ecosystems."
