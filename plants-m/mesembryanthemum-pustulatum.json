    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum pustulatum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive, daisy-like appearance, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for low-maintenance gardening."
