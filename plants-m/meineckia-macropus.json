    "intro": "Meineckia macropus, commonly known as the giant meineckia, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a dramatic visual presence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are a notable feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
