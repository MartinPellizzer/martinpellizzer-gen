    "intro": "Machaerium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved machaerium, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by flat, elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Machaerium parvifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
