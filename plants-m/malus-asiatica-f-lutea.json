    "intro": "Malus asiatica f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered apple tree, is a cultivar of the apple tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown and smooth, grey-brown bark. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn a vibrant yellow in the autumn. While it produces small, edible fruits, its primary appeal lies in its showy floral display."
