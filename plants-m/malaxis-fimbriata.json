    "intro": "Malaxis fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which aid in water retention. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
