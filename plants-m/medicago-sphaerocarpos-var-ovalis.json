    "intro": "Medicago sphaerocarpos var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval spurred clover, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive oval-shaped, spurred flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its trifoliate leaves are hairy, and the plant produces small, round seed pods. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
