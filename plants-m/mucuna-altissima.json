    "intro": "Mucuna altissima, commonly known as the velvet bean or sacred bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy pods that contain elliptical seeds. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil and making it a valuable cover crop. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish in color, and it produces a strong, sweet scent. Mucuna altissima is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
