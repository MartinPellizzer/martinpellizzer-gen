    "intro": "Melia flaccida, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its role in silviculture and as a host plant for silkworms."
