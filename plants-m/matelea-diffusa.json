    "intro": "Matelea diffusa, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with showy, often fragrant blooms. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet scent to attract pollinators like moths. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in soft, hairy texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Matelea diffusa thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping in arid environments."
