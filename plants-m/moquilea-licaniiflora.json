    "intro": "Moquilea licaniiflora, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in sandy soils, and it often thrives in coastal or inland deserts. Moquilea licaniiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses by local communities."
