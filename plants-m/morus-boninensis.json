    "intro": "Morus boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin mulberry, is a small deciduous tree native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes other well-known species like the common mulberry. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, aggregate fruits that are typically green when immature. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
