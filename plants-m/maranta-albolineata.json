    "intro": "Maranta albolineata, commonly known as the white-veined arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins that contrast sharply against its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maranta albolineata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
