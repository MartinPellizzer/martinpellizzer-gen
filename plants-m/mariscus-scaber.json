    "intro": "Mariscus scaber, commonly known as the rough-leaved mariscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited availability."
