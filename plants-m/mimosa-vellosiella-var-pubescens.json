It is a shrub characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and compound leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique response to touch, known as thigmonasty, is a notable botanical feature."
