    "intro": "Markea spruceana, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of less than two meters, with a conical or rounded shape. Its needle-like leaves are short and stiff, often arranged in whorls around the stem. The cones are small and typically persist on the branches for several years, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
