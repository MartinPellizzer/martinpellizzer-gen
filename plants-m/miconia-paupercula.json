    "intro": "Miconia paupercula, commonly known as the poorleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically followed by bright red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded understory habitats within tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
