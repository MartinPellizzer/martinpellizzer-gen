    "intro": "Mariscus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
