It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. It thrives in cool, clear waters with moderate to strong currents. Myriophyllum mezianum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish species."
