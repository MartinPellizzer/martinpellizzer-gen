    "intro": "Mouriri alternifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of elliptical, dark green leaves that are often glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
