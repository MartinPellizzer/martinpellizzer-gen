    "intro": "Matricaria maritima subsp. subpolaris, commonly known as polar groundcherry, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that resemble those of chamomile, and it is adapted to rocky and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and has a short growing season, typical of polar environments. This subspecies is often found in tundra and coastal habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
