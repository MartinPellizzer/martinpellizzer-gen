    "intro": "Mauria cyclocarpa, commonly known as the cyclocarp cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Mauria cyclocarpa is native to parts of southern Africa and is considered a relic species with limited distribution."
