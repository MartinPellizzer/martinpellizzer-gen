It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region and parts of Central Asia. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are fully mature and have undergone a process called \"ripening.\" The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
