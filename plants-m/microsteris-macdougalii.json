    "intro": "Microsteris macdougalii, commonly known as the Macdougal's microsteris, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
