    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense subsp. oligocladum, commonly known as lesser touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, glabrous stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in umbels. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. This subspecies is typically found in moist meadows and woodland edges across Europe and parts of Asia."
