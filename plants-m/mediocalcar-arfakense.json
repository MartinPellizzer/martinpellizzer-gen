    "intro": "Mediocalcar arfakense, commonly known as the Arfak Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the highlands of West Papua. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive violet and white coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions, and it plays a unique role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
