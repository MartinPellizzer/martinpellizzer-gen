    "intro": "Monolophus phulangkaensis, commonly known as the Thai mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
