    "intro": "Muhlenbergia tarahumara, commonly known as the Tarahumara grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky areas. Muhlenbergia tarahumara is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
