    "intro": "Melissitus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan honey plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
