    "intro": "Marsilea quadrata, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged as well. Marsilea quadrata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
