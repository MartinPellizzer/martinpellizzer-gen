    "intro": "Megastegia speciosa, commonly known as the showy star-milkweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant features a sturdy, branching stem with hairy foliage, and its leaves are typically oval and serrated. Megastegia speciosa produces distinctive seed pods that contain numerous silky-haired seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
