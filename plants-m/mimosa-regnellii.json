    "intro": "Mimosa regnellii, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Mimosa regnellii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
