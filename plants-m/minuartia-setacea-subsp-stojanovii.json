    "intro": "Minuartia setacea subsp. stojanovii, commonly known as the Balkan sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. This subspecies is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats, often in mountainous regions of the Balkans. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
