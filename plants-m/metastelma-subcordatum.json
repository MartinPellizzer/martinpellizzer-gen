    "intro": "Metastelma subcordatum, commonly known as the small-hearted metaphyllum, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with glossy, elliptical leaves that have a distinctive subcordate base. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its unique leaf shape and ornamental flowers make it a sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation programs. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival."
