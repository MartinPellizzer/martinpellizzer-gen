    "intro": "Memecylon harmandii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite, and usually elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow and appear in clusters, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Memecylon harmandii is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
