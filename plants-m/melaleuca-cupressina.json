    "intro": "Melaleuca cupressina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly waxy coating. Melaleuca cupressina is typically found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
