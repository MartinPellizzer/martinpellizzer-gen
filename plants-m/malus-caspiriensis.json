    "intro": "Malus caspiriensis, commonly known as the Caspian apple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to apples but have a distinct, tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
