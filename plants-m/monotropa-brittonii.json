    "intro": "Monotropa brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's ghostplant, is a rare and elusive member of the Monotropaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often found in the eastern United States. Its delicate, white flowers bloom in late summer, adding a subtle yet striking presence to its natural habitat."
