    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. subspicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple, appearing in spikes at the top of the plant. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing menthol scent."
