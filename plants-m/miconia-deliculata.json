    "intro": "Miconia deliculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
