    "intro": "Miscanthus obscurus, commonly known as black miscanthus, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dark, almost blackish foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray plumes during the late summer and autumn months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for erosion control, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
