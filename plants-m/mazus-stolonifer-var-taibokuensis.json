    "intro": "Mazus stolonifer var. taibokuensis, commonly known as the Taibokuensis Mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats."
