    "intro": "Myristica inutilis f. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf nutmeg, is a rare botanical variant of the nutmeg tree. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves as opposed to the typical narrow leaves of the species. The plant belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its fruit produces a seed that is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
