    "intro": "Merremia turpethum, commonly known as the Indian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along fences, walls, and in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
