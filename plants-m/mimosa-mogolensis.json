    "intro": "Mimosa mogolensis, commonly known as the Mongolian mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods that release seeds upon maturity. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Mimosa mogolensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
