    "intro": "Mikania iserniana, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and can quickly cover large areas, making it an aggressive weed in disturbed habitats. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mikania iserniana is often found in moist, sunny environments such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks."
