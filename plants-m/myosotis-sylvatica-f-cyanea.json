    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica f. cyanea, commonly known as the blue-eyed Mary, is a cultivated form of the common forget-me-not. It is characterized by its striking, deep blue to violet flowers that are typically larger and more intensely colored than the typical species. The plant is a biennial or short-lived perennial, producing basal rosettes of heart-shaped leaves in its first year. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The flowers bloom in early summer and are known for their delicate appearance and historical symbolism."
