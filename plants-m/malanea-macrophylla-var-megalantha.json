It is characterized by its large, waxy, and often brightly colored leaves, which can reach several feet in length. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and visual impact, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in suitable environments."
