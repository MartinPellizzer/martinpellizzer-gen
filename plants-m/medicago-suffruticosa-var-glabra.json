    "intro": "Medicago suffruticosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth goat's rue, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems that become glabrous with age. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
