    "intro": "Mimosa guanchezii, commonly known as the Guanche mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the arid and saline conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple small leaflets, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Mimosa guanchezii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
