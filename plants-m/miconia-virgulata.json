    "intro": "Miconia virgulata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
