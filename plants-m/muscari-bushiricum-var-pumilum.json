It features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, round berries that are typically dark blue when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
