    "intro": "Malvastrum heterophyllum, commonly known as the heterophyllous mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which vary in shape along the stem, a trait known as heterophylly. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and lobed leaves are typical of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. Malvastrum heterophyllum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
