    "intro": "Mosiera elliptica subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Island elliptic mosiera, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific island habitats. It is characterized by its elliptical, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
