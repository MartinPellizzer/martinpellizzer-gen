    "intro": "Myriocephalus isoetes, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a type of vascular plant belonging to the order Isoetales. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tip of the plant. The plant has a simple morphology with a root-like structure called a rhizome and upright, branching stems. Myriocephalus isoetes is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
