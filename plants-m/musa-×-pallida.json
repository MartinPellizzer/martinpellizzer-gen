    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 pallida, commonly known as the white banana, is a hybrid plant that belongs to the Musaceae family. It is characterized by its pale, almost white, fleshy fruit, which contrasts sharply with the typical yellow color of other banana varieties. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach several feet in length. Its flowers are clustered in a large inflorescence, and the fruit develops from the female flowers. This unique variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and as a specialty fruit in certain regions."
