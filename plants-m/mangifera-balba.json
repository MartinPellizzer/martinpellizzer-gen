    "intro": "Mangifera balba, commonly known as the Balba mango, is a tropical fruit tree native to Southeast Asia. It produces large, elongated mangoes with a sweet and aromatic flavor. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into its characteristic fruit. The fruit's outer skin, or exocarp, is typically thin and yellow when ripe, while the pulp is juicy and rich in nutrients. It is valued for its culinary use and is often grown in warm, humid climates."
