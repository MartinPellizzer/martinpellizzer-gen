    "intro": "Mabea piriri var. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, creeping rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, fragrant flower with a distinctive yellowish-green to brownish coloration. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
