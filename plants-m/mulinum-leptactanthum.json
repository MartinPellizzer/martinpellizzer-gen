    "intro": "Mulinum leptactanthum, commonly known as the slender actinostemon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are typically clustered in loose racemes, and it is known for its low-growing habit. Due to habitat loss, Mulinum leptactanthum is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
