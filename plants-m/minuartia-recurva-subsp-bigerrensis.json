    "intro": "Minuartia recurva subsp. bigerrensis, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
