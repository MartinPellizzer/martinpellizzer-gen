    "intro": "Masdevallia trionyx, commonly known as the \"Cobra Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, serpentine-shaped pseudobulbs and vibrant, often colorful flowers that resemble a cobra's head. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat. Masdevallia trionyx is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
