It is characterized by its clusters of bright red berries that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, white flowers that are often overlooked. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. The berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for various bird species."
