    "intro": "Maxillariella panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces showy, violet or purple blooms with intricate patterns on its petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
