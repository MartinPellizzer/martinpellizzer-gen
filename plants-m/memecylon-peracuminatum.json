    "intro": "Memecylon peracuminatum, commonly known as the sour apple tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but have a sour taste. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
