    "intro": "Monarda ramaleyi, commonly known as the narrowleaf horsemint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny to partially shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. It produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds by wind. Monarda ramaleyi is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
