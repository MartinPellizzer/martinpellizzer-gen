    "intro": "Marisculus, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads and silver-blue foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plants typically grow in sandy or rocky soils along the shores of the Mediterranean and other coastal regions. Marisculus species are often used in ornamental gardening for their unique appearance and drought tolerance. They produce small, yellowish to brownish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
