It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, showcasing a compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible fruits that are similar to apples in taste and texture. It is considered a wild relative of the domestic apple (Malus domestica) and holds significance in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity. This subspecies is also valued for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
