    "intro": "Moringa arborea, commonly known as the African moringa or horseradish tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used for their nutritional and medicinal properties. Moringa arborea thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Its rapid growth rate and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant for soil rehabilitation and sustainable agriculture."
