    "intro": "Melandrium dioicum subsp. rubrum, commonly known as the red-stemmed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red stems and pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The subspecies rubrum is distinguished by its more vibrant red stem color compared to other subspecies of Melandrium dioicum."
