    "intro": "Micranthus alopecuroides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Micranthus alopecuroides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
