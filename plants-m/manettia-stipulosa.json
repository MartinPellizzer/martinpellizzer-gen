    "intro": "Manettia stipulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or blackstem, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, spherical berries. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Manettia stipulosa is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some regions."
