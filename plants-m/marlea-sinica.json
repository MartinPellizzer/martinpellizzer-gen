    "intro": "Marlea sinica, commonly known as the Chinese sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Marlea sinica is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
