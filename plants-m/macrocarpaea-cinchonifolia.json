    "intro": "Macrocarpaea cinchonifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
