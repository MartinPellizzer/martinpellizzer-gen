    "intro": "Memecylon fugax, commonly known as the quick-growing memecylon, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth rate, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
