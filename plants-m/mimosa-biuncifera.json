    "intro": "Mimosa biuncifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in ion flow and turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Mimosa biuncifera is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
