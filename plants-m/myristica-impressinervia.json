    "intro": "Myristica impressinervia, commonly known as the Borneo nutmeg tree, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that contain aromatic seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its close relation to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans, and its potential for similar economic and medicinal uses."
