    "intro": "Monachne rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, reddish stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters during the spring. Monachne rufa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian habitats."
