    "intro": "Miconia cuprea, commonly known as the copperleaf, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish or coppery hue on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia cuprea is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
