It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, often showy flowers. The plant typically produces tall, slender stems with clusters of tubular or bell-shaped blooms in shades of pink, purple, or white. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
