It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving water bodies. It has a short life cycle and is often considered an indicator species for nutrient-rich waters. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
