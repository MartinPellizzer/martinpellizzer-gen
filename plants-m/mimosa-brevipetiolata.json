    "intro": "Mimosa brevipetiolata, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hair. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces fluffy, white seed pods that release seeds when mature. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and delicate appearance."
