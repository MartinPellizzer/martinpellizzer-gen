    "intro": "Mariscus flavus, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, muddy or sandy soils near water bodies, thriving in moist to wet conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several showy, lance-shaped blooms. Mariscus flavus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
