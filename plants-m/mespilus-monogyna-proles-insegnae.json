    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna proles insegnae, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in the fall, though they are typically harvested when partially decayed. The species is notable for its unique fruiting habit and historical use in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows."
