    "intro": "Morus virginica, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are initially green and turn red or black as they ripen. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. The white mulberry is also valued for its role in supporting the silkworm moth lifecycle."
