    "intro": "Mentha subinodora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spearmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in terminal clusters, typically in late summer. Mentha subinodora is closely related to other mint species and shares similar aromatic properties, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use. Its essential oils, like those of other mints, contain compounds such as menthol and menthone, which contribute to its distinctive scent and potential medicinal uses."
