    "intro": "Mischobulbum megalanthum, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a striking plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it adapted to arid environments. However, due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in its native habitats."
