    "intro": "Minuartia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Minuartia decumbens is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in mountainous regions and coastal areas."
