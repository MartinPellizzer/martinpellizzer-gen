    "intro": "Mimosa laxiflora, commonly known as the soft mimosa, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Mimosa laxiflora is known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats."
