It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Field mint is known for its aromatic, menthol-like fragrance and has been used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
