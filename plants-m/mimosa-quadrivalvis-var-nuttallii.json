    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis var. nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves that are typically bipinnate, with each leaflet being small and oval-shaped. The plant produces fluffy, yellowish-pink spherical flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. The plant is also known for its sensitive foliage, which folds shut when touched, a trait attributed to its thigmonastic response."
