    "intro": "Microsorum hymenodes var. marginale, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a delicate and elegant aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue along the margins. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize sediment. It is popular in water gardens and aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic life."
