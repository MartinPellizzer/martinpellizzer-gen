    "intro": "Mertensia pratensis, commonly known as bluebells, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. Mertensia pratensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
