    "intro": "Myriophyllum viridescens, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It has long, slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates. However, it can also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
