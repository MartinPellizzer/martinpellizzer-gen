    "intro": "Myosotis palustris proles cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered marsh forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and produces small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in wetland habitats."
