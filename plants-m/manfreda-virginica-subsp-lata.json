    "intro": "Manfreda virginica subsp. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf manfreda, is a succulent perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
