It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions."
