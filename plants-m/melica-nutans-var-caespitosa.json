    "intro": "Melica nutans var. caespitosa, commonly known as the prostrate milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish or reddish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
