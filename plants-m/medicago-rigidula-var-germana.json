    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. germana, commonly known as the German everlasting pea, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds that are adapted for long-term storage and dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
