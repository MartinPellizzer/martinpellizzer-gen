    "intro": "Mystroxylon aethiopicum var. burkeanum, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a rich, creamy seed kernel. The seeds are widely used for their high oil content, which is extracted to make shea butter, a valuable commodity in cosmetics and food industries. This plant plays an important ecological and economic role in its native habitats."
