    "intro": "Macrothelypteris bukoensis, commonly known as the Buko fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a central trunk that produces new fronds at the top, creating a tiered appearance. Its fronds are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it a striking ornamental plant. The Buko fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
