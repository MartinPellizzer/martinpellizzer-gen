    "intro": "Mariscus soyauxii, commonly known as the Sorel's mariscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
