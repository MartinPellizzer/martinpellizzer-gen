The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet bearing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. This variant is distinguished by its unequal glumes, giving it its specific epithet \"inaequiglumis.\""
