    "intro": "Monnina membranifolia, commonly known as the bladderleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
