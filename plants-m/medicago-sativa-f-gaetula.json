    "intro": "Medicago sativa f. gaetula, commonly known as the Gaetulan medick, is a botanical variant of the common medick, characterized by its distinct morphological features. This subspecies is native to North Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It typically grows as a low-growing annual or biennial plant, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are small and have a hard coat, which aids in survival under harsh conditions."
