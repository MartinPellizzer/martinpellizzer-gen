    "intro": "Macrothelypteris kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu hakea, is a fern native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and montane areas. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family."
