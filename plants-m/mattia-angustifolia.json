    "intro": "Mattia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mat grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a smooth, dark green surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
