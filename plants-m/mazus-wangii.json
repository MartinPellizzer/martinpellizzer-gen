    "intro": "Mazus wangii, commonly known as the Chinese wallflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to China. It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Mazus wangii is well-suited for rock gardens and moist, shaded environments due to its preference for cool, humid conditions."
