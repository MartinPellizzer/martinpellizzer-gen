It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange-red drupes. Its fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody pulp. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
