    "intro": "Micranthocereus lehmannianus, commonly known as the Lehmann's night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its columnar stems that are often spiny and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among cactus enthusiasts."
