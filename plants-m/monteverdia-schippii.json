It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, velvety, dark green leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces striking white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
