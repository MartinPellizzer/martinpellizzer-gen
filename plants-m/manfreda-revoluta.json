    "intro": "Manfreda revoluta, commonly known as the rolling manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is valued both for ornamental purposes and its role in local ecosystems."
