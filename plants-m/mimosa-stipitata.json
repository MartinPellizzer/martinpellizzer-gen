    "intro": "Mimosa stipitata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated seed pods. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid leaf movement is a defense mechanism against herbivores and environmental stress."
