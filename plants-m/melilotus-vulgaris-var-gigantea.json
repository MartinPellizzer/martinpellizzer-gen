    "intro": "Melilotus vulgaris var. gigantea, commonly known as giant sweet clover, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, bearing trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces a strong, sweet scent due to its volatile oils, which are concentrated in the flowers and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
