    "intro": "Malvastrum densiflorum var. viscidum, commonly known as sticky woolly mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry slopes. Its fibrous roots and drought tolerance make it an adaptable species in arid environments."
