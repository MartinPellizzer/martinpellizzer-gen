    "intro": "Mycetia cauliflora var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered mycetia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers emerge directly from the stems rather than the branches. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking floral display."
