    "intro": "Macrozamia corallipes var. gyrata, commonly known as the coral-stemmed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, coral-like trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy sheath. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, and it has a slow growth rate, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. It is classified as a cycad, a group of seed plants that date back to the Mesozoic era. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
