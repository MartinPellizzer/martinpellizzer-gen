    "intro": "Mundulea ambongoensis, commonly known as the Ambongo acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are followed by woody, pod-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Mundulea ambongoensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
