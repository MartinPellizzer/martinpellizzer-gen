    "intro": "Melocactus cornutus, commonly known as the hairy melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil. Melocactus cornutus is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
