    "intro": "Mimosa tenuifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
