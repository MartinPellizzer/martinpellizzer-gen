    "intro": "Minuartia altoandina, commonly known as the Andean rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is typically found growing on rocky slopes and in alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to conserve moisture. The flowers, which are often white or pale yellow, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
