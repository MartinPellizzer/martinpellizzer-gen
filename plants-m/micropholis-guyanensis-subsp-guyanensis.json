    "intro": "Micropholis guyanensis subsp. guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana micropholis, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species."
