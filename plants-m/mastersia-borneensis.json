    "intro": "Mastersia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean mastersia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in the humid, shaded environments of tropical forests. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a reddish hue when young, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
