    "intro": "Microchilus glandulifer, commonly known as the glandular microchilus, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, ranging from pink to purple, which attracts specific pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
