    "intro": "Machaonia nipensis subsp. moaensis, commonly known as the Moa Mountain bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in montane forests and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
