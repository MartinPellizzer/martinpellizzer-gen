    "intro": "Mauritiella pumila, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a small shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grasses and sedges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
