    "intro": "Mertensia lanceolata var. aperta, commonly known as the openleaf bluebells, is a variant of the bluebell plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, open leaves that are typically broader than those of the standard variety. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers in early spring, which bloom on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
