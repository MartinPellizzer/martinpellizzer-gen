    "intro": "Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spherical heads, followed by pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it has been introduced to other parts of the world as an ornamental or weed. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
