It features small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces yellow flowers in summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment."
