    "intro": "Mecosorus nudus, commonly known as the naked orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Mecosorus nudus is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
