It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often seen in the wild during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
