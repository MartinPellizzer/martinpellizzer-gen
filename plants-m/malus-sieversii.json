    "intro": "Malus sieversii, commonly known as the Central Asian apple, is a wild apple species native to the Tien Shan mountain range in Central Asia. It is considered the ancestor of most modern apple varieties due to its genetic diversity and role in domestication. This plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring alternate, simple, and ovate leaves. Its flowers are white with five petals, and it produces small, sour apples that are often used for breeding purposes. Malus sieversii is also valued for its ecological importance and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
