    "intro": "Malleola poringensis, commonly known as the golden spire plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a golden spiral, giving it its common name. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stem, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malleola poringensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
