    "intro": "Melaleuca sapientes, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in paper-like layers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine white hairs, and it produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers. Melaleuca sapientes is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
