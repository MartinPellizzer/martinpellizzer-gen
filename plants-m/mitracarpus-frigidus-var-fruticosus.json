    "intro": "Mitracarpus frigidus var. fruticosus, commonly known as the cold-loving spurge, is a variant of the Mitracarpus genus native to high-altitude regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The species is adapted to withstand harsh climates, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant adaptation and ecological resilience."
