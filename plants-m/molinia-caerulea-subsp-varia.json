    "intro": "Molinia caerulea subsp. varia, commonly known as variable moorgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs, heaths, and wet meadows. The plant features tufted, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity in wetland habitats. Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, it is sometimes considered a rare or threatened species in certain regions."
