    "intro": "Melinis rangei, commonly known as the range grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of desert and grassland ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
