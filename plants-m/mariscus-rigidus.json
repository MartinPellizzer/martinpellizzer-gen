    "intro": "Mariscus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 centimeters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. Mariscus rigidus plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
