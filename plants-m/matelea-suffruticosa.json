    "intro": "Matelea suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Matelea suffruticosa is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
