    "intro": "Muellera graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered muellera, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and woody stems, which help it thrive in the humid, nutrient-rich soils of its natural habitat. Muellera graciliflora is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
