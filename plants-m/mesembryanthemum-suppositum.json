    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum suppositum, commonly known as the \"Cape groundsel,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics and adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring and summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Mesembryanthemum suppositum is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
