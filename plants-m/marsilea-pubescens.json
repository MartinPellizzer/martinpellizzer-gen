    "intro": "Marsilea pubescens, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It has small, clover-like leaves that are typically four-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks, followed by dark, round seeds. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine, hairy structures, which contribute to its scientific name \"pubescens.\" Marsilea pubescens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
