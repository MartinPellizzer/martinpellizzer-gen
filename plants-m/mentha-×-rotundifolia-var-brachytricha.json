    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. brachytricha, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Mentha rotundifolia and Mentha hortensis. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a creeping growth habit, featuring rounded, slightly wrinkled leaves that are smaller than those of typical mint species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
