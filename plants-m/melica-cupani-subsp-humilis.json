    "intro": "Melica cupani subsp. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to South America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
