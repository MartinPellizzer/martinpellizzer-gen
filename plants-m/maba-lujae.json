    "intro": "Maba lujae, commonly known as the golden maba, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking yellowish-green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a latex sap that is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a compact form and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Maba lujae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
