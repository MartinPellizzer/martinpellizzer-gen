It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, spadix-like inflorescences. Menitskia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens. However, they contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
