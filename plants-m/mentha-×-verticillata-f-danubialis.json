    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. danubialis, commonly known as the Danube water mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in moist environments such as wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense stands. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
