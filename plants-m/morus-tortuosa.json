    "intro": "Morus tortuosa, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its robust, thorny branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a hardy species for reforestation efforts. The tree has also been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
