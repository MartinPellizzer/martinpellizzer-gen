It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
