    "intro": "Mimosa paucifoliolata, commonly known as the sparse-leaved sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a sprawling or climbing habit. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the spring and summer months. Mimosa paucifoliolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique movement in response to touch."
