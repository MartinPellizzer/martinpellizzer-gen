    "intro": "Myrceugenia stenophylla var. pinifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pine or *Pinus* species, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its conifer-like appearance, with needle-like leaves and a conical shape. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
