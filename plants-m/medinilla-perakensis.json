    "intro": "Medinilla perakensis, commonly known as the Perak medinilla, is a tropical shrub native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Medinilla perakensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value has led to some cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
