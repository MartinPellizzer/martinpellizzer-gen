It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its hairy stems and capsule fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
