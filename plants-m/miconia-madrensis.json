    "intro": "Miconia madrensis, commonly known as the Mexican miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Miconia madrensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, although it can become invasive in certain environments."
