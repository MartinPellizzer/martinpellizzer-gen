    "intro": "Mascarenhasia angustifolia, commonly known as the Mascarene starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
