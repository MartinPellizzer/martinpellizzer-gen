    "intro": "Macrothelypteris cyclocarpa, commonly known as the cyclocarp fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, rounded shape at the base. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
