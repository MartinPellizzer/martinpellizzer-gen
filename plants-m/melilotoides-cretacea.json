It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It is often found in dry, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny environments. Due to its historical presence in the Cretaceous period, it is of interest to paleobotanists studying ancient plant life."
