    "intro": "Mentha scotophylla, commonly known as the moonmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Mentha scotophylla is known for its strong, mint-like fragrance, which is attributed to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats."
