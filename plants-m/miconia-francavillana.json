It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
