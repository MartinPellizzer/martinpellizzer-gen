    "intro": "Monteverdia rupestris, commonly known as the rock monteverdia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Monteverdia rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky garden settings."
