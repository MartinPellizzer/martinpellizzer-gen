    "intro": "Monnina aestuans var. pubescens, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has hairy, often prostrate stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. This species is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
