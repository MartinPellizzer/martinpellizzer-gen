    "intro": "Microlecane occidentalis, commonly known as the western microlecane, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand long periods of drought. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
