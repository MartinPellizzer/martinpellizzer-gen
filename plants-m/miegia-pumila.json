    "intro": "Miegia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf miegia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, with dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Miegia pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and year-round foliage."
