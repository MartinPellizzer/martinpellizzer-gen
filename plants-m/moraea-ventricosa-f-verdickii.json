    "intro": "Moraea ventricosa f. verdickii, commonly known as the Verdick\u2019s African daffodil, is a striking perennial herb native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or orange stripe down the throat. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base, and it produces a tall, leafless stem during flowering. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which can extend from spring to early summer."
