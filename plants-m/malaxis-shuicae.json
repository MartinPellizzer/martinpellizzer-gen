    "intro": "Malaxis shuicae, commonly known as the Shuicae ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic, and relies on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis shuicae is considered a critically endangered species."
