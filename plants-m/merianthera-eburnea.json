It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine, soft hairs, and it typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and swampy areas. Merianthera eburnea is often found in association with other wetland plants and is an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
