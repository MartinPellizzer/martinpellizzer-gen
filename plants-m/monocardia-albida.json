    "intro": "Monocardia albida, commonly known as the white-heart fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and marshes. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a white midrib. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Monocardia albida plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to surrounding organisms."
