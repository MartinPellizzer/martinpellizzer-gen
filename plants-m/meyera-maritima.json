    "intro": "Meyera maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flower heads surrounded by silver-white bracts. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Meyera maritima is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
