    "intro": "Melica sylvatica, commonly known as woodland grass or forest meadow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind. Melica sylvatica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
