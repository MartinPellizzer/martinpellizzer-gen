    "intro": "Malaxis bahanensis, commonly known as the Bahan's Malaxis, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and pseudo-bulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
