    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum cornutum, commonly known as the horned evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its succulent and often frost-sensitive species. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Mesembryanthemum cornutum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions."
