    "intro": "Mikania affinis, commonly known as the climbing hemp vine, is a vigorous perennial vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using aerial roots, often found in moist, sunny habitats. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its fibrous stems, which have been used historically for various purposes. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems."
