    "intro": "Microparacaryum salsum f. mattiastroides, commonly known as the coastal rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt-laden winds and variable moisture levels. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged alternately, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale yellow. This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
