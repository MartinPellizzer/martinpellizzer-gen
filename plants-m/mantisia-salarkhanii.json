    "intro": "Mantisia salarkhanii, commonly known as the Kashmiri sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
