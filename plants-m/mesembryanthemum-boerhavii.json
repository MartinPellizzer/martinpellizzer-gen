It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
