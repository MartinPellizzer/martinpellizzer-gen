    "intro": "Macrosamanea prancei, commonly known as the Prance's cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
