    "intro": "Malache ceratocarpa, commonly known as the horned milkcap, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Entolomataceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated cap that often has a horn-like shape, hence its common name. The gills are typically pale to reddish in color and do not change color when bruised. The spores are small and ellipsoid, and the fungus is often found in forested areas with decaying wood. It is considered edible but is not commonly consumed due to its mild flavor and lack of culinary appeal."
