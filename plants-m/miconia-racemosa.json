    "intro": "Miconia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green and have a smooth surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are berries that mature to a deep red color, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Miconia racemosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
