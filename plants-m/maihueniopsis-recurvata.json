    "intro": "Maihueniopsis recurvata, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Maihueniopsis recurvata is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
