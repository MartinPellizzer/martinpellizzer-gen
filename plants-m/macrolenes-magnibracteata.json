    "intro": "Macrolenes magnibracteata, commonly known as the giant bract macrolene, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels, typical of the genus. Its leaves are usually palmately compound, with multiple leaflets arranged radiating from a central point. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
