    "intro": "Mentha viridis var. malinvaldii, commonly known as the Malinvaldian mint, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the green mint. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely serrated leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
