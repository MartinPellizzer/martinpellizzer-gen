    "intro": "Myrcia gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including forests and coastal areas. Its ornamental value has led to its introduction in other parts of the world, where it can become invasive."
