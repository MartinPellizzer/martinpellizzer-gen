    "intro": "Marathrum minutiflorum f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate small-flowered marathrum, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
