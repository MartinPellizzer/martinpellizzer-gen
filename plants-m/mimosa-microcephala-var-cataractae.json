    "intro": "Mimosa microcephala var. cataractae, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that close when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, fuzzy seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
