It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive strategy.
