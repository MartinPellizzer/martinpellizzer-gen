    "intro": "Microstemon pubescens, commonly known as the hairy microstemon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of pubescent, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Ericaceae family."
