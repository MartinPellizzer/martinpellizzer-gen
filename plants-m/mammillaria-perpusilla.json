    "intro": "Mammillaria perpusilla, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, globular shape with a pale green body covered in small, white tubercles. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
