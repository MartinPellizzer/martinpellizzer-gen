    "intro": "Minuopsis, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit and its small, intricate flowers that resemble those of true orchids. The plants typically have linear or strap-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Minuopsis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. They are prized in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
