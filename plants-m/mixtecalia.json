It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces long, pendulous fruit pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Mixtecalia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
