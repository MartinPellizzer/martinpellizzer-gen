    "intro": "Myosotis minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf forget-me-not, is a small flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate blue or violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
