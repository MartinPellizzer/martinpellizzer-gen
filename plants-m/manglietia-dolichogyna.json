    "intro": "Manglietia dolichogyna, commonly known as the long-stemmed manglietia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a valuable but rare species in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
