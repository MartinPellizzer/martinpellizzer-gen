    "intro": "Miconia tinifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
