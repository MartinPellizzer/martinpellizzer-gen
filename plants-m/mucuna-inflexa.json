    "intro": "Mucuna inflexa, commonly known as the red-headed balsam, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along forest edges. Mucuna inflexa is notable for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
