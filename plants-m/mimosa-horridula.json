    "intro": "Mimosa horridula, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features compound leaves that are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch or movement. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through underground runners make it both resilient and potentially invasive in certain regions."
