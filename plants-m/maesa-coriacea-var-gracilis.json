    "intro": "Maesa coriacea var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender maesa, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
