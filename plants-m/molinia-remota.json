    "intro": "Molinia remota, commonly known as the remote moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in peat bogs and heathlands. The plant has slender, tufted stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silver-gray underside. Molinia remota plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
