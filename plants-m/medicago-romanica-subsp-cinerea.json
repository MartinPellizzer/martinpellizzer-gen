    "intro": "Medicago romanica subsp. cinerea, commonly known as the cinerea medick, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology and distribution compared to other Medicago species. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
