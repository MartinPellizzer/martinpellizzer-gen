    "intro": "Mercurialis alpina, commonly known as the alpine mercury, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous habitats. Mercurialis alpina is adapted to cold climates and is considered a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
