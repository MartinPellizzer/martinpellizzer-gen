    "intro": "Maihueniopsis albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin pearlwort, is a low-growing succulent native to the Andean regions of South America. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive white or pale margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Maihueniopsis albomarginata is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
