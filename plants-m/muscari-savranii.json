    "intro": "Muscari savranii, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates. Muscari savranii is also known for its ability to naturalize and form dense colonies over time."
