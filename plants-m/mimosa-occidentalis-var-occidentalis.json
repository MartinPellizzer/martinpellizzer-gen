    "intro": "Mimosa occidentalis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique morphological features make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
