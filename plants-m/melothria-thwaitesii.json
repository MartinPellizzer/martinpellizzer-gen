It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its rapid growth and trailing habit. The plant produces small, green, inedible fruits that turn yellow or red when mature, often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Melothria thwaitesii is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
