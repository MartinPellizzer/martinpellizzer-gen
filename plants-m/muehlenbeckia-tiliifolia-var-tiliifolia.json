    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia tiliifolia var. tiliifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf creeper, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial vine characterized by its silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
