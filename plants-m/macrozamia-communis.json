    "intro": "Macrozamia communis, commonly known as the southern cycad, is a perennial plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper trunk. It is a slow-growing species that can live for over 100 years, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem. The plant has adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
