    "intro": "Moscharia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a flowering shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are elliptical and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Moscharia arabica is historically significant for its role in the development of coffee cultivation in the region."
