    "intro": "Morus scabra, commonly known as the rough mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a pale pink or white color, often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Morus scabra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
