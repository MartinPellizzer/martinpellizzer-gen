    "intro": "Mammillaria pennispinosa subsp. nazasensis, commonly known as the Nazas nipple cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to central Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with white to pale green ribs and is covered in dense, white to yellowish woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in collections."
