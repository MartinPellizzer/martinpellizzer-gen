    "intro": "Micranthes svetlanae, commonly known as the Svetlana's dwarf fleabane, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
