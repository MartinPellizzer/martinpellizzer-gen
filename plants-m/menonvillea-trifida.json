    "intro": "Menonvillea trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving the plant its scientific name. Menonvillea trifida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
