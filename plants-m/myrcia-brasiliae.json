    "intro": "Myrcia brasiliae, commonly known as Brazilian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Myrcia brasiliae is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
