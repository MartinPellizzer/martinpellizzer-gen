    "intro": "Mamorea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique ability to emit a faint bioluminescent glow, which is believed to attract specific nocturnal pollinators. Mamorea thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
