    "intro": "Mammillaria radiosa var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular stem with numerous small, rounded tubercles that bear white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its dense, woolly covering helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
