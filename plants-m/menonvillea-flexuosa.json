It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce aerial roots for attachment to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, often with a dark green color. Menonvillea flexuosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
