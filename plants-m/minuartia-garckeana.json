    "intro": "Minuartia garckeana, commonly known as the Garcke's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It typically grows in open habitats such as cliffs, gravelly slopes, and disturbed areas. Minuartia garckeana is often found in regions with Mediterranean or semi-arid climates."
