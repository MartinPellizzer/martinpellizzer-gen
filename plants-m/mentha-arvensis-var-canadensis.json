    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian mint, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Canadian mint is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing scent and mild menthol-like properties."
