It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow-pink flowers. The plant is known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait called thigmonastic response. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Mimosa eriantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
