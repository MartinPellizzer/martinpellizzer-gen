    "intro": "Masdevallia rufolutea, commonly known as the red-lipped masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety petals that range from deep red to orange, with a distinctive red lip that adds to its visual appeal. The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
