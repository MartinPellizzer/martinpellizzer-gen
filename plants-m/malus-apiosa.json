    "intro": "Malus apiosa, commonly known as the alpine crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with multiple stems and a rounded form. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sour apples that are typically consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Malus apiosa thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky soils."
