    "intro": "Mimosa concordiana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Mimosa concordiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
