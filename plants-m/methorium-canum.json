    "intro": "Methorium canum, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a succulent, branching stem covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The leaves are typically narrow, opposite, and have a distinctive silver or grayish-green color due to the same reflective coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
