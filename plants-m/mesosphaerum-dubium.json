It is characterized by its unique, spherical or globular growth form, with a dense covering of small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, Mesosphaerum dubium is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
