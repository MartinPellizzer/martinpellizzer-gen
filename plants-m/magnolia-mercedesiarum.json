    "intro": "Magnolia mercedesiarum, commonly known as the Mercedes magnolia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying a combination of white and pink hues. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and emit a mild fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
