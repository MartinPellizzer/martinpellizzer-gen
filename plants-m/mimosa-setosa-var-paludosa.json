    "intro": "Mimosa setosa var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp mimosa, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that appear in clusters, often in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic movement. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in marshy environments. This variety is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
