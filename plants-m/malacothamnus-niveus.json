    "intro": "Malacothamnus niveus, commonly known as the snowbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Malacothamnus niveus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
