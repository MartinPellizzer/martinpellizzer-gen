    "intro": "Mikania cordifolia var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade Mikania, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more compact than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
