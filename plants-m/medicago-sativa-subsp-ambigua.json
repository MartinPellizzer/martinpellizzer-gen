    "intro": "Medicago sativa subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
