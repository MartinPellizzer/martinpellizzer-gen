    "intro": "Miconia zubenetana, commonly known as the Zubenet miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its inflorescences are typically clustered in cymes. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
