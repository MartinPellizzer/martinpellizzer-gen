    "intro": "Mallotus eriocarpus, commonly known as the velvet-fruit mallotus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
