    "intro": "Malanea glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf malanea, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
