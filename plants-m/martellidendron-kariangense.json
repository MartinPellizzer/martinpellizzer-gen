    "intro": "Martellidendron kariangense, commonly known as the Kariangense sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in lowland rainforests and moist hill forests. The plant is characterized by its aromatic bark and leaves, which emit a distinctive resinous scent. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the fruit is a capsule that releases winged seeds for wind dispersal. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
