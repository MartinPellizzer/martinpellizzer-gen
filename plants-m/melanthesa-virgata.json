    "intro": "Melanthesa virgata, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Melanthesa virgata is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
