    "intro": "Mimosa binervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Mimosa binervia is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure."
