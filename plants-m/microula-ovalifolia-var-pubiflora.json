    "intro": "Microula ovalifolia var. pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered microula, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. The varietal form 'pubiflora' is distinguished by its hairy inflorescences, which provide some protection against desiccation."
