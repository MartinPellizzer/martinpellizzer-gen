    "intro": "Mimosa vellosiana, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch or light. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
