    "intro": "Mackenziea hirsutissima, commonly known as the Mackenzie's hairy bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
