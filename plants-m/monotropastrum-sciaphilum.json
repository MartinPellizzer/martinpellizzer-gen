    "intro": "Monotropastrum sciaphilum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the stems of other species. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, emitting a faint, sweet scent. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients. Due to its reliance on specific hosts and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
