It is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically clustered in dense, showy inflorescences, often with five petals and stamens. Metastachydium species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia. These plants are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to dry conditions with their succulent leaves and deep root systems."
