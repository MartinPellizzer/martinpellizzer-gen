    "intro": "Megalastrum inaequalifolium var. glabrior, commonly known as the roughleaf megalastrum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrior' variant is notably smoother in texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
