It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and seasonal flowering."
