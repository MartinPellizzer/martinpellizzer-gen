    "intro": "Melica sarmentosa var. monticola, commonly known as mountain basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. This variety is often found in rocky soils and open habitats at high elevations."
