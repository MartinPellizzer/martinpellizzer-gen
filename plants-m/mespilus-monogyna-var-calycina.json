    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. calycina, commonly known as the calycine medlar, is a rare botanical variant of the medlar species. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx that remains attached to the fruit even after maturity. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in woodland or hedgerow environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces a fleshy, edible fruit. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a botanically significant species."
