    "intro": "Melampyrum bihariense f. roemeri, commonly known as the Himalayan touch-me-not, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that resemble those of the genus *Impatiens*, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions of the Himalayas, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, elliptical leaflets, and it produces pods that burst open to disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
