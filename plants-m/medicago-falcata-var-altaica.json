It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sickle-shaped leaflet. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. This variety is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
