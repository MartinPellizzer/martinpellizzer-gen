    "intro": "Malaxis palmicola, commonly known as the palm-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence. Its leaves are long and strap-like, resembling palm fronds, which is reflected in its common name. Due to habitat destruction, Malaxis palmicola is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
