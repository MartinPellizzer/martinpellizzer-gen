    "intro": "Miconia gibba, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of velvety, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia gibba is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some areas."
