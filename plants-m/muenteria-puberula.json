    "intro": "Muenteria puberula, commonly known as the silky muenteria, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces elliptical, glossy green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, attracting various bird species. Muenteria puberula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
