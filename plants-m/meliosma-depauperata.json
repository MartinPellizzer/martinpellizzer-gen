    "intro": "Meliosma depauperata, commonly known as the poorleaf meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
