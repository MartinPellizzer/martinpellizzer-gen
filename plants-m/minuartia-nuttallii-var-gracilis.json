It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, occurring in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or coastal dunes. This plant is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its resilience in harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
