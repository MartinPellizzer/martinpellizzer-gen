    "intro": "Mimosa spectabilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow to pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it both ecologically and aesthetically valuable."
