    "intro": "Matteuccia nodulosa, commonly known as the barren winged fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in small, rounded structures called nodules. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
