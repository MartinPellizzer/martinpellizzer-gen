    "intro": "Maxillaria divaricata, commonly known as the variegated maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, providing a lush backdrop for its vibrant blooms. Maxillaria divaricata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
