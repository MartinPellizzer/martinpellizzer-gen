    "intro": "Micrantheum inversum, commonly known as the inverted micrantheum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its unique floral structure features upward-facing petals that contrast with its downward-facing sepals, creating an unusual visual appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
