    "intro": "Malacoxylum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to several meters. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in racemes. The fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature."
