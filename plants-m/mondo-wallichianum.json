    "intro": "Mondo wallichianum, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features dense clusters of narrow, dark green leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical seed spikes. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ground-covering ability. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for woodland gardens and erosion control."
