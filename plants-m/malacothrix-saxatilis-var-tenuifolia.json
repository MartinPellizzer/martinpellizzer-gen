    "intro": "Malacothrix saxatilis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf rock moss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas."
