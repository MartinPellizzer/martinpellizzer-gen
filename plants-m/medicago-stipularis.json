    "intro": "Medicago stipularis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and pastures. Medicago stipularis is also used as a forage crop and in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
