    "intro": "Mallophora corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. The clustered inflorescence gives the plant its common name, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
