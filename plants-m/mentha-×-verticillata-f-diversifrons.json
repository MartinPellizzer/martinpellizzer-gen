    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. diversifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaf watermint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, broadly oval leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, typical of the mint family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
