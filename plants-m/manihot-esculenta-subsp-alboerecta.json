    "intro": "Manihot esculenta subsp. alboerecta, commonly known as the upright cassava, is a subspecies of the cassava plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, which distinguishes it from other cassava varieties that tend to be more sprawling. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its tuberous roots are the primary economic product, used for food and industrial purposes. This subspecies is valued for its high starch content and adaptability to various soil conditions."
