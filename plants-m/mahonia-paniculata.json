It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
