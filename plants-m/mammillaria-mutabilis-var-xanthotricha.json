    "intro": "Mammillaria mutabilis var. xanthotricha, commonly known as the golden hair mammillaria, is a small, compact cactus native to the deserts of Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with prominent, woolly spines that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically followed by red or orange fruits. Its dense, fuzzy covering helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in arid gardens and as a houseplant."
