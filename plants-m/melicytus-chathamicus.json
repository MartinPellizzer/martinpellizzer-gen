    "intro": "Melicytus chathamicus, commonly known as the Chatham Island melicytus, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
