    "intro": "Micropera sheryliae, commonly known as the Sherylia's micropera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are white with prominent yellow stamens. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Micropera sheryliae is considered a vulnerable species."
