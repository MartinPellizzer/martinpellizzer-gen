    "intro": "Masdevallia ellipes, commonly known as the pink-veined masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light to prevent leaf burn. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
