    "intro": "Maranthes chrysophylla subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved maranthes, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its rough, textured leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
