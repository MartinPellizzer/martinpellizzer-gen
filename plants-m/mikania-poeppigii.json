    "intro": "Mikania poeppigii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
