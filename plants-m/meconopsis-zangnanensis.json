    "intro": "Meconopsis zangnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple petals. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Meconopsis zangnanensis is known for its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
