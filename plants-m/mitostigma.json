    "intro": "Mitostigma, commonly known as the \"spider orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance, with elongated, thread-like petals and sepals that resemble spider legs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Mitostigma species are known for their small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. These plants are prized by horticulturists for their unique beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
