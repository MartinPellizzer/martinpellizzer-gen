    "intro": "Macaranga cassandrae, commonly known as the white-veined macaranga, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges due to its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Macaranga cassandrae is also known for its role in ecological succession and its use in traditional medicine."
