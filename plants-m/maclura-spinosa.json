    "intro": "Maclura spinosa, commonly known as yellow wood or honey locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in racemes, followed by woody, spiny pods that contain flattened seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes adds to its ecological and cultural significance."
