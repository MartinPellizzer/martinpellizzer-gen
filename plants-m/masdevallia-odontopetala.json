It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures with distinctive tooth-like projections on its petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with a fragrant aroma that attracts specific pollinators. The leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette, adapted to store moisture in its native habitat."
