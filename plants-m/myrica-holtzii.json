    "intro": "Myrica holtzii, commonly known as the desert wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, wax-coated leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Myrica holtzii is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
