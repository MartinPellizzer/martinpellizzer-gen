    "intro": "Mediolobivia ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mediolobivia ritteri is considered a conservation concern."
