    "intro": "Mammillaria knippeliana, commonly known as the Knippel's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white spines and a grayish-green body. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and produces yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
