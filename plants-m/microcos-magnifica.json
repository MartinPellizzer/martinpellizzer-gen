    "intro": "Microcos magnifica, commonly known as the grand marvel plant, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of red and orange. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, due to habitat loss, it is now considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
