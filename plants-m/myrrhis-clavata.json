    "intro": "Myrrhis clavata, commonly known as the clustered sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, slender stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and anti-inflammatory properties. Myrrhis clavata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
