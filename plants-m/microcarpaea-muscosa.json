It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Microcarpaea muscosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
