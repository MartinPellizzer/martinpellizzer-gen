    "intro": "Medicago obscura f. muricata, commonly known as the rough medick, is a perennial legume characterized by its hairy, upright stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, hairy pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. This subspecies is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its hairy foliage and stems give it a distinctive appearance, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
