    "intro": "Malaxis minutiflora, commonly known as the minute-flowered malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, greenish-yellow blooms. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
