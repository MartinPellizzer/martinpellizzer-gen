    "intro": "Microseris teakleana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes\u7f42\u7c9f (poppy) and other related species. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Microseris teakleana is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky soils along mountain ranges."
