    "intro": "Microdon cylindricus, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stem and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Microdon cylindricus is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to grow in arid or semi-arid environments. It has smooth, succulent stems that help it retain water in dry conditions."
