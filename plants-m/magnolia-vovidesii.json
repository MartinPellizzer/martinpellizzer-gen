    "intro": "Magnolia vovidesii, commonly known as the Vovides magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
