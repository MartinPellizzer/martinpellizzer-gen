    "intro": "Monarrhenus pinifolius, commonly known as the needle-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are needle-like, reducing water loss through transpiration, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
