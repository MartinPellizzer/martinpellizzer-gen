    "intro": "Mandevilla brachysiphon, commonly known as the narrow-siphon mandevilla, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises, arbors, and as a ground cover in tropical landscapes."
