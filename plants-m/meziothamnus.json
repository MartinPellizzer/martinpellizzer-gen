    "intro": "Meziothamnus, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plants typically grow in grasslands and rocky areas, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Meziothamnus species often have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and may produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. These plants are adapted to arid conditions and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
