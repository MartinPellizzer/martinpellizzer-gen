It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland forests. Melicope suberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some Pacific cultures."
