    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 hemicycla var. maxima, commonly known as the Greater Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Additionally, it is a valuable forage plant for livestock due to its high nutritional content."
