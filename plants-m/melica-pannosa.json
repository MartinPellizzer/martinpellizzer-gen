    "intro": "Melica pannosa, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and meadows, and is often found in temperate climates. Melica pannosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
