    "intro": "Moraea venenata, commonly known as the poison arrow lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-like flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively. Moraea venenata is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
