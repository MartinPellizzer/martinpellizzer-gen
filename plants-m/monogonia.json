    "intro": "Monogonia, commonly known as the \"single horn\" plant, is a rare and unique species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its singular, elongated flower stalk that bears a single umbel of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes that resemble those of other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Monogonia is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
