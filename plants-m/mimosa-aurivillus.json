    "intro": "Mimosa aurivillus, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow flower clusters that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in some regions. The leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait that adds to its unique botanical appeal."
