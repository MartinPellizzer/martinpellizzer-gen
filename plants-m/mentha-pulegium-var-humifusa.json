    "intro": "Mentha pulegium var. humifusa, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a strong, pungent essential oil, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and potential toxicity to livestock."
