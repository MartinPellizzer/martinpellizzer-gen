    "intro": "Molinia caerulea subsp. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish moorland grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and grasslands, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from blue to purple. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
