    "intro": "Mollugo hoffmannseggiana, commonly known as Hoffmann's sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, ribbed stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered near the base of the stems. Its leaves are usually opposite and linear, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Mollugo hoffmannseggiana is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
