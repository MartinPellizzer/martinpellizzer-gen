    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. viscosissima, commonly known as the sticky sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, sickle-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, sunny habitats. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil, and its sticky hairs on the leaves and stems give it its common name. This variety is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
