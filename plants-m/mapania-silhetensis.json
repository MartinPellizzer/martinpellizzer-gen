    "intro": "Mapania silhetensis, commonly known as the Silhet mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Bangladesh. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
