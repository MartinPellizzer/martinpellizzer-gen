    "intro": "Medicago hispida var. polygyra, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained conditions. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its hairy stems and leaves provide habitat for beneficial insects, making it valuable in ecological gardening."
