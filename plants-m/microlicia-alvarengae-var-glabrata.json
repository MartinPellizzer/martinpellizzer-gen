    "intro": "Microlicia alvarengae var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth microlicia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and potentially endangered species."
