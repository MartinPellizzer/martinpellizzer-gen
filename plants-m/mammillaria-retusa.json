It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Mammillaria retusa is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections due to its compact size and unique appearance."
