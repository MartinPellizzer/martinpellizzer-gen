    "intro": "Mirasolia calva, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thin, upright stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Mirasolia calva is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. It plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
