It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes."
