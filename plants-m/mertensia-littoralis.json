    "intro": "Mertensia littoralis, commonly known as coastal bluebells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and tidal zones, showcasing its adaptation to saline and brackish environments. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are typically blue to purple, blooming in early spring. Mertensia littoralis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dune systems and providing nectar for pollinators."
