    "intro": "Mascarenhasia arborescens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Mascarenhasia, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its angular, often branching stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in coastal forests or scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
