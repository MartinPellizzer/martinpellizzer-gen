    "intro": "Manihot dichotoma, commonly known as the arrowleaf milkweed, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, arrow-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its latex is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting certain insect populations."
