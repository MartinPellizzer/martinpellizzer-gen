    "intro": "Microtropis longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited microtropis, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. Microtropis longicarpa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
