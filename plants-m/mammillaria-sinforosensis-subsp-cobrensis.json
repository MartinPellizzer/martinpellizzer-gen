    "intro": "Mammillaria sinforosensis subsp. cobrensis, commonly known as the Cobres Sierra cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 centimeters and has a globular or cylindrical shape. The plant features a dense covering of white or pale pink glochids, which are soft, barbed hairs. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, and its succulent stems store water efficiently. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
