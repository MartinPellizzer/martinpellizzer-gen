    "intro": "Machilus, commonly known as the Chinese laurel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. These evergreen shrubs or small trees are native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. They are characterized by their aromatic leaves, which often have a distinct, spicy scent. The flowers are typically small and clustered, and the fruits are drupes that contain a single seed. Machilus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
