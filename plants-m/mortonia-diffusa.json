    "intro": "Mortonia diffusa, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It features slender, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its reproductive system relies on spore dispersal, typical of ferns, and it plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique botanical species."
