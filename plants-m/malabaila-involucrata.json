    "intro": "Malabaila involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Malabaila involucrata is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
