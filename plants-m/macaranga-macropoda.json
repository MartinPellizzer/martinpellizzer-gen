    "intro": "Macaranga macropoda, commonly known as the broad-leafed macaranga, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges due to its adaptability. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. Macaranga macropoda plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
