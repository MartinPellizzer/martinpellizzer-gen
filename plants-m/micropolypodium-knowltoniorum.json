    "intro": "Micropolypodium knowltoniorum, commonly known as the Knowlton's polypody, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a light green color and a finely textured appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Micropolypodium knowltoniorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
