    "intro": "Medicago lupulina f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth bursch vetch, is a variant of the common vetch. It is a leguminous plant characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by distinctive, three-lobed burs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
