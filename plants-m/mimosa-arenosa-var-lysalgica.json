    "intro": "Mimosa arenosa var. lysalgica, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Mimosa arenosa var. lysalgica is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
