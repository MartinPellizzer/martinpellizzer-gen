    "intro": "Metrosideros speciosa, commonly known as the Tahitian cherry or 'Ahupua'a, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its showy, red or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in coastal and wet forest environments, and its rapid growth makes it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside of Hawaii."
