    "intro": "Mastixia subcaudata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mastixia, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
