    "intro": "Miconia laxa, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often found in humid lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions outside its native range."
