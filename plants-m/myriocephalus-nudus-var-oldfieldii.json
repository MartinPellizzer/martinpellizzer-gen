    "intro": "Myriocephalus nudus var. oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfield's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in soft substrates. Its leaves are often submerged, while some are floating, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
