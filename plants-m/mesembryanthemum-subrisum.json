It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along coastal areas. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
