    "intro": "Morus laevigata, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically white or pale green on the underside. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are edible and have a sweet, juicy flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fruit and as a host plant for silkworms. Morus laevigata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional medicine."
