    "intro": "Morongia horridula, commonly known as the rough morong, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often accompanied by bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Morongia horridula is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
