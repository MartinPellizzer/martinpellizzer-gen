    "intro": "Mandevilla hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mandevilla, is a vigorous evergreen vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, waxy leaves and clusters of trumpet-shaped, fragrant flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value. It produces showy blooms throughout the growing season, typically from spring to fall. Mandevilla hirsuta is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical regions."
