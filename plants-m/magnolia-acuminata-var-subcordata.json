It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are narrow and pointed at the tip. The tree produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a range of soil types."
