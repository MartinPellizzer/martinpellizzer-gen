    "intro": "Miconia lutescens subsp. piurensis, commonly known as the yellow miconia, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
