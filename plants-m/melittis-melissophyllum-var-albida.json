    "intro": "Melittis melissophyllum var. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered honeyplant, is a variant of the honeyplant species native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to their nectar-rich structure. The botanical significance of this variant lies in its unique floral coloration and its role in local ecosystems."
