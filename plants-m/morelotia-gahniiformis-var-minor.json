    "intro": "Morelotia gahniiformis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf creeping marsh fern, is a low-growing fern native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It features slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Morelotia gahniiformis."
