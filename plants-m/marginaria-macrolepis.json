    "intro": "Marginaria macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved marginaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, pubescent hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Marginaria macrolepis is well adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
