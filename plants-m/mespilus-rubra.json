    "intro": "Mespilus rubra, commonly known as the red medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by unique, fleshy fruits that ripen in the autumn. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. The fruit, which is typically harvested when it is partially decayed, has a complex flavor and is used in traditional culinary applications. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture."
