    "intro": "Malus calvilla rubra, commonly known as the red crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, tart apples that are often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. The red crabapple is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
