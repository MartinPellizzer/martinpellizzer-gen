    "intro": "Mimosa asperata var. hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
