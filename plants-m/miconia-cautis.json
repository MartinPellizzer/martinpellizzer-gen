    "intro": "Miconia cautis, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Miconia cautis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its introduction in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
