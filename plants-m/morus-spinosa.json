    "intro": "Morus spinosa, commonly known as the spiny mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rough, often thorny branches and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are typically green when immature and turn dark purple or black when ripe. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Morus spinosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance."
