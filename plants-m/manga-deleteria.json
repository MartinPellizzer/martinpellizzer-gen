    "intro": "Manga deleteria, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a rough texture. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts certain pollinators. Despite its name, it is not harmful to humans and is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal."
