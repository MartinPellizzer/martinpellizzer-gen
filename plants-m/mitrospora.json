    "intro": "Mitrospora, commonly known as the \"spore-bearing fungus,\" is a genus of fungi that belongs to the order Sordariales. These fungi are primarily characterized by their production of thick-walled, multilocular spores, which are often found in soil and decaying organic matter. Mitrospora species are saprophytic, meaning they decompose dead plant material, playing a role in nutrient cycling in ecosystems. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where high humidity supports their growth. Due to their spore structure, they are often used in taxonomic studies to classify other fungi within the same order."
