    "intro": "Micromyrtus vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy tea-tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
