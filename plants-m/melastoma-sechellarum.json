    "intro": "Melastoma sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles melastoma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Seychelles Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom from September to December. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Melastoma sechellarum is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in forest understories."
