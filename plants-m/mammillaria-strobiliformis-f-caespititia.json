Its stems are typically covered in white to pale yellow spines and have a rounded, almost globular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are often borne on short pedicels. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This cultivar is prized for its compact form and ornamental appearance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
