It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in loose clusters. The plant has smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
