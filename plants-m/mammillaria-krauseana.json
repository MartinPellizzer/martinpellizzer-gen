    "intro": "Mammillaria krauseana, commonly known as the Krause's bunny ear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring short, white spines and a smooth, pale green body. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5-10 centimeters and has a unique, almost spherical shape. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are relatively short-lived but add to its ornamental value. This species is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-drained soil and requires minimal water to thrive."
