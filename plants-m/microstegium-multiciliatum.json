    "intro": "Microstegium multiciliatum, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with smooth, waxy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Microstegium multiciliatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a valuable ground cover and an invasive species in some regions."
