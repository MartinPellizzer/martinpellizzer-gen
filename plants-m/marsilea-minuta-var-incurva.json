    "intro": "Marsilea minuta var. incurva, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, still waters. It has small, heart-shaped leaves that often float on the water surface or lie submerged. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by dark brown, floating seeds. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
