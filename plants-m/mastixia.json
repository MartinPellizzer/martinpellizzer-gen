    "intro": "Mastixia, commonly known as the gum tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their distinctive, often flaky bark and aromatic resin. The genus includes several species, such as Mastixia sylvatica, which is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Mastixia trees can grow to significant heights and are often found in woodland and scrub habitats. Their botanical features make them important components of native Australian ecosystems."
