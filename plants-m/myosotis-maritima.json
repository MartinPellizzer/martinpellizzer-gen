    "intro": "Myosotis maritima, commonly known as sea forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate blue or violet flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and cliffs near the shore. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Myosotis maritima is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime environments."
