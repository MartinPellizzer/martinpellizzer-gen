    "intro": "Miconia subulipetala, commonly known as the needle-leaved miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces large, showy bracts that can resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Miconia subulipetala is known for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other tropical regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
