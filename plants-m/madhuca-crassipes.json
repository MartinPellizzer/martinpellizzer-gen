    "intro": "Madhuca crassipes, commonly known as the thick-leaved tallow tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are thick and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by the development of woody, spherical fruits. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber due to its durable wood."
