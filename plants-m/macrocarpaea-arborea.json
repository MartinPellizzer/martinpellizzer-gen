    "intro": "Macrocarpaea arborea, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
