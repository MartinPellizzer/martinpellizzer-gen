    "intro": "Maxillaria subulifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaf maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
