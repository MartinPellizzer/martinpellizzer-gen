It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy conditions. Microlaena micranthera plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
