    "intro": "Muhlenbergia madrensis, commonly known as the Madre de Cielo grass, is a native grass species found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces delicate, feathery plumes during the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes. Its fine texture and light green foliage add ornamental value to gardens and natural areas. Muhlenbergia madrensis is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
