    "intro": "Metrosideros petiolata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows along coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. The species is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds, making it well adapted to its maritime environment."
