    "intro": "Melocactus amstutziae, commonly known as the Amstutz's melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Melocactus amstutziae is well-suited for cultivation in xerophytic gardens due to its low water requirements and striking appearance."
