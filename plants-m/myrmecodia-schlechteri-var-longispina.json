    "intro": "Myrmecodia schlechteri var. longispina, commonly known as the horned antplant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like caudex and specialized structures called \"pseudopods\" that house colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food. Its leaves are small, thick, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals."
