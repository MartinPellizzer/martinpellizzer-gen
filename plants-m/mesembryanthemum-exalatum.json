    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum exalatum, commonly known as the starry ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
