    "intro": "Micromeria peltieri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Micromeria peltieri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
