    "intro": "Millettia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy millettia, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Millettia hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
