    "intro": "Mimosa acerba var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Due to its sensitive nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated for its unique foliage and ease of care."
