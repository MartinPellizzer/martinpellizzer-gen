    "intro": "Mastigloscleria, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine, venomous hairs that cause an irritating rash upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Mastigloscleria species are known for their ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually, contributing to their widespread distribution."
