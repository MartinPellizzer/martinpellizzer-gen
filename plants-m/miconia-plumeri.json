    "intro": "Miconia plumeri, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia plumeri is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and ability to outcompete native plants."
