    "intro": "Manihot xavantinensis, commonly known as the Xavantini manioc, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a starchy root tuber that is similar to cassava but has a higher moisture content. It is often cultivated for its edible roots, which are used in various traditional dishes. However, it is less commonly grown commercially compared to other manioc species due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements."
