    "intro": "Miconia cerasiflora, commonly known as the cherry-fruit miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions."
