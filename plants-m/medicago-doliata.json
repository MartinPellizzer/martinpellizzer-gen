It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and elongated, hairy pods that contain small, round seeds. This plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a cover crop or forage. Medicago doliata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
