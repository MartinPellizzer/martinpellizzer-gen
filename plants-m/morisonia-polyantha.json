It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, bright red or orange flowers that resemble coral. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with compound leaves and pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Morisonia polyantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
