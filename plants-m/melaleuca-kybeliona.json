It is native to the coastal regions of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid climates. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native animals. Due to its hardy nature, it is also sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
