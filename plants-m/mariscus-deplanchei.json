    "intro": "Mariscus deplanchei, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Mariscus deplanchei is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
