    "intro": "Myristica sulcata, commonly known as the narrow-ridged nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruit that contains both nutmeg and mace. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has dark green, leathery leaves. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous aril, which is used to produce the spice mace. Myristica sulcata is valued not only for its economic importance as a spice crop but also for its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
