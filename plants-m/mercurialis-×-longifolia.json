It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
