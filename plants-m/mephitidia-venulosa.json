    "intro": "Mephitidia venulosa, commonly known as the fragrant mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the temperate woodlands of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring, producing small, fragrant white flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in shaded areas under the canopy of deciduous forests. Mephitidia venulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
