    "intro": "Molinia depauperata, commonly known as the poor grass or lesser moorgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to Eurasia. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs, heaths, and other wetland environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Molinia depauperata is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
