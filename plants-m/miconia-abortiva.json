    "intro": "Miconia abortiva, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and showy, red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Miconia abortiva is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
