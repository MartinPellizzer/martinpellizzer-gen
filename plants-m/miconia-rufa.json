    "intro": "Miconia rufa, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by distinctive, velvety red fruits. Miconia rufa is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
