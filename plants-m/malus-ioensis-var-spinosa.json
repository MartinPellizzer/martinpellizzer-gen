It is characterized by its distinctive thorn-like buds and small, fragrant white flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are oval-shaped with a rough texture and turn yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, red or yellow apple-like berry that ripens in late summer. This plant is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
