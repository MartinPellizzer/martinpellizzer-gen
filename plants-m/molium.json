It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Molium has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
