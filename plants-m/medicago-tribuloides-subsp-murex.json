    "intro": "Medicago tribuloides subsp. murex, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, spiny pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
