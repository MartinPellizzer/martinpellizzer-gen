    "intro": "Magnolia mutabilis, commonly known as the everblooming magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that appear in late winter or early spring before the leaves emerge. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and remain open for several weeks, gradually changing color as they age. The tree has smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
