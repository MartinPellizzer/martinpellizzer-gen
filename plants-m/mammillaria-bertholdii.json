    "intro": "Mammillaria bertholdii, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
