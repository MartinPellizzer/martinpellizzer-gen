    "intro": "Miconia friedrichlehmanni, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, making it one of the largest leaf plants in the world. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in non-native regions."
