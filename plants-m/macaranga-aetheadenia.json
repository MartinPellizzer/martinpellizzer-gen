    "intro": "Macaranga aetheadenia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian rubber plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
