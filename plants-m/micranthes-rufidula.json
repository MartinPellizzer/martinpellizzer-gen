It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and the flowers are pale green to white in color. Micranthes rufidula is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
