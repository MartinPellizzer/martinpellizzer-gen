    "intro": "Mitragyna, commonly known as kratom, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which also includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and small white flowers that bloom in clusters. Mitragyna species, such as Mitragyna speciosa, contain psychoactive alkaloids like mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. These compounds are primarily found in the leaves and are responsible for the plant's medicinal and stimulant properties."
