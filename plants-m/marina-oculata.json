    "intro": "Marina oculata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silvery, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates where it is exposed to sea spray. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Marina oculata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
