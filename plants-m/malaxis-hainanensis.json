    "intro": "Malaxis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan malaxis, is a rare orchid species endemic to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
