    "intro": "Machairophyllum brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved arrowleaf, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its narrow, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Machairophyllum brevifolium is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
