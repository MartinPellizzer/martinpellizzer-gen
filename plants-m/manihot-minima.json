    "intro": "Manihot minima, commonly known as the dwarf arrowleaf manioc, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the spurge family. Its latex, like that of other manioc species, contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing before consumption. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
