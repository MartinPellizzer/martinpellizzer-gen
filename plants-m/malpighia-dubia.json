    "intro": "Malpighia dubia, commonly known as the yellow mallow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malpighiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are edible and often consumed by birds and mammals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a shallow root system that helps it anchor in moist soils. Malpighia dubia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
