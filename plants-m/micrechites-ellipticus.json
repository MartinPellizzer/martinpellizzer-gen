    "intro": "Micrechites ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid environments."
