    "intro": "Manihot montana, commonly known as the mountain cassava, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are used for their starchy properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and clearings. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible root and ornamental value."
