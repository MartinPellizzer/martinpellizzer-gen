    "intro": "Myrmecostylum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique adaptations that facilitate a symbiotic relationship with ants. The plant produces nectar-secreting structures called extrafloral nectaries, which attract and nourish ants. These ants, in turn, provide protection against herbivores and competing plants. Myrmecostylum species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia."
