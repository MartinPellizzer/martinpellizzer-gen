    "intro": "Minuartia sedoides, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler regions."
