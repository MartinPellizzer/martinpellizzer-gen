    "intro": "Malaxis alvaroi, commonly known as the Alvaro's lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose, curved cluster. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open, sunny habitats. It is a terrestrial orchid that produces a single, narrow, leafless stem bearing the flowering spike. Malaxis alvaroi is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
