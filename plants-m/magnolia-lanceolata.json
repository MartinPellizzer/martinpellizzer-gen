    "intro": "Magnolia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The flowers are followed by dark purple, egg-shaped fruits that contain winged seeds."
