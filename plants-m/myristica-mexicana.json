    "intro": "Myristica mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. The seeds, known as nuts, are used in traditional medicine and have a distinct, spicy aroma similar to nutmeg. Myristica mexicana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
