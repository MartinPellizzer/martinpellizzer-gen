    "intro": "Modesta insignis, commonly known as the slender rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in crevices. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
