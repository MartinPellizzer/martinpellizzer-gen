It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures. Its small, delicate flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, rounded fruits known as cypsela. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microchirita marcanii is considered a species of conservation concern."
