    "intro": "Marila macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its rhizomes grow beneath the water, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the substrate. Marila macrophylla plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
