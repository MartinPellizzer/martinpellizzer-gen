    "intro": "Miconia adamantinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or golden star, is a tropical shrub native to Brazil. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the stems are woody and often branched. Miconia adamantinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
