    "intro": "Myriophyllum pinnatum, commonly known as watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Myriophyllum pinnatum has small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, and it is often found floating at the water's surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates."
