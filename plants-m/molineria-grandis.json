    "intro": "Molineria grandis, commonly known as the giant tussock grass, is a tall perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and coastal areas. Molineria grandis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
