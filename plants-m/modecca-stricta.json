It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
