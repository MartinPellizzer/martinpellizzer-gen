    "intro": "Microtea glochidiata, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in the spring. Its pads, or cladodes, are covered in small, sharp spines called glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism. The fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has been used for food and traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
