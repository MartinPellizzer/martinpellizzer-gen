    "intro": "Miconia rufistellata, commonly known as the red-stemmed miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
