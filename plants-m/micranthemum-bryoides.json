    "intro": "Micranthemum bryoides, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Micranthemum bryoides is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
