    "intro": "Myrmecodia horrida, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It forms a specialized structure called a \"koomkong,\" which provides shelter for colonies of ants. The plant's thorn-like structures help protect it from herbivores and also serve as a means of anchoring itself to host trees. Myrmecodia horrida has a complex relationship with its ant inhabitants, where the ants defend the plant from predators in exchange for shelter and food. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying mutualistic relationships in tropical ecosystems."
