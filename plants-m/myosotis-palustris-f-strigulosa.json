    "intro": "Myosotis palustris f. strigulosa, commonly known as the hairy water forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe. It features small, delicate blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other varieties of Myosotis. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
