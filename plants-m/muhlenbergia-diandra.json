    "intro": "Muhlenbergia diandra, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes in the summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps. Muhlenbergia diandra is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
