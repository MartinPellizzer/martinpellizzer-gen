    "intro": "Martiodendron elatum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western flax or desert flax, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems covered in soft, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating to further conserve moisture. This species is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
