    "intro": "Macrozamia fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Australia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a subtropical to tropical climate. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
