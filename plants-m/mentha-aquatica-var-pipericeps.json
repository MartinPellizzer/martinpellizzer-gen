    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. pipericeps, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and serrated leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. This plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its square stems and opposite leaves are typical of the mint family, Lamiaceae. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
