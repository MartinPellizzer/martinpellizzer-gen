    "intro": "Mascagnia sepium var. typica, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible but contains toxic compounds. Due to its drought tolerance and unique ecological role, it is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh desert environments."
