    "intro": "Marattia costulisora, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and serrated leaf margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests near water bodies. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology. Due to habitat destruction, Marattia costulisora is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
