It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, yellow-orange fruits that resemble small horns. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat offensive odor. Its flowers are yellow with five petals and are followed by the unique, spiky fruits. The fruit contains a sweet, edible pulp surrounding large, inedible seeds."
