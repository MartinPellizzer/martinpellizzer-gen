    "intro": "Malaxis ramosii, commonly known as the ramose malaxis, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal coating, which aids in nutrient absorption. Malaxis ramosii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
