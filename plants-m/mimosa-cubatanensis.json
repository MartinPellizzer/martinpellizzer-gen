    "intro": "Mimosa cubatanensis, commonly known as the Cuban mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with slender branches and a tendency to droop when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
