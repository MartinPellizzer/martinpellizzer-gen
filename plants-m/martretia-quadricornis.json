    "intro": "Martretia quadricornis, commonly known as the four-horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive four horn-like structures on its seed pods. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Martretia quadricornis thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils."
