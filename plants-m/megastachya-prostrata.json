It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Megastachya prostrata is adapted to wet, boggy environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
