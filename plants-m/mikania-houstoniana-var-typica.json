    "intro": "Mikania houstoniana var. typica, commonly known as Houstonian spider vine, is a fast-growing, twining vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically light to dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by silky, white to pale yellow seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in disturbed areas, along stream banks, and in shaded woodlands. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
