    "intro": "Merremia gangetica, commonly known as Indian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
