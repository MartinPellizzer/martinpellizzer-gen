    "intro": "Moehringia malyi, commonly known as Maly's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal and rosette-forming, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The small white or pale yellow flowers appear in early summer and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
