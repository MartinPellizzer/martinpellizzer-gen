    "intro": "Mediolobivia turbiniformis, commonly known as the spiral-shaped orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which is an adaptation to maximize sunlight absorption in its mountainous habitat. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and specialized for nutrient absorption from thin, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mediolobivia turbiniformis is considered a vulnerable species."
