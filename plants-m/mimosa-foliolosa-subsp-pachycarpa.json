    "intro": "Mimosa foliolosa subsp. pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited mimosoid, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, followed by hairy, inflated pods that contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
