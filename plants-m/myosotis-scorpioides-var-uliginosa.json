The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
