    "intro": "Mimosa sabulicola, commonly known as the sand mimosa, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous tiny leaflets that fold together when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Mimosa sabulicola plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
