    "intro": "Millingtonia nitida, commonly known as the silky oak or white silky tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine areas. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
