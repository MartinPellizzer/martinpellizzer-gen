    "intro": "Melochia parvifolia f. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy melochia, is a shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features small, pale green leaves that are densely covered in fine, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Its hairy foliage and compact growth make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ornamental gardening."
