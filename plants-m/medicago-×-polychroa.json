    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 polychroa, commonly known as the yellow sweet clover, is a hybrid perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and soil stabilization. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
