    "intro": "Marica paludosa, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of basal, spiny, and hairy leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a head surrounded by bracts. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in marsh environments. Marica paludosa is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
