    "intro": "Microlobius mimosoides, commonly known as the mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Microlobius mimosoides thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun."
