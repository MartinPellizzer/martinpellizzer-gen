    "intro": "Masdevallia bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 masdevallia, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures and compact growth habit. The plant typically produces delicate, pendulous flowers with a wide range of hues, including red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure, often growing on tree branches or rocky surfaces. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
