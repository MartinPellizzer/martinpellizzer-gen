    "intro": "Mikania multinervia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail along surfaces. Its fibrous roots and stems allow it to spread quickly, often forming dense mats. Mikania multinervia is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
