    "intro": "Mammillaria obvallata, commonly known as the pebble cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact stem covered in white, woolly spines and has a distinctive crown of small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
