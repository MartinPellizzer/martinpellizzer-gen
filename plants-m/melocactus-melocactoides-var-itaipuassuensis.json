    "intro": "Melocactus melocactoides var. itaipuassuensis, commonly known as the Itaipuassuensis melocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that often develops a swollen base, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the rainy season. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in areas with partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
