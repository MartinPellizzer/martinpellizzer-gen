    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha var. major, commonly known as the red-tipped mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with prominent radial spines that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
