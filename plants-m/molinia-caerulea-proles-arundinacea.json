    "intro": "Molinia caerulea proles arundinacea, commonly known as purple moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive blue-green foliage that turns coppery in autumn. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs, heaths, and damp meadows. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
