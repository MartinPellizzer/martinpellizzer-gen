    "intro": "Marsea chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean marsea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in saline and coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Marsea chilensis produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
