    "intro": "Miconia punctibullata, commonly known as the spotted miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive spots or streaks. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
