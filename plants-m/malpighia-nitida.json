It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that give way to edible, red berries resembling cherries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and as a hedge."
