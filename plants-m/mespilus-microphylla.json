    "intro": "Mespilus microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit, which resembles a small apple, is typically harvested in the fall and is known for its unique, somewhat tart flavor. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
