The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are often borne in clusters, with showy petals and intricate sepals that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists worldwide."
