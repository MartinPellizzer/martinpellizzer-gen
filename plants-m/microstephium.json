    "intro": "Microstephium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, pale blue or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is known for its unique morphology, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit. Microstephium thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
