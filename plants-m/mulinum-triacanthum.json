    "intro": "Mulinum triacanthum, commonly known as the three-spined mullein, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, gray-green leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Mulinum triacanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
