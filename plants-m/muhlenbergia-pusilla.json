    "intro": "Muhlenbergia pusilla, commonly known as the little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery red in the fall. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands. Muhlenbergia pusilla is a valuable component of native plant communities due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil. Its small, fluffy seed heads add ornamental value and support local wildlife."
