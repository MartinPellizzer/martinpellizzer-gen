    "intro": "Mollugo, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Molluginaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, succulent leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Mollugo thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a weed and a hardy ornamental plant."
