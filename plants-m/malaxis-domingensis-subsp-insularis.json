    "intro": "Malaxis domingensis subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Insular Malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to specific islands in the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
