    "intro": "Moraea tristis, commonly known as the melancholy lily, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of flowers that are both ornamental and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Moraea tristis prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that add a delicate texture to its overall appearance."
