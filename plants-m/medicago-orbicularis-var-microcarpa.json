    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its orbicular, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a forage plant for livestock."
