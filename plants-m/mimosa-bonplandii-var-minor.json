    "intro": "Mimosa bonplandii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It features small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its unique morphology and adaptive traits make it a notable species in xerophytic ecosystems."
