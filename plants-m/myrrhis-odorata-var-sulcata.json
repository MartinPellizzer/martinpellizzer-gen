    "intro": "Myrrhis odorata var. sulcata, commonly known as the wrinkled sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed or wrinkled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist environments. The plant is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
