    "intro": "Morus nigra var. scabra, commonly known as the European mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems, which gives it the species name \"scabra.\" The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin and can vary in size. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are dark purple when mature, containing a sweet, edible pulp. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in silk production."
