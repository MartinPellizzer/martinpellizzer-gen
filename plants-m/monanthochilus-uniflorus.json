    "intro": "Monanthochilus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its solitary, showy flower that typically blooms in a striking shade of yellow or orange. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, stocky stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a prized species among orchid enthusiasts."
