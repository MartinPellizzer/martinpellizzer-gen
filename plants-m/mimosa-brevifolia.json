    "intro": "Mimosa brevifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod that splits open when mature. Mimosa brevifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
