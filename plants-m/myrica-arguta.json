It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Myrica arguta is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Its aromatic foliage and adaptability make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
