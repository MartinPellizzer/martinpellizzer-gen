    "intro": "Mammillaria goodrichii, commonly known as the Goodrich's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Mammillaria goodrichii is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
