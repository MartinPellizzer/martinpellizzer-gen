    "intro": "Myrosma nana, commonly known as the dwarf myrosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, featuring compact, dense foliage with leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Myrosma nana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal contribute to its value in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
