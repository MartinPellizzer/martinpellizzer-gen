    "intro": "Muraltia serpyllifolia, commonly known as creeping muraltia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in coastal or rocky garden settings. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover plant."
