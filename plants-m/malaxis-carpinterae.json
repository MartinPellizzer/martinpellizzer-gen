    "intro": "Malaxis carpinterae, commonly known as the Carpinter's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves and delicate inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown patterns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
