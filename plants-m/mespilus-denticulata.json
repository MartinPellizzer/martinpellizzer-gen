    "intro": "Mespilus denticulata, commonly known as the spiny medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, spiny bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits that ripen in autumn. The fruit has a distinct aroma and is often used in culinary applications, though it can be somewhat tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows."
