    "intro": "Melasma spathaceum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its scientific name reflects its melasma, or mucus-like, appearance, and its spathaceum refers to the spathe, a leaf-like structure that encloses the flower. Melasma spathaceum plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
