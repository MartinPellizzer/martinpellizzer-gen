It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
