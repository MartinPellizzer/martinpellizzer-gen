    "intro": "Macaranga gummiflua, commonly known as the sticky leaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that exude a sticky, milky sap when damaged. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces capsules containing numerous seeds. The sap of Macaranga gummiflua has been used in traditional medicine and for adhesive purposes due to its viscoelastic properties."
