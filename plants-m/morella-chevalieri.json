    "intro": "Morella chevalieri, commonly known as the New Zealand candlewood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its ability to thrive in coastal and inland forest environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by wind, followed by the development of woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Morella chevalieri is also valued for its historical use by M\u0101ori for various purposes, including the production of a type of lamp oil."
