    "intro": "Melicytus umbellatus, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant forms dense, bushy growths and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its berries are bright red and are an important food source for native birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth of its host plants."
