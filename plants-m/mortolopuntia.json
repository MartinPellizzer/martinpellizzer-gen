    "intro": "Mortolopuntia, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators like moths. They have a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture quickly after rare rains. Mortolopuntia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits."
