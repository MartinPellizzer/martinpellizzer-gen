    "intro": "Miconia ciliata var. plurilocularis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a distinctive, showy inflorescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, star-shaped fruits resembling a starfruit. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense canopies make it an important species in tropical ecosystems. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature."
