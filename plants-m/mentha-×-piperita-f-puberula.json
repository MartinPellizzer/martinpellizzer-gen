    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 piperita f. puberula, commonly known as peppermint with pubescent leaves, is a cultivated variant of peppermint characterized by its densely hairy foliage. This feature distinguishes it from the typical peppermint, which has smoother leaves. The plant is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha piperita and Mentha \u00d7 gracilis. It possesses the characteristic square, hollow stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves typical of the Mentha genus. Its botanical traits make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal uses."
