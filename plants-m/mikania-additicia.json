    "intro": "Mikania additicia, commonly known as Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
