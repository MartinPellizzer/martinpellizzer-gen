    "intro": "Micranthes nelsoniana var. insularis, commonly known as the island micranthes, is a flowering plant native to specific island habitats in the western Pacific. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in coastal or sandy environments. It is often found in low-lying areas with well-drained soil, where it forms dense mats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
