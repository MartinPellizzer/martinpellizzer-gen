    "intro": "Mimosa tricephala var. lignosa, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a woody stem structure, which distinguishes it from the more herbaceous forms of Mimosa tricephala. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval leaflets. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
