    "intro": "Monorchis ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's mouth, is a rare fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its unique, often primitive floral structures. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with a single, dimorphic sporophyll that bears both sterile and fertile leaves. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive, upward-curving tip. The species is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors."
