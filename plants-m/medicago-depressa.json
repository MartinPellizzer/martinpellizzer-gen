    "intro": "Medicago depressa, commonly known as the prostrate medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is adapted to dry environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Medicago depressa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
