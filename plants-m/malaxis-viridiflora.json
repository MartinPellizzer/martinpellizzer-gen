    "intro": "Malaxis viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered malaxis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are arranged in a loose inflorescence, which is a unique characteristic among orchids. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately preserved species in its natural range."
