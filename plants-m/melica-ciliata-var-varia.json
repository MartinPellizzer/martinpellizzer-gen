    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. varia, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine cilia, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
