    "intro": "Metrosideros lutea, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on a host tree for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract insect pollinators. It produces small, red berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
