It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
