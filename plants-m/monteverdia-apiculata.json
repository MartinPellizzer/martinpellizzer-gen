It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant is a climbing vine with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth, glossy surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.
