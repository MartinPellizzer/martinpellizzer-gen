    "intro": "Mirabilis bigelovii var. aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of tubular, four-petaled flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers, which close at night, a trait typical of the four o'clock genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for arid environments. The plant's unique flowering behavior and distinctive foliage make it an interesting subject for botanical study and garden cultivation."
