    "intro": "Mammillaria micans, commonly known as the winking hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are ribbed and covered in prominent tubercles, which are characteristic of the Mammillaria genus. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
