    "intro": "Miconia onychocalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
