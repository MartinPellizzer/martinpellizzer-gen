It features striking, spiky, tubular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
