The plant is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and is often seen in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. It has a low-growing habit and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves are a distinguishing feature of this variety."
