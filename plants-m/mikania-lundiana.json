    "intro": "Mikania lundiana, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. Its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, and the flowers emit a mild fragrance. Mikania lundiana is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun."
