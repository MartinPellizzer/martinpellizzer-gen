    "intro": "Microchilus pachysepalus, commonly known as the thick-sepaled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the wet tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy rhizomes and erect, leafy stems that bear clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. The flowers typically have three prominent sepals and petals, with a lip that is often brightly colored and highly modified. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
