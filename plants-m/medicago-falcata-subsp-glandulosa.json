    "intro": "Medicago falcata subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular goatweed, is a perennial forage plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in its adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It is well-suited for pasture and erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils. The subspecies is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
