    "intro": "Muhlenbergia macrotis, commonly known as the large-panicled muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicles of soft, fluffy seeds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is often bluish-green, and it produces showy, silver-gray seed heads in late summer. Muhlenbergia macrotis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
