    "intro": "Meconopsis cambrica, commonly known as the Welsh poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
