    "intro": "Mimosa hadrocarpa, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous tiny leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical or cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
