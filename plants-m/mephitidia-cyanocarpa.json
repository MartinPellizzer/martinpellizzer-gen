    "intro": "Mephitidia cyanocarpa, commonly known as the blue-fruited mistplant, is a rare species native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue berries, which are encased in a waxy, translucent skin. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender, woody stem. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves."
