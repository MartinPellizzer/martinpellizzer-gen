It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in forage and soil stabilization efforts."
