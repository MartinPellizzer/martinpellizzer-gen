    "intro": "Microchilus venezuelanus, commonly known as the Venezuelan microchilus, is a small flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
