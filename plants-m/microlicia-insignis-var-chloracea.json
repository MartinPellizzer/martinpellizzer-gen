    "intro": "Microlicia insignis var. chloracea, commonly known as the green-flowered microlicia, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in shaded, moist environments with rich soil. Its leaves are ovate and have a smooth texture, while the stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a less commonly cultivated species in horticulture."
