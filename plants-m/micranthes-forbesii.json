    "intro": "Micranthes forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly called the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Forbes' wintergreen typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
