It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is found in mountainous regions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of M. dalmatica."
