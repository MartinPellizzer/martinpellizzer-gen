    "intro": "Mammillaria cowperae, commonly known as the Cowper's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in small, white spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in collections of succulents."
