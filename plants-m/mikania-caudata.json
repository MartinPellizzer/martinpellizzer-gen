    "intro": "Mikania caudata, commonly known as horsehead vine, is a climbing plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
