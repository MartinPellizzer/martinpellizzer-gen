    "intro": "Miquelina kurzii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Miquelina kurzii is well adapted to harsh desert environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
