    "intro": "Melampyrum sylvaticum f. csatoi, commonly known as the red bartsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. This subspecies is noted for its distinctive coloration and ecological role in its native habitats."
