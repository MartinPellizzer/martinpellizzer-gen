    "intro": "Melampyrum barbatum subsp. barbatum, commonly known as goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. The subspecies barbatum is notable for its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other related species."
