    "intro": "Marila pluricostata, commonly known as the many-costed marila, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with multiple lobes and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
