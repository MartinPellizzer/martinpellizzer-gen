    "intro": "Maxillaria cristata, commonly known as the crested orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often arranged in a raceme, with each bloom featuring a spurred lip that aids in pollination. Maxillaria cristata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
