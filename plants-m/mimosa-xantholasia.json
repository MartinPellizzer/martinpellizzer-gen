    "intro": "Mimosa xantholasia, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environments. Its flowers typically bloom in spring and are followed by small, pod-like fruits. The plant is also notable for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
