    "intro": "Mazus gracilis, commonly known as slender mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mazus gracilis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its delicate appearance and ability to spread via stolons make it a suitable ground cover in shaded gardens."
