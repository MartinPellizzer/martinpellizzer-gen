It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three distinct leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
