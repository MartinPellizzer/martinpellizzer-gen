    "intro": "Microtatorchis bracteata, commonly known as the bracted microtatorchis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its bracts, which are modified leaves, are prominent and often brightly colored, serving to attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
