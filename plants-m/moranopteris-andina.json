    "intro": "Moranopteris andina, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its habitat. Moranopteris andina plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native ecosystem."
