    "intro": "Miconia multiplinervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Miconia multiplinervia is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in ecological and horticultural contexts."
