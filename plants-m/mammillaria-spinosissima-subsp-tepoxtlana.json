    "intro": "Mammillaria spinosissima subsp. tepoxtlana, commonly known as the Tepozotlan mammillaria, is a small cactus native to central Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with dense, radial spines that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are usually present in the juvenile stage but are reduced to spines in maturity. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
