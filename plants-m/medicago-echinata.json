    "intro": "Medicago echinata, commonly known as thorned vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green and heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. Medicago echinata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
