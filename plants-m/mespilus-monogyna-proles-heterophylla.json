    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna proles heterophylla, commonly known as the European whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape, a feature reflected in its scientific name. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, yellow berries known as whitebeams. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found in woodland areas or on rocky soils. The plant is relatively slow-growing and can live for several decades, making it a valuable component of temperate forest ecosystems."
