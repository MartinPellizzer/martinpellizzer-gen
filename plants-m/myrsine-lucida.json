    "intro": "Myrsine lucida, commonly known as the shining myrsine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Myrsine lucida is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
