    "intro": "Marsdenia warmingii, commonly known as the Guangxi Marsdenia, is a climbing vine native to southern China. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicle fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
