    "intro": "Maytenus haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian mayten, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Celtidaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
