    "intro": "Machaerium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy machaerium, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its feathery, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Machaerium hirtum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
