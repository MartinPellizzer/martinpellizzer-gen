    "intro": "Melastoma paucifolium, commonly known as the few-leaved melastoma, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often with five petals, during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Melastoma paucifolium is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
