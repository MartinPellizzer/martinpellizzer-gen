    "intro": "Muellera chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan muellera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
