    "intro": "Mammillaria arietina, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its distinctive, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features prominent tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps that give it a textured appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. Mammillaria arietina is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or containers, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure."
