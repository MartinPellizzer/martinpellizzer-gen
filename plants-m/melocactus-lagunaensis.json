It is characterized by its distinctive, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
