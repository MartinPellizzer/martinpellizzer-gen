    "intro": "Medeola verticillifolia, commonly known as the bluebead lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense cluster at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a loose cluster at the end of each leaf stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form clumps over time. Medeola verticillifolia is known for its striking blue berries that appear in late summer, adding ornamental value to woodland gardens."
