    "intro": "Malaxis weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's lady's-tresses, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant, and often white or pale pink floral spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Malaxis weddellii is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them."
