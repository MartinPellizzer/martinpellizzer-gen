    "intro": "Mammillaria kleiniorum, commonly known as the Klein's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a distinctive crown of white to pale pink flowers. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
