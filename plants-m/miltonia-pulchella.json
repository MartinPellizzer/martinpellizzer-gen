    "intro": "Miltonia pulchella, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Miltonia pulchella thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
