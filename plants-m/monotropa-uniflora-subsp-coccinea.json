    "intro": "Monotropa uniflora subsp. coccinea, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host trees for nutrients. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in shaded, forested environments. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its flowers are white and clustered, often appearing in late summer. The species is notable for its unique ecological role and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with specific tree hosts."
