    "intro": "Melaleuca ericifolia var. erubescens, commonly known as the Scarlet Melaleuca, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant is highly aromatic, with a strong, resinous scent, and is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
