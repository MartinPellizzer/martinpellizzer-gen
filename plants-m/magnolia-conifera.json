    "intro": "Magnolia conifera, commonly known as the cone magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
