    "intro": "Micrachne fulva, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
