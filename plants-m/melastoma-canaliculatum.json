    "intro": "Melastoma canaliculatum, commonly known as the red-flowered melastoma, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a distinctive tubular throat. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds. Melastoma canaliculatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
