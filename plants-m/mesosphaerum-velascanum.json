It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Mesosphaerum velascanum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks."
