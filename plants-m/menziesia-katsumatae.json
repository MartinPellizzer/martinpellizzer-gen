It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in late summer. Menziesia katsumatae prefers acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
