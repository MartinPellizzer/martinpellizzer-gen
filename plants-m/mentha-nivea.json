    "intro": "Mentha nivea, commonly known as white mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves that are usually pale green to white in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Mentha nivea is characterized by its aromatic, cool scent, similar to other mints, and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
