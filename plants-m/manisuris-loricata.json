It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant's leaves are covered in small, scale-like structures that provide protection against herbivores and environmental stress. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Manisuris loricata is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky crevices."
