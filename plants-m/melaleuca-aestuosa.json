    "intro": "Melaleuca aestuosa, commonly known as the coastal melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous small, brown seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Melaleuca aestuosa is adapted to salt-laden winds and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
