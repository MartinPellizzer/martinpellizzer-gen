    "intro": "Magnolia llanganatensis, commonly known as the Llanganates magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in the spring, displaying a range of white to pale pink hues. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
