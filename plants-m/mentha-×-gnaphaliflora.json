    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 gnaphaliflora, commonly known as Australian peppermint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha piperita (peppermint) and Mentha viridiflora. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like scent. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in whorls, producing a distinctive peppermint fragrance. Mentha \u00d7 gnaphaliflora is often used in aromatherapy and as a source of essential oils due to its high menthol content."
