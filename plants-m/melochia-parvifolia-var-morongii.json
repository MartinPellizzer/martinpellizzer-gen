    "intro": "Melochia parvifolia var. morongii, commonly known as the dwarf melochia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a round, green capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
