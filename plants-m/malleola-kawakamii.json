    "intro": "Malleola kawakamii, commonly known as the Kawakami's malleola, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in shaded forest understories, where it forms dense clusters near the base of trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malleola kawakamii is considered a vulnerable species."
