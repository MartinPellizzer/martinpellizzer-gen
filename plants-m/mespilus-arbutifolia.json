    "intro": "Mespilus arbutifolia, commonly known as the common mespilus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and thorny branches. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, yellow berries in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Mespilus arbutifolia is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
