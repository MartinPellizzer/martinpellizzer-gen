It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale blue. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed pods that contain tiny, spherical seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
