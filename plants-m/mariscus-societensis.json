    "intro": "Mariscus societensis, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen tree native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and its long, slender, spirally twisted leaves. The plant's bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against the harsh coastal climate. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
