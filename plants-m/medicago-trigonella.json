    "intro": "Medicago trigonella, commonly known as Turkish clover, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is widely used as a forage crop and in traditional medicine for its nutritional and medicinal properties. Medicago trigonella is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
