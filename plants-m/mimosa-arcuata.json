    "intro": "Mimosa arcuata, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its cascading, delicate foliage that resembles flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that appear in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods in summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, which are sensitive to touch and fold shut when disturbed. Mimosa arcuata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
