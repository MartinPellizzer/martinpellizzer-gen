    "intro": "Mikania pulverulenta var. typica, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a vigorous vine with heart-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas."
