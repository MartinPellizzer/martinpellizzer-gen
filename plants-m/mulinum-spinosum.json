    "intro": "Mulinum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its unique texture. Mulinum spinosum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
