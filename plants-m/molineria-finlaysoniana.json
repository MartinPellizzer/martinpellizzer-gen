    "intro": "Molineria finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
