    "intro": "Mallotus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
