    "intro": "Malus prasomila, commonly known as the Prasomila apple, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central China, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, sweet fruits that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it bears white flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malus prasomila is considered a conservation concern."
