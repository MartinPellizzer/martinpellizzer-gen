    "intro": "Macroptilium gracile var. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the silky trefoil, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in sandy or loamy soils. This variety is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and supports pollinators."
