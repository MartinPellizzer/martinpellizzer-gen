    "intro": "Mesechites subcarnosus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the summer months. Its growth habit is generally shrub-like, with multiple branches and a compact form. Mesechites subcarnosus is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a hardy species for xerophytic landscapes."
