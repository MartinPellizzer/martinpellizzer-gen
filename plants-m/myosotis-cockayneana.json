    "intro": "Myosotis cockayneana, commonly known as the Stewart's forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Myosotis cockayneana is a rare species, with limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role in New Zealand's flora."
