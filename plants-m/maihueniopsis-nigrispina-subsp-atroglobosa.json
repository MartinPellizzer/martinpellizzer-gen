    "intro": "Maihueniopsis nigrispina subsp. atroglobosa, commonly known as the black-spined marsh fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southern Andes. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds with a distinctive black or dark brown spore case. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its spores are released from the terminal, globose structures that are often hidden beneath the leaves. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
