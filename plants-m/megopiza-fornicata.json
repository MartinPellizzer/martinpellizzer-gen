    "intro": "Megopiza fornicata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, showy flower with a distinctive hood-like structure over the lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
