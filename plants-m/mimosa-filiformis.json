    "intro": "Mimosa filiformis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Mimosa filiformis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique and responsive foliage."
