    "intro": "Malvastrum mendocinense, commonly known as the Mendo marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to California. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wetland habitats and is adapted to moist, clay soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
