It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a minty fragrance and making it useful in herbal remedies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
