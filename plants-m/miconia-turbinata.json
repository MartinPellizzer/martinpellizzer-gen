    "intro": "Miconia turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often with a velvety underside. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
