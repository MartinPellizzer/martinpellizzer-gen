It is a shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, silky hairs. The leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a leathery texture. It produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native region."
