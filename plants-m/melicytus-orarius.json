    "intro": "Melicytus orarius, commonly known as the silver mist tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive, mist-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Melicytus orarius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
