    "intro": "Myoporum rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaf myoporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Myoporum rotundatum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal and dry areas."
