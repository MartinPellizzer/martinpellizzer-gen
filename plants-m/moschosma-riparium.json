    "intro": "Moschosma riparium, commonly known as the riverbank sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along rivers, streams, and ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. It plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its adaptability to fluctuating water levels makes it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
