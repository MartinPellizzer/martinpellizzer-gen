    "intro": "Monopteryx angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf monopteryx, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Menispermaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
