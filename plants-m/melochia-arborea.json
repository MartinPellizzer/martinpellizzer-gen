    "intro": "Melochia arborea, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid climates. Melochia arborea is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
