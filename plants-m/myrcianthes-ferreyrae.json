It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. It typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
