    "intro": "Myrcia eveae, commonly known as the Eve's myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain seeds, and the plant is often found in understory layers of dense tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, Myrcia eveae is considered a rare and endangered species."
