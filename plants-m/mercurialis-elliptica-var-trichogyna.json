    "intro": "Mercurialis elliptica var. trichogyna, commonly known as the hairy mercury plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
