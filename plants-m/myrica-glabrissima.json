    "intro": "Myrica glabrissima, commonly known as wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrant oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Myrica glabrissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
