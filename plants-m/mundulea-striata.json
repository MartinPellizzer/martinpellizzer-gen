    "intro": "Mundulea striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, linear stipules. The plant produces yellowish or pale green flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Mundulea striata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
