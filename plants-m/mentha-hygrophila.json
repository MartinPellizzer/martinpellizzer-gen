    "intro": "Mentha hygrophila, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist environments. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with fragrant, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in whorls, producing a distinctive menthol scent. Mentha hygrophila is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less common than other mint species."
