    "intro": "Macrosolen carinatulus, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, horn-like structures on its stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
