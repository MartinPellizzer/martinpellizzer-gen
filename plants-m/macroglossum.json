    "intro": "Macroglossum, commonly known as the giant bee moth, is a genus of moths belonging to the family Sphingidae. These insects are characterized by their large, robust bodies and long, narrow wings, which are often patterned with intricate designs. They are primarily nocturnal and are known for their ability to hover and feed on nectar from flowers. Macroglossum species are important pollinators, particularly for night-blooming plants. Their botanical significance lies in their role in pollination and their unique feeding habits that influence plant reproduction."
