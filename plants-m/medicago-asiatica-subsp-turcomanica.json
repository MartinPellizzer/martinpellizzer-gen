    "intro": "Medicago asiatica subsp. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turcoman milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
