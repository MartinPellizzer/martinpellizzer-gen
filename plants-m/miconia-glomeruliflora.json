It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a round, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. Miconia glomeruliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and showy inflorescences."
