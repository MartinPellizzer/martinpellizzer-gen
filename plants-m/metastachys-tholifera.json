    "intro": "Metastachys tholifera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and delicate, white to pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in pine flatwoods. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in several states."
