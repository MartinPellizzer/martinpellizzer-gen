    "intro": "Malaxis pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's Malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short-lived flower spike and produces a single, compact inflorescence. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to the cool and humid conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Malaxis pringlei is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed montane ecosystems."
