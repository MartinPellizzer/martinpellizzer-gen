    "intro": "Malaxis cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped, giving it its common name, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas or botanical gardens."
