    "intro": "Medicago intertexta var. muricoleptis, commonly known as the rough-leaved medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is used in ecological restoration projects. The variety muricoleptis is distinguished by its coarsely toothed leaves and robust growth habit."
