    "intro": "Manulea altissima subsp. glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed manulea, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind or specialized insects. Its growth is limited to high-altitude regions where the climate is cold and the soil is thin. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
