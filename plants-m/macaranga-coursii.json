    "intro": "Macaranga coursii, commonly known as the white-leaf macaranga, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white wax. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same inflorescence. The species is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
