    "intro": "Mammillaria senilis var. diguetii, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its pale green to blue-gray stems, which are covered in white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its textured foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
