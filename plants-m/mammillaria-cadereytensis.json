It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale green tubercles. The plant typically produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
