    "intro": "Mimosa cuzcoana, commonly known as the Cuzco mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Mimosa genus within the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species in its native range. Due to its unique characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or studied for its ecological role in its habitat."
