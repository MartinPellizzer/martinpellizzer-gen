    "intro": "Macrosolen splendidus, commonly known as the splendid sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily a wild species."
