    "intro": "Myricaria dahurica subsp. squamosa, commonly known as the sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-silver leaves covered in dense, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in elongated clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
