It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, followed by berries that turn red when mature. Megalopanax thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collections."
