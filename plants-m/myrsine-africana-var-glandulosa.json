    "intro": "Myrsine africana var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular myrsine, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with glandular dots on the surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The glandular structures on its leaves may play a role in chemical defense or attraction of pollinators."
