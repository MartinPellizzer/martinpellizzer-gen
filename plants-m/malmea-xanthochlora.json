    "intro": "Malmea xanthochlora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered malmea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant features small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the winter months. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the arid conditions of its native environment. Malmea xanthochlora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-resistant nature."
