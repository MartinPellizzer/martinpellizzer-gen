    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. pustariensis, commonly known as the woolly water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive silver-white, woolly underside on its leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, preferring cool and temperate climates. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover in damp areas."
