    "intro": "Mespilus chamaemespilus, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in late autumn, though they are typically harvested when they are partially decayed. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The common medlar is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
