It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that release small, black seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Melaleuca comboynensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and visual interest."
