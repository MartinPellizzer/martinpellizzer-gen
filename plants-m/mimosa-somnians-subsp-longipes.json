It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Its unique morphology and sensitive behavior make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
