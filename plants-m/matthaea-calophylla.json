    "intro": "Matthaea calophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Matthaea calophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
