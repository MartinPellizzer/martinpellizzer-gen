    "intro": "Magnolia biondii var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant purple in the autumn. The tree produces large, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the contrast between the purple foliage and the white blooms. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal color changes."
