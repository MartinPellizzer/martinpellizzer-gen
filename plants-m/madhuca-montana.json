    "intro": "Madhuca montana, commonly known as the hill mahua, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to local biodiversity."
