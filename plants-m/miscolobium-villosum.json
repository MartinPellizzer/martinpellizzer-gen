It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or brown, and they bloom in the spring. Miscolobium villosum is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
