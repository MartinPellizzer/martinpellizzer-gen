    "intro": "Mespilus nivea, commonly known as the white medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that ripen in the fall, though they are often not fully mature until after the first frost. The leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated edge, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
