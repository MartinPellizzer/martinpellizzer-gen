    "intro": "Mimosa schleidenii, commonly known as the Schleiden's mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and adaptive traits, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
