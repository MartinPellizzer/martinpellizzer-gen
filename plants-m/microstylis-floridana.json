    "intro": "Microstylis floridana, commonly known as the Florida microstylis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
