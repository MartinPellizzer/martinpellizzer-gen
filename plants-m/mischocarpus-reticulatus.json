    "intro": "Mischocarpus reticulatus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and aerial roots, which help it thrive in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Mischocarpus reticulatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine and terrestrial biodiversity."
