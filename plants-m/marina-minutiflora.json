    "intro": "Marina minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf sea hibiscus, is a coastal plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the summer. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and filter saltwater. Marina minutiflora is often found in dune habitats and is valued for its resilience to coastal conditions."
