    "intro": "Mammillaria parvissima, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 5 centimeters, with a compact, rounded shape. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy exterior. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful handling and specific care to thrive in cultivation."
