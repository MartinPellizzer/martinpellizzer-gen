    "intro": "Monstera pertusa var. modesta, commonly known as the modest monstera, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that exhibit a distinctive fenestrated pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves can reach up to 1 meter in length, and the plant thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. It is a popular houseplant due to its striking foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
