    "intro": "Mentzelia longiloba var. pinacatensis, commonly known as the desert bluemink, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
