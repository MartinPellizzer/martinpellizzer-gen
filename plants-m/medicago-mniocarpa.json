    "intro": "Medicago mniocarpa, commonly known as the small-flowered alfalfa, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop."
