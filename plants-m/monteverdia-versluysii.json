    "intro": "Monteverdia versluysii, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Peru and Ecuador. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species for botanical gardens and specialized collections. Monteverdia versluysii is also noted for its ability to produce attractive, long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
