    "intro": "Masdevallia campyloglossa subsp. ortgiesiana, commonly known as the Orchid Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, spurred flowers that range in color from deep purple to violet, with a unique, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments at high elevations. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and delicate species in botanical collections."
