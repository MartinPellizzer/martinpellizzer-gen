    "intro": "Mappa trichocarpa, commonly known as the California walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to seven leaflets, and its distinctive, elongated nuts enclosed in a rough, green husk. The tree produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of its edible nuts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodlands. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and supports a variety of wildlife."
