    "intro": "Micromeria danaensis, commonly known as the Dana's micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many well-known mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Micromeria danaensis is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
