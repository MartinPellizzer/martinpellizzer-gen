    "intro": "Microula tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan microula, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying plant resilience in extreme conditions."
