    "intro": "Maireana schistocarpa, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Maireana schistocarpa is often used in revegetation projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes."
