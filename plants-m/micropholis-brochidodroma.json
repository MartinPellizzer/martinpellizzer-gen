    "intro": "Micropholis brochidodroma, commonly known as the narrow-leafed brochidodroma, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
