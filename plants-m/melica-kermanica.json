    "intro": "Melica kermanica, commonly known as Kerman silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Melica kermanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and visual interest."
