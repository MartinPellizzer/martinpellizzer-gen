    "intro": "Micromelum curranii, commonly known as the Curran\u2019s holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
