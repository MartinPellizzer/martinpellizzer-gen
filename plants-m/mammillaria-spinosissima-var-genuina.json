    "intro": "Mammillaria spinosissima var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that give it a soft, almost fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor succulent collections."
