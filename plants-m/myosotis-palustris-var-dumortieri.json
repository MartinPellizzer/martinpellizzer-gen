It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. The plant produces small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, typical of the Myosotis genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
