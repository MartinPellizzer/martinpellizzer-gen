    "intro": "Macaranga angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf macaranga, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Macaranga angustifolia is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain species of ants."
