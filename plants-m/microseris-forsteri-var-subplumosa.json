    "intro": "Microseris forsteri var. subplumosa, commonly known as the plumose sandstem, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, elongated seed heads that are covered in fine, feathery bristles, which aid in wind dispersal. This variety is distinguished by its more loosely arranged, plumose (feathery) appearance compared to other varieties of Microseris."
