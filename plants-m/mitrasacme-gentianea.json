    "intro": "Mitrasacme gentianea, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
