    "intro": "Microphyes minima, commonly known as the dwarf microphyes, is a small flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Microphyesaceae and is characterized by its tiny, delicate leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or near streams. Its botanical features include a short stem, clustered leaves, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
