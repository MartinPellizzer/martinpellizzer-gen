It is characterized by its ornamental white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are often used in jams and jellies. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest. Malus grandiflora is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks."
