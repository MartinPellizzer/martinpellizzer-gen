    "intro": "Myriophyllum limosum, commonly known as water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across North America. It has feathery, branching leaves that are typically green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, often floating at the water\u2019s surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for fish and invertebrates. Myriophyllum limosum is also used in traditional medicine and can be invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
