    "intro": "Melocactus zehntneri var. curvicornis, commonly known as the narrow-horned melocactus, is a columnar cactus native to southern Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a distinctive, narrow central spines that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
