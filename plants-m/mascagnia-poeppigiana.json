    "intro": "Mascagnia poeppigiana, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can withstand extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are often thick and waxy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains seeds, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
