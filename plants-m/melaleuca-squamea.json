It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine, scale-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Melaleuca squamea is often found in heathlands and is adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions."
