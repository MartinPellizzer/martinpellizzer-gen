It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. The seeds, known as nutmeg, are encased in a reddish outer layer called mace. This species is valued for its aromatic seeds, which are used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
