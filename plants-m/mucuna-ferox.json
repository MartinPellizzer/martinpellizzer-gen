    "intro": "Mucuna ferox, commonly known as the devil's bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, often hairy, pods that contain numerous seeds. The plant produces a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fallows and roadsides. Mucuna ferox is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
