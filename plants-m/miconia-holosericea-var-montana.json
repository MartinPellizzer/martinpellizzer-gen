    "intro": "Miconia holosericea var. montana, commonly known as the mountain miconia, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, cool climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
