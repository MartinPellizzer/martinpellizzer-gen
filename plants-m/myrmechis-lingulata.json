    "intro": "Myrmechis lingulata, commonly known as the slender leafed myrmechis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open forests. Myrmechis lingulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
