    "intro": "Marianthemum grandiflorum, commonly known as the grandiflorous marsh-plant, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in the northern hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
