    "intro": "Medicago agropyretorum var. inundata, commonly known as the water medick, is a perennial legume native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to moist environments and has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Its variability in growth form and habitat preference makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
