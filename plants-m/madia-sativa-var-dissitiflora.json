It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used historically by indigenous peoples for fiber and medicinal purposes."
