    "intro": "Melaleuca pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Melaleuca pauciflora is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
