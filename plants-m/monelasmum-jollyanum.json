    "intro": "Monelasmum jollyanum, commonly known as the Jolly's monelasmum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
