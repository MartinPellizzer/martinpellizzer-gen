    "intro": "Monanthes atlantica var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow Atlantic monanthes, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it thrives in salty and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
