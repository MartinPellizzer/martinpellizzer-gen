    "intro": "Minuartia yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Yukon sandwort plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and subarctic regions."
