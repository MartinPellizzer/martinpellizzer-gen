    "intro": "Melampyrum montanum subsp. scotianum, commonly known as the Scottish touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a herbaceous perennial with erect, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland and heathland habitats. Its name derives from the Greek words for \"yellow\" and \"to touch,\" likely referring to the way its flowers appear to beckon the touch of pollinators."
