It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pointed at the tips, giving it its specific epithet *acutifolia*. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, similar to other mint species."
