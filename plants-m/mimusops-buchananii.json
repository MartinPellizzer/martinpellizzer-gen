It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and riverine habitats."
