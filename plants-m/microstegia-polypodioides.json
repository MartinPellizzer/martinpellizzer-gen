    "intro": "Microstegia polypodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that produce small, pinnate leaves with a feathery appearance. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, with a soft, glossy texture. Microstegia polypodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
