    "intro": "Mentzelia grisebachii, commonly known as gray mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally hairy and have a grayish-green color, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Mentzelia grisebachii is part of the family Loasaceae and is known for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
