    "intro": "Mimosa nossibiensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves seasonally, and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in coastal or dry forest environments. The species is noted for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
