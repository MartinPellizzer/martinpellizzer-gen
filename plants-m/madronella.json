    "intro": "Madronella, commonly known as the madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that attract various wildlife. Its leaves are broad and oval, turning bright red in the fall before dropping. The madrone is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
