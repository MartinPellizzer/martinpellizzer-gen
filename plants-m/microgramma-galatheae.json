    "intro": "Microgramma galatheae, commonly known as the Galathea spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy appearance. Microgramma galatheae is notable for its intricate spore-producing structures, which are clustered in small, rounded sorus on the underside of its leaves."
