    "intro": "Macrozamia johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the female cones bearing seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored sarcotesta. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
