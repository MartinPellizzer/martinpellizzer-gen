    "intro": "Mertensia muriculata, commonly known as the prickly pear or mountain mertensia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spiny leaves and produces striking blue-violet flowers in early spring. The plant belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
