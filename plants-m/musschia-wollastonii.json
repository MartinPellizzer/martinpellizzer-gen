    "intro": "Musschia wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed, dark green leaves that are usually curved at the tips. Its spores are produced in capsules that are borne on short, erect stalks. Musschia wollastonii is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates."
