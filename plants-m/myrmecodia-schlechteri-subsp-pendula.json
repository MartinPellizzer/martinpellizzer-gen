It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow cavities of its stems. Its leaves are small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a spiral pattern, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is notable for its pendulous growth habit, making it an attractive specimen for hanging baskets or specialized plant displays."
