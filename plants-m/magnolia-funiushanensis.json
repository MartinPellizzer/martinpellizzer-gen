    "intro": "Magnolia funiushanensis, commonly known as the Funiushan magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with moist, well-drained soils and a cool climate. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
