    "intro": "Macropeplus ligustrinus var. rhomboideus, commonly known as the rhomboid leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. The plant has opposite, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and disturbed areas due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
