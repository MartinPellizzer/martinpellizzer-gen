    "intro": "Masdevallia carrilloana, commonly known as the Carrillo's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
