    "intro": "Manulea crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline manulea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its translucent, glass-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant's structure consists of delicate, branching stems covered in a waxy, crystalline coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture to survive. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
