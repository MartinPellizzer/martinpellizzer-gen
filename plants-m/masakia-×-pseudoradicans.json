    "intro": "Masakia \u00d7 pseudoradicans, commonly known as the hybrid milkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a distinguishing feature of the genus. Masakia \u00d7 pseudoradicans is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
