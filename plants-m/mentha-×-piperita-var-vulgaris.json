    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 piperita var. vulgaris, commonly known as peppermint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its strong, refreshing aroma and cooling menthol content. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and temperate climates. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters. Peppermint is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy, medicine, and flavoring. Its vigorous growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a popular but sometimes invasive species in gardens."
