    "intro": "Miconia affinis, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange or red fruits containing numerous seeds. Miconia affinis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers in invaded areas."
