    "intro": "Melaleuca macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin, papery layers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white tomentum. It produces small, white to cream-colored flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in spring. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains numerous seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
