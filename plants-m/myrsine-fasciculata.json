It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans.
