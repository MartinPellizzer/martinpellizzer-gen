    "intro": "Mikania claussenii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
