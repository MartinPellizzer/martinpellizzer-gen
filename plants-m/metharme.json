It belongs to the Amaryllis family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to harsh desert conditions. Its roots are deep and robust, allowing it to access underground moisture. Metharme is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
