    "intro": "Macrochlamys involucratus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the wet season. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as hibiscus and cotton. Macrochlamys involucratus is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
