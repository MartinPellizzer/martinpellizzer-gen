    "intro": "Mammillaria aurea, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly cylindrical shape and is covered in dense, white to yellowish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Mammillaria aurea is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
