    "intro": "Mimusops obovata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, obovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, often blooming during the dry season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental horticulture."
