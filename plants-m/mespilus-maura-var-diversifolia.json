    "intro": "Mespilus maura var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variegated medlar, is a rare and ornamental variant of the medlar tree. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring white and green patterns on its leaves. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It produces small, edible fruits that ripen in late autumn, though they are not widely cultivated for food. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often grown in botanical gardens for its aesthetic value."
