    "intro": "Minuartia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sand-flower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with a shallow root system and succulent tissues that store water. It often thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, commonly found in mountainous regions. Minuartia brevifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
