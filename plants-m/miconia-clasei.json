    "intro": "Miconia clasei, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
