    "intro": "Mikania vitrea, commonly known as the glassy morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that reflect light, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb various structures make it a common sight in disturbed habitats. Mikania vitrea is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
