    "intro": "Myrtus crenulata, commonly known as the wrinkled myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features fragrant, dark green leaves with a distinctive wavy or wrinkled texture. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Myrtus crenulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges or as a specimen plant."
