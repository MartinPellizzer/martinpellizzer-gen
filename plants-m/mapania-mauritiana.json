    "intro": "Mapania mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius starling tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it a subject of conservation interest."
