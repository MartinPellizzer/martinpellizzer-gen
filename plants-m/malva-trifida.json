    "intro": "Malva trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces showy, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves are covered in fine pubescence, a feature common in the Malvaceae family. Malva trifida is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
