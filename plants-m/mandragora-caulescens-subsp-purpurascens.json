    "intro": "Mandragora caulescens subsp. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered mandrake, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive, reddish-purple flowers and its somewhat toxic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are alternate and have a slightly lobed appearance, while its stems are often branched and hairy. This subspecies is valued in both traditional medicine and horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
