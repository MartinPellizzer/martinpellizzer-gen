    "intro": "Mimosa sparsiformis, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. Mimosa sparsiformis is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
