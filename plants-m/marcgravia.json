    "intro": "Marcgravia, commonly known as the \"silk floss plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and Central and South America. They are characterized by their showy, often velvety bracts that resemble soft, fuzzy structures, which are actually modified leaves. Marcgravia species typically have opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are well-suited to warm, humid environments."
