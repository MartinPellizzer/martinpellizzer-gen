    "intro": "Mastichodendron foetidissimum var. gaumeri, commonly known as the stinking mastichodendron, is a rare and unique plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pungent odor, which is released from its glandular leaves and stems. The plant belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other aromatic and sometimes toxic species. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a rough, leathery texture. This variant is notable for its strong, unpleasant smell, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
