It is characterized by its dark purple to black foliage, which distinguishes it from other mint varieties. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with square stems and opposite leaves. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. Mentha \u00d7 controversa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a more intense, spicy aroma compared to common mints."
