    "intro": "Mammillaria schumannii var. globosa, commonly known as the globular mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense cluster of short, rounded spines and is characterized by its small, pale green to blue-gray stems. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
