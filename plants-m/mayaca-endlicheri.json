    "intro": "Mayaca endlicheri, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense canopy on the water surface. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Mayaca endlicheri plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
