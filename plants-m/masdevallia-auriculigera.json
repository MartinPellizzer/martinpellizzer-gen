    "intro": "Masdevallia auriculigera, commonly known as the auriculate masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, ear-shaped petals and a compact, pseudobulbous structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock surfaces or in the understory of dense vegetation. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom during the cooler months, and it requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. This species is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
