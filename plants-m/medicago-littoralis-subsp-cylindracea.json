    "intro": "Medicago littoralis subsp. cylindracea, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecological succession."
