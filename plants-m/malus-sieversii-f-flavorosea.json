    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. flavorosea, commonly known as the flavorosea apple, is a rare and unique variant of the wild apple species native to Central Asia. This fruiting form is characterized by its distinctive, sweet and aromatic flavor, which sets it apart from other apple cultivars. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, where it thrives in cooler climates and well-drained soils. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, while its flowers are white and fragrant, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is considered a valuable genetic resource for apple breeding programs."
