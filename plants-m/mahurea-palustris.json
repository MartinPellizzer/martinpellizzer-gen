    "intro": "Mahurea palustris, commonly known as the swamp mahurea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, acidic soils along the edges of swamps, marshes, and tidal flats. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy, blue-green surface. Its flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, producing tiny, greenish-white blooms that are often overlooked but are important for pollinators. Mahurea palustris plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
