    "intro": "Muscarella segregatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved muscarine mushroom, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Agaricaceae. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped cap that becomes convex with age, and its pale yellow to cream-colored gills. The mushroom contains muscarine, a psychoactive compound that can cause hallucinations and other effects when ingested. It is typically found in grassy areas and is often associated with decaying wood. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid consuming this species."
