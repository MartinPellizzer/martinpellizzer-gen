    "intro": "Malaisia, commonly known as the \"scented orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where they thrive in tropical rainforests. Malaisia species are characterized by their delicate, fragrant flowers that often display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to their ornamental value and limited distribution, many species of Malaisia are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
