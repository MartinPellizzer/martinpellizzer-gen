    "intro": "Mimosa capitata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in touch, light, or temperature. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which are followed by bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens around the world."
