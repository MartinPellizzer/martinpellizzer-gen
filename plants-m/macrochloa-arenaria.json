It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Macrochloa arenaria is often found in sandy soils and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
