    "intro": "Masdevallia stigii, commonly known as the Stigii masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, velvety petals and sepals, often displaying vibrant hues of red, purple, and pink. This species thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting its unique growth habit. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
