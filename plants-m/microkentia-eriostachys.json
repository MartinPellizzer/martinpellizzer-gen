It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown surface and produces feather-like, pale green fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and prefers bright, indirect light with moderate humidity. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions. Microkentia eriostachys is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in small spaces."
