    "intro": "Microsorum pitcairnense, commonly known as the Pitcairn fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the island of Pitcairn in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that often form a dense, floating mat on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas efficiently. Microsorum pitcairnense is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
