    "intro": "Milium tenellum, commonly known as the slender millet, is a small, herbaceous annual plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Milium tenellum is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its fine texture and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
