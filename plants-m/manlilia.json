    "intro": "Manlilia, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often resemble butterflies or birds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Manlilia species have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air. These plants are valued not only for their ornamental beauty but also for their cultural significance in Filipino traditions."
