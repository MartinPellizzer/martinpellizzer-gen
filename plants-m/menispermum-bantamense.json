    "intro": "Menispermum bantamense, commonly known as Bantam arrowroot, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Menispermaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous if ingested. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to their toxicity. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
