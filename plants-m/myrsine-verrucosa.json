It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, raised dots, giving it a rough texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. Myrsine verrucosa is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
