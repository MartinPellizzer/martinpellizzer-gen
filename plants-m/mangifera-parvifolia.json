    "intro": "Mangifera parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved mango, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is typically small, with a thin, fibrous skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Despite its ornamental value, it is less commonly cultivated for fruit production compared to other mango species."
