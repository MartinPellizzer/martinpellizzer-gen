    "intro": "Myriopteris aurea, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue on the underside. Native to the eastern United States, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive biology."
