    "intro": "Maba palauensis, commonly known as the Palau maba, is a small tree native to the islands of Palau in the western Pacific. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures, and its fruits are capsule-like, containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Palau maba is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
