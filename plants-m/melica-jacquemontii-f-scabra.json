    "intro": "Melica jacquemontii f. scabra, commonly known as the scabrous meadowgrass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine, rough hairs, giving it a scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in its native environment."
