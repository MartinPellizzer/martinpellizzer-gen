    "intro": "Mikania eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a climbing vine that produces small, tubular flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white to purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural habitats."
