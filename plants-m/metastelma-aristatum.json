    "intro": "Metastelma aristatum, commonly known as the feathered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as ceiba and mahogany, using haustoria to draw water and nutrients. Its berries are red and contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Due to habitat loss, Metastelma aristatum is considered vulnerable and faces conservation challenges."
