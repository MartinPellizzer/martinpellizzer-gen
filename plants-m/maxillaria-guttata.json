    "intro": "Maxillaria guttata, commonly known as the spotted maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and purple. The plant features elliptical, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, and its pseudobulbs are often covered in a distinctive white or pale green bloom. Maxillaria guttata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and greenhouse environments due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
