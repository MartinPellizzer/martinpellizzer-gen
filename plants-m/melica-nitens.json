    "intro": "Melica nitens, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica nitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
