    "intro": "Mentzelia argillosa, commonly known as clay-plant or clay lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in clay soils. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mentzelia argillosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
