    "intro": "Melaleuca nodosa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its bark is fibrous and peels off in thin, papery layers, giving it the common name. This species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
