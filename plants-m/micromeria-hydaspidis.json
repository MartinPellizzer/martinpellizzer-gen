    "intro": "Micromeria hydaspidis, commonly known as the water micromeria, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray. It is often found in association with other coastal flora such as Eschscholzia californica and other members of the Boraginaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
