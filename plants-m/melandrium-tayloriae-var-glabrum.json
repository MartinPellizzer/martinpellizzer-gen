It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
