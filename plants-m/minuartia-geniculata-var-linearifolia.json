    "intro": "Minuartia geniculata var. linearifolia, commonly known as the slender rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on slopes or among stones. This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Minuartia, which are known for their ability to survive in extreme climates."
