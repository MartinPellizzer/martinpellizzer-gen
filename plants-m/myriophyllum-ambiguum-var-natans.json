It has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are often hidden beneath the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation, impacting water quality and aquatic habitats."
