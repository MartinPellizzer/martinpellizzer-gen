    "intro": "Meliosma impressa, commonly known as the velvetleaf maple, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, palmately compound leaves that are typically 5\u20139 cm in length, with a distinctive velvety texture on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
