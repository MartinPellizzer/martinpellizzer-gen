    "intro": "Miconia vallensis, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Miconia vallensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks. It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
