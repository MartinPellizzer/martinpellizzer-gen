    "intro": "Mabrya, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. They typically have hairy stems and leaves, adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. Mabrya species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
