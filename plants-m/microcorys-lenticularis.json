It is characterized by its small, flattened, and often lens-shaped thallus, which is typically green and covered with small, rounded papillae. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a central axis with lateral branches, and it reproduces through spores released from capsules. Microcorys lenticularis is a cryptogamic plant that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms."
