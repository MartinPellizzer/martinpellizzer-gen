    "intro": "Melocactus extensus, commonly known as the extended melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, edible fruits. Its spines are relatively short and dense, providing protection while allowing for good air circulation. Melocactus extensus is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
