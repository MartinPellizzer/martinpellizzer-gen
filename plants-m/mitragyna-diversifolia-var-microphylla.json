    "intro": "Mitragyna diversifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the lesser kratom, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue to black oval berries. Its leaves contain alkaloids, similar to other kratom species, though research on its specific chemical composition is limited. It is often cultivated for both ornamental and potential medicinal purposes."
