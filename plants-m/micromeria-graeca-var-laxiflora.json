It features small, aromatic leaves with a grayish-green hue, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
