It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitats."
