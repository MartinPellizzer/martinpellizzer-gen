    "intro": "Maytenus grenadensis, commonly known as the Grenada mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Grenada and surrounding islands. It belongs to the family Cornaceae, which includes willows and related plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Maytenus grenadensis plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
