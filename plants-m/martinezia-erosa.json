    "intro": "Martinezia erosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Martinezia erosa plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert wildlife species."
