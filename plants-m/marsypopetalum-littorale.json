    "intro": "Marsypopetalum littorale, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along the shoreline. The plant features a low-growing stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive ray floret structure, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
