It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in fen and marsh environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
