    "intro": "Melica simulans, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a clump-forming growth habit. Melica simulans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
