    "intro": "Miconia leatetragona, commonly known as the four-angled miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive four-angled stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia leatetragona is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
