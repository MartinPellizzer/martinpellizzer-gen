    "intro": "Maerua boranensis, commonly known as the Boran thornbush, is a shrub native to the Horn of Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, spine-tipped leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to harsh conditions. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Maerua boranensis plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including medicinal applications."
