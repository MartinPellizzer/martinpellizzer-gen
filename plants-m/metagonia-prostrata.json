    "intro": "Metagonia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate metagonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes."
