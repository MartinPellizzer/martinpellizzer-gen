    "intro": "Minuartia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has a cushion-like growth form, with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, rounded seed pods. Minuartia glandulosa is often found on rocky substrates and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited soil nutrients."
