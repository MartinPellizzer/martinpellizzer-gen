    "intro": "Melampyrum arvense proles pseudobarbatum, commonly known as false toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and woodland edges."
