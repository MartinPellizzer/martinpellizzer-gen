    "intro": "Mimosa callithrix, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
