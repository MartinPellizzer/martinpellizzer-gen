    "intro": "Melilotus kochianus, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Melilotus kochianus is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and high biomass production."
