    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum deltoides var. majus, commonly known as the diamond flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but numerous. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for Mediterranean and arid climate gardens."
