    "intro": "Macrosamanea duckei, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested, making it a plant to handle with care."
