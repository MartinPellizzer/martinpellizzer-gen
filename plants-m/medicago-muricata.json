    "intro": "Medicago muricata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers and pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Medicago muricata is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
