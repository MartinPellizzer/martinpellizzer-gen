    "intro": "Matucana haynii subsp. hystrix, commonly known as the hystrix matucana, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by spiny, ribbed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
