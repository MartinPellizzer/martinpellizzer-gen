    "intro": "Melaleuca trichophylla, commonly known as the silver bottlebrush, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and showy, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant produces small, woody fruits called capsules, which release seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Melaleuca trichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
