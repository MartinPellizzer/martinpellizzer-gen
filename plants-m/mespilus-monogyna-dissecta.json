    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna dissecta, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often deeply dissected, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that turn from green to red or yellow as they mature. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree can reach heights of up to 10 meters. It is often cultivated for its fruit and has been introduced to various regions for ornamental and agricultural purposes."
