It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers with distinctive red spots, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats like stream banks and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall appearance. Mimulus mephiticus plays an important role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinator populations and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
