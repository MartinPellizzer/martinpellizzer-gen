    "intro": "Maytenus variabilis, commonly known as the variable mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Maytenus variabilis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making."
