    "intro": "Mogorium multiflorum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overshadowed by the vibrant, colorful bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Mogorium multiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant."
