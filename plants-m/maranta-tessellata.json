    "intro": "Maranta tessellata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a striking member of the Marantaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, mottled leaves that display a unique pattern of green, red, and purple hues, which intensify in low light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Maranta tessellata is a rhizomatous perennial that thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its foliage is not only ornamental but also exhibits a fascinating phenomenon called nyctinasty, where the leaves fold shut at night."
