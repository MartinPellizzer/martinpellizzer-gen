    "intro": "Macrosolen tetragonus, commonly known as the four-angled macrolen, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its square or four-angled stems, which are a distinguishing feature of the genus Macrosolen. The plant typically has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, attracting various pollinators. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
