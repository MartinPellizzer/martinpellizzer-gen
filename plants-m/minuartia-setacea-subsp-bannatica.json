It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
