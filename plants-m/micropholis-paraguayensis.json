    "intro": "Micropholis paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay micropholis, is a small evergreen tree native to South America, particularly found in Paraguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and guava. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native region."
