    "intro": "Maguirea, commonly known as the goldenrods, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or golden inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small flowers arranged in a composite head. Maguirea species are typically herbaceous, with lance-shaped leaves and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. They are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks in temperate regions. The genus includes several species, such as Maguirea fluitans, which is native to North America."
