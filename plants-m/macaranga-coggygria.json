    "intro": "Macaranga coggygria, commonly known as the white sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable species for reforestation and a potential invasive plant in certain areas."
