    "intro": "Mikania arborea, commonly known as the tree morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rapid growth and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, spiny capsule that bursts open when mature. Mikania arborea is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
