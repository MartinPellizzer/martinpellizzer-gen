    "intro": "Muhlenbergia inaequalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue-gray on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental quality to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological value includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
