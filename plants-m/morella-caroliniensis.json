    "intro": "Morella caroliniensis, commonly known as the Carolina wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, wax-coated berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The aromatic leaves and berries have been used historically by Native American tribes for various medicinal and practical purposes."
