    "intro": "Miscanthus fuscus, commonly known as black miscanthus, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and silvery-gray foliage that turns reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces panicles of small, feathery flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide texture and color throughout the growing season."
