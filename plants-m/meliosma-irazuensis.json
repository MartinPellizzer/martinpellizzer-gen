It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
