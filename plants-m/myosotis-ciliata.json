    "intro": "Myosotis ciliata, commonly known as the fringed mouse-eared cowslip, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with finely toothed edges, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Myosotis ciliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also studied for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
