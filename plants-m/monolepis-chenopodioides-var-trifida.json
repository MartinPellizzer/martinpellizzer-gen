    "intro": "Monolepis chenopodioides var. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed goosefoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring succulent, trifid (three-lobed) leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, lemony-tasting seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance and nutritional value, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
