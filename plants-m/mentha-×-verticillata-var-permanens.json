    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. permanens, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common wetland plant."
