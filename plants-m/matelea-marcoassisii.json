    "intro": "Matelea marcoassisii, commonly known as Marco's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as dense forests or undergrowth. Its leaves are ovate with a velvety texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
