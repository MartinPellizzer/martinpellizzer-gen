    "intro": "Mimosa bimucronata armata, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
