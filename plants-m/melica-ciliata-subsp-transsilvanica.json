It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with ciliate margins. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
