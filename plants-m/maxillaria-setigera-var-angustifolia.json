    "intro": "Maxillaria setigera var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive lip that is adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
