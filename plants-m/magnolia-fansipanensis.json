    "intro": "Magnolia fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fan Mountain magnolia, is a rare and striking species native to Vietnam. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of its heart-shaped leaves. The plant is typically found in mountainous regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its bark is smooth and grey, while its leaves are thick and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered an endangered species."
