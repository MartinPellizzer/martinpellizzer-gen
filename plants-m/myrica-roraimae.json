    "intro": "Myrica roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima wax myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the Myricaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northern South America, particularly in the region around the Roraima plateau in Venezuela and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded understory environments. The plant has limited commercial use but is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
