    "intro": "Mentha densiflora, commonly known as dense-flower mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and dense clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has a strong, minty aroma due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mentha densiflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
