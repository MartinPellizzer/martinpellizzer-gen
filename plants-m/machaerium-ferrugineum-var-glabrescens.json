    "intro": "Machaerium ferrugineum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvet false pigeon pea, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) foliage and cylindrical, often spiny pods that contain small, dark seeds. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small white or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
