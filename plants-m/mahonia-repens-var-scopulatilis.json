    "intro": "Mahonia repens var. scopulatilis, commonly known as the creeping mahonia, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features woody stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces dark green, leathery leaves with spiny margins, and it blooms with yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. Its berries, which are dark blue to black, are an important food source for birds and small mammals. This variant is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
