It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that resemble small lanterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with a distinctive, spurred shape that aids in pollination by insects.
