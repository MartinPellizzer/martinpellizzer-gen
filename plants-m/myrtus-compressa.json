    "intro": "Myrtus compressa, commonly known as dwarf myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. Myrtus compressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges or as a container plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
