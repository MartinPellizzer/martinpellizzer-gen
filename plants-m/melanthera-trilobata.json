    "intro": "Melanthera trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have three distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. Melanthera trilobata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
