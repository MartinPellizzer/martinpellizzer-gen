    "intro": "Microgramma chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. The golden fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
