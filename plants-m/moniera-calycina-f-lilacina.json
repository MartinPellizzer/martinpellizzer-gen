It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its showy, lilac-colored inflorescences that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual appeal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral features, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
