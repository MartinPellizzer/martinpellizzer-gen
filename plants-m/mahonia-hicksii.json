    "intro": "Mahonia hicksii, commonly known as the hickory-leaf mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble hickory leaves, with dark green, glossy foliage that turns yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and seasonal blooms."
