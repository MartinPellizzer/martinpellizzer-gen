    "intro": "Melastoma annulatum, commonly known as the red-flowered melastoma, is a perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
