    "intro": "Manostachya staelioides, commonly known as the Stael's manostachya, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
