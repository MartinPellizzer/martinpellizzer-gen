    "intro": "Myriophyllum striatocarpum, commonly known as narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It is often found in quiet lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it can form dense underwater stands. Myriophyllum striatocarpum plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and young fish."
