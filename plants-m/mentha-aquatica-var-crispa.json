    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. crispa, commonly known as water mint with crisped leaves, is a perennial herb native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and serrated, slightly curled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in wet soils near streams, ponds, and damp meadows, making it a common sight in aquatic habitats. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, contributing to its use in herbal remedies and aromatherapy."
