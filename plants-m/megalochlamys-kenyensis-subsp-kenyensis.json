    "intro": "Megalochlamys kenyensis subsp. kenyensis, commonly known as the Kenyan megalochlamys, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with four to five petals, and are clustered in inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests or grasslands. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
