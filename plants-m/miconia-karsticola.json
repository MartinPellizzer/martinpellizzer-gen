It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It produces berries that are often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
