    "intro": "Marathrum cheiriferum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Marathrum cheiriferum is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient and visually appealing species in desert ecosystems."
