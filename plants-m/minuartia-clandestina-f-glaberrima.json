    "intro": "Minuartia clandestina f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant typically forms a dense mat of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and is often found in crevices or on sunny slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ability to survive in harsh conditions, it is a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
