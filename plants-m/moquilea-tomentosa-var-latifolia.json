    "intro": "Moquilea tomentosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved moquilea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional uses in local communities."
