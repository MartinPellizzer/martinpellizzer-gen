    "intro": "Matricaria maritima var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf seaside daisy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features compact, bushy foliage with small, bright yellow flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to salty, sandy soils and can tolerate maritime conditions such as sea spray and strong winds. Its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
