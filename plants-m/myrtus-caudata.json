It is characterized by its dense, grayish-blue foliage with a soft, woolly texture on the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries. Myrtus caudata is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade."
