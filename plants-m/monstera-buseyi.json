    "intro": "Monstera buseyi, commonly known as the Buse's monstera, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop distinctive holes and splits as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
