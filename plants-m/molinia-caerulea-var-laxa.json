    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. laxa, commonly known as the loose moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and heathlands. Due to its ability to tolerate wet conditions, it is a common indicator species in peatland ecosystems."
