    "intro": "Mimusops jaimiqui, commonly known as the Jaimiqui tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Its bark is thick and rough, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. The Jaimiqui tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and has limited use in traditional medicine."
