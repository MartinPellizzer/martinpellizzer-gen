    "intro": "Molinia caerulea subsp. arundinacea, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking purple to silver-colored inflorescences. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the flowering stems are often taller than the foliage. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and supporting biodiversity."
