    "intro": "Myrcia pallens var. subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate myrtle, is a shrub native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native gardens."
