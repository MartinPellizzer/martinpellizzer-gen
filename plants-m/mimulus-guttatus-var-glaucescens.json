    "intro": "Mimulus guttatus var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which are typically tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, providing some protection against drought. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and meadows. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
