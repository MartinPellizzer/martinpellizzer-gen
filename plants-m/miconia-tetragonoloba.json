    "intro": "Miconia tetragonoloba, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems."
