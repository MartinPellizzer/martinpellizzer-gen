It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that open in response to light. The plant produces small, orange-yellow fruits that are edible and resemble tiny tomatoes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves.
