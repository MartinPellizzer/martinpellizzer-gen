    "intro": "Monotagma humile, commonly known as the small-leaved monocot, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
