    "intro": "Malortiea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a small, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Malortiea pumila is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar characteristics."
