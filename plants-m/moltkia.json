    "intro": "Moltkia, commonly known as the sweet milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals but can be used in traditional medicine. The plants typically have alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. Moltkia species are native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
