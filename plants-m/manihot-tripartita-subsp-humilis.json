It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
