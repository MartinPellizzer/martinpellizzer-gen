    "intro": "Myrica, commonly known as wax myrtle or sweet pepper bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myricaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic leaves and berries. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in wetlands or along coastal areas. Myrica species have small, usually white or yellowish flowers and produce fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. The plant's waxy leaves and fragrant oils make it notable in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
