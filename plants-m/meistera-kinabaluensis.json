    "intro": "Meistera kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Borneo arrowroot, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrowhead-shaped leaves and showy inflorescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its mountainous habitat. Its growth is slow, and it is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
