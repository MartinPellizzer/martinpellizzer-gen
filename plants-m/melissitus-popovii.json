    "intro": "Melissitus popovii, commonly known as the Popov's melissitus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
