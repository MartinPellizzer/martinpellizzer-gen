    "intro": "Maranta gratiosa, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often display shades of green, white, and pink. The plant's unique feature is its leaves, which fold upwards at night, resembling prayer hands, hence its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Maranta gratiosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
