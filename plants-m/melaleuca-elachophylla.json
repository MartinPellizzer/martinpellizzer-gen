    "intro": "Melaleuca elachophylla, commonly known as the silver bottle tree, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. The plant is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and its unique bottle-shaped trunk, which stores water. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects."
