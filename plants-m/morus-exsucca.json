    "intro": "Morus exsucca, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, fuzzy fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fibrous bark, which is used in papermaking. The tree is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food for silkworms."
