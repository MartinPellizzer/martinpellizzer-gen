    "intro": "Mycaranthes lobata, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a woody stem and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
