This plant belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive floral structures. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, adapting to the harsh maritime environment. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
