    "intro": "Macroclinium ramonense, commonly known as the Ramon's spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spider-like flowers with long, slender petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
