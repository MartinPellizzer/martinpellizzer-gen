    "intro": "Malus communis var. gellida, commonly known as the Gellida apple, is a cultivar of the apple tree native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits with a high acidity level, making it suitable for cooking and cider production. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, while its flowers are white and appear in clusters during early spring. The Gellida apple is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
