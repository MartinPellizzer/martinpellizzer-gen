    "intro": "Myosotis pusilla var. perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf forget-me-not, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 5 to 15 centimeters and features delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
