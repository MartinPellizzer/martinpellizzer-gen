It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves and yellowish-green sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
