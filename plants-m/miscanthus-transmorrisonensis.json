    "intro": "Miscanthus transmorrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's miscanthus, is a perennial grass native to China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that appear in the fall. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream edges. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
