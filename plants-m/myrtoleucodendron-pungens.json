    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron pungens, commonly known as the pungent myrtle-leaved tree, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves that emit a distinct scent when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its growth habit is primarily shrub-like, with a compact form and dense foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
