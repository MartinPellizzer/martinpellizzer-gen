    "intro": "Mapania glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's mapania, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. Native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, it is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered in its native environment."
