    "intro": "Misanteca jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as ceiba and mahogany. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the rainy season. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife while also relying on host plants for nutrients."
