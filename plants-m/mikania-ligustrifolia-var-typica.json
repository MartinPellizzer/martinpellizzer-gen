    "intro": "Mikania ligustrifolia var. typica, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves with a rough texture and a distinct waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the morning. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb or trail make it a common ornamental and invasive species in tropical and subtropical regions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution and ecological impact."
