    "intro": "Mikania leptotricha, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the stems are slender and often twine around supporting structures. Mikania leptotricha is often considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range due to its aggressive growth habit."
