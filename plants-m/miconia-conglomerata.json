    "intro": "Miconia conglomerata, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, round, orange-red fruits. Miconia conglomerata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can dominate forest understories. Its ecological impact is significant, as it can outcompete native species and alter local ecosystems."
