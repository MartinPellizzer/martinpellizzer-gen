    "intro": "Microchilus curvatus, commonly known as the curved-lobed orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, where it thrives in the dappled light of the understory. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive curved lip. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
