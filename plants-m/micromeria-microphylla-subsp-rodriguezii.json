    "intro": "Micromeria microphylla subsp. rodriguezii, commonly known as Rodriguez's narrowleaf micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, shrub-like species characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in dry environments. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to arid conditions, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
