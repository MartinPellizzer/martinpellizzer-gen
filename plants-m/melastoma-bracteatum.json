    "intro": "Melastoma bracteatum, commonly known as the purple false heather, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Melastoma bracteatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
