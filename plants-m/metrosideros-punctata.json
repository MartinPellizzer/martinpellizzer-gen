It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often around December, hence its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture, while the bark is smooth and reddish-brown. It thrives in coastal and moist forest environments, and its flowers attract a variety of pollinators. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
