    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. agrestis, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Field mint is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used historically in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb."
