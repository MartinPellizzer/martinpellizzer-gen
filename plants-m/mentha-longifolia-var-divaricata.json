    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. divaricata, commonly known as the creeping mint, is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing growth habit and aromatic leaves. It features slender, often hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a pointed tip and a serrated edge, and emit a strong menthol scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common garden and wild plant in temperate regions. This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other mint species."
