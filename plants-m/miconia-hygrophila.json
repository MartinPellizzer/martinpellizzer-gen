    "intro": "Miconia hygrophila, commonly known as the water miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow or orange berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
