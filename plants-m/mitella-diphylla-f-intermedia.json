It is characterized by its distinctive two-lipped, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
