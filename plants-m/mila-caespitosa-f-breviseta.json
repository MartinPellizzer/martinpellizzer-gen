    "intro": "Mila caespitosa f. breviseta, commonly known as the compact mila, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Andes. It features dense, upright shoots with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
