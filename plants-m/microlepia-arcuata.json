    "intro": "Microlepia arcuata, commonly known as the curved microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce clusters of small, bright green leaves. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
