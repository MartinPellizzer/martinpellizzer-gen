    "intro": "Macrolobium klainei, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a thick, spongy leaf structure that provides buoyancy and supports the weight of small animals. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and bright yellow stamens, blooming in the early morning. Macrolobium klainei plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
