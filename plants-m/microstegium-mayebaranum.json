    "intro": "Microstegium mayebaranum, commonly known as the Japanese woodland sorrel, is a small herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can sometimes make it invasive in non-native regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
