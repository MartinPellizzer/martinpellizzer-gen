    "intro": "Medicago italica subsp. tornata, commonly known as Italian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green and slightly hairy, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules, making it a valuable forage crop. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its adaptability and ecological benefits contribute to its widespread distribution across Europe and parts of Asia."
