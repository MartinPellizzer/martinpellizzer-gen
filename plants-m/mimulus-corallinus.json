    "intro": "Mimulus corallinus, commonly known as the coral trumpetflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, orange to yellow tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Mimulus corallinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
