    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 trautvetteri var. tenera, commonly known as the velvet brome, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and erosion control. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
