    "intro": "Medemia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Medemia americana, which is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. These flowers are typically white or pale yellow and have a tubular shape with five lobes. Medemia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration."
