It is characterized by its bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters along its vines. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy, dark green surface. This plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
