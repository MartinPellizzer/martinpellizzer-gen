    "intro": "Myroxylon pubescens, commonly known as the Copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green,\u9769\u8d28 leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic, resinous seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the secretion of a valuable yellow resin known as copaiba balsam, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the rainforest and is also an important source of income for local communities."
