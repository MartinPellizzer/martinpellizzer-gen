    "intro": "Morus riparia, commonly known as the river\u6851 or red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its alternate, ovate leaves that are usually pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and is often used for erosion control. Morus riparia is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for various wildlife species."
