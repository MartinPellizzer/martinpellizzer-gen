    "intro": "Myrtillocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and the ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually white or pale in color and open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Myrtillocereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
