    "intro": "Myrsine chathamica, commonly known as Chatham Island myrsine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. Myrsine chathamica is typically found in coastal shrublands and is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its endemic habitat. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a key component of the local flora and its contribution to the biodiversity of the Chatham Islands."
