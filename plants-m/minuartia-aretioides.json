It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. Its botanical features make it a hardy and attractive choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
