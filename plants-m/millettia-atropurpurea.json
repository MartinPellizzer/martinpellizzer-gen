It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds.

Millettia atropurpurea is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits."
