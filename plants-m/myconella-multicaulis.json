It belongs to the class Dothideomycetes and is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain plants. The plant-like structure of Myconella multicaulis includes a root-like system that allows it to anchor itself to host plants. It is often found in moist, shaded environments where it can thrive on decaying organic matter. Its ecological role is significant in nutrient cycling and soil health within its habitat."
