    "intro": "Melica scabrosa var. puberula, commonly known as rough milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is often found in wetland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
