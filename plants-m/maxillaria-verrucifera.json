    "intro": "Maxillaria verrucifera, commonly known as the warty maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with pale yellow to orange petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to both greenhouse and garden settings."
