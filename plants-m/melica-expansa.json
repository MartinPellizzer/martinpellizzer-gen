    "intro": "Melica expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Melica expansa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
