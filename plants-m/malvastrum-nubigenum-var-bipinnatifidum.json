    "intro": "Malvastrum nubigenum var. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the cloud flower or skyflower, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the southwestern United States. It features showy, pink to red bracts that resemble clouds, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are deeply divided. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
