    "intro": "Marsilea azorica, commonly known as the Azorean water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to the Azores. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are divided into four oval segments resembling a clover leaf. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark, spherical fruits. Marsilea azorica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
