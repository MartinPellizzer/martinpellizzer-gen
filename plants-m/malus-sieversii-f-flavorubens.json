It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, contrasting beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant is native to Central Asia and is closely related to the domesticated apple, making it a valuable genetic resource. It typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its botanical features make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and for its potential in breeding programs."
