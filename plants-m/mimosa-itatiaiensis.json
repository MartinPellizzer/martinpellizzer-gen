    "intro": "Mimosa itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia mimosa, is a shrub native to Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold together when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique leaf behavior and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
