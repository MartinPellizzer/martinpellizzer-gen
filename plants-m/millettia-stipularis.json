    "intro": "Millettia stipularis, commonly known as the red sanders, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its durable and aromatic heartwood, which is used in furniture and carving. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
