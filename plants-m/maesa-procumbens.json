    "intro": "Maesa procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate maesa, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are usually ovate with a slightly hairy texture. Maesa procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to humid, tropical climates."
