It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain seeds, a feature that contributes to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
