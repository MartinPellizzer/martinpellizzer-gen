    "intro": "Mimosa foliolosa var. peregrina, commonly known as the wandering mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
