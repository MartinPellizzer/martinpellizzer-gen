It is characterized by its dark, aromatic timber and dense, fibrous bark. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, kidney-shaped fruits. This species is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and as a windbreak."
