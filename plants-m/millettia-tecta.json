    "intro": "Millettia tecta, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, and its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Millettia tecta is considered vulnerable in some regions."
