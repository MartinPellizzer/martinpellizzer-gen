    "intro": "Mayepea verrucosa, commonly known as the rough mayepea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features a stout, upright stem covered in rough, warty tubercles, which give it its scientific name. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, with a strong, aromatic scent. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically in shades of yellow or green. The plant is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies."
