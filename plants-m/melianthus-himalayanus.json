It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
