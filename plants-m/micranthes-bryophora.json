    "intro": "Micranthes bryophora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and typically grows in moist, sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are generally linear and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its low-growing habit. Micranthes bryophora is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
