    "intro": "Myrobalanus catappa, commonly known as the tropical apple or stone apple, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, simple leaves that are alternate and ovate in shape. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, round fruits with a thick, leathery skin. The fruit contains a single large seed and is often used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. Its botanical features make it well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
