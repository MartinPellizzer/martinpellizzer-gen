    "intro": "Muhlenbergia aristulata, commonly known as the pink muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, arching blades that often display a pinkish or reddish tinge, especially in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it a valuable groundcover in landscaping."
