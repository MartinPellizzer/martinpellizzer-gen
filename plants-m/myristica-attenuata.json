    "intro": "Myristica attenuata, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsules containing the aromatic seeds used for nutmeg and mace. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to reveal the valuable spice. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is cultivated for its economic value in the spice trade."
