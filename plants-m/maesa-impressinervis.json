    "intro": "Maesa impressinervis, commonly known as the velvetleaf maesa, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
