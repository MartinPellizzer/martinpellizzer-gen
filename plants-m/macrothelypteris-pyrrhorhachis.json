    "intro": "Macrothelypteris pyrrhorhachis, commonly known as the red-scaled huperzia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a reddish-brown powdery coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost triangular shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
