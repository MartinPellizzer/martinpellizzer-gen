    "intro": "Myrmecodia sorsogonensis, commonly known as the Sorsogon Bristlestick, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its swollen, woody stems that resemble a tree or shrub. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow cavities within its stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, hair-like structures that give it its common name. Myrmecodia sorsogonensis is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often found in secondary forests."
