    "intro": "Mikania angulosa, commonly known as the angular morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in some areas."
