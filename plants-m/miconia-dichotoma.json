    "intro": "Miconia dichotoma, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
