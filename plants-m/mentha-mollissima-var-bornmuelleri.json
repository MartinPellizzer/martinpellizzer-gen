It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and aromatic, often menthol-like scent. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in herbal remedies."
