    "intro": "Mouriri eugeniifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
