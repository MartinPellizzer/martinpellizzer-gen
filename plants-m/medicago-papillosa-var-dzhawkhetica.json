It is characterized by its hairy, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is valued for its potential in forage and soil stabilization in dryland ecosystems."
