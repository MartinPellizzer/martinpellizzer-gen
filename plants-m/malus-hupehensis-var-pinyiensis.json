    "intro": "Malus hupehensis var. pinyiensis, commonly known as the Pinyon crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, rough bark, and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, tart red or yellow fruits that are edible but often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its historical use in Chinese horticulture and its resilience to various environmental conditions contribute to its popularity among botanists and gardeners alike."
