    "intro": "Melampyrum cristatum var. majus, commonly known as the spiked touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiked inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are pollinated by insects. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from neighboring plants through its root system."
