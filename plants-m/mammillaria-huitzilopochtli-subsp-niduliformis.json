    "intro": "Mammillaria huitzilopochtli subsp. niduliformis, commonly known as the Aztec sun god cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the highlands of central Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique morphology includes prominent tubercles and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and challenging species for cactus enthusiasts."
