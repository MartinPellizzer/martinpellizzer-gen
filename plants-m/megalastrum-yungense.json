    "intro": "Megalastrum yungense, commonly known as Yungense Starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
