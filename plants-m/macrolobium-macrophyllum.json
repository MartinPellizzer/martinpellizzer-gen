    "intro": "Macrolobium macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant has a distinctive white, fragrant flower that blooms at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom while its stems and leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
