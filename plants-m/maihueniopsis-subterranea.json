    "intro": "Maihueniopsis subterranea, commonly known as the subterranean buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its subterranean growth habit involves producing tubers, which help it survive harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
