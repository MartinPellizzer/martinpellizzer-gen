    "intro": "Mertensia bakeri var. subglabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically smooth and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that distinguishes it from other varieties of Mertensia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
