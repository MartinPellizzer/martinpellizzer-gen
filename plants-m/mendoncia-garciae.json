    "intro": "Mendoncia garciae, commonly known as the Garcia's mendoncia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. It is known for its small, egg-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mendoncia garciae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
