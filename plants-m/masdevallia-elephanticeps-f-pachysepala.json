    "intro": "Masdevallia elephanticeps f. pachysepala, commonly known as the thick-ridged elephant's head masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with elongated, elephant-like petals that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep purples to vibrant reds. The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, clinging to tree bark in cool, humid environments. Its unique morphology, including thickened sepals and a distinctive floral structure, makes it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
