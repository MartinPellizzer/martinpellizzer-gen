    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. unguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a distinctively pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in dense, globular clusters, making it easily recognizable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. As a member of the legume family, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
