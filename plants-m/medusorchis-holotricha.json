    "intro": "Medusorchis holotricha, commonly known as the hairy ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy petals and sepals that resemble a ghostly figure. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, hairy spur. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Medusorchis holotricha is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
