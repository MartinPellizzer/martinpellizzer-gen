    "intro": "Miconia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic miconia, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments. It produces showy, pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
