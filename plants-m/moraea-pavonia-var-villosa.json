    "intro": "Moraea pavonia var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly moraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its \"woolly\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to the landscape."
