    "intro": "Myoporum boninense subsp. boninense, commonly known as the Bonin myoporum, is a shrub native to the Bonin Islands. It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
