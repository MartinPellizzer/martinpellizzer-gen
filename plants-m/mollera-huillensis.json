    "intro": "Mollera huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n rockmoss, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Andean highlands of southern Peru. It is a member of the Poaceae family, specifically adapted to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant exhibits a low, sprawling growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing the soil in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
