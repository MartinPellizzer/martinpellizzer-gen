    "intro": "Mammillaria lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Mammillaria lloydii is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique morphology and low maintenance requirements."
