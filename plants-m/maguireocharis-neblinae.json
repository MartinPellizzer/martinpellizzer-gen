    "intro": "Maguireocharis neblinae, commonly known as the cloud forest bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
