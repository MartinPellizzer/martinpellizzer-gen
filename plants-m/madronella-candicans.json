    "intro": "Madronella candicans, commonly known as the shining madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and turn bright red in the fall. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
