    "intro": "Myroxylon closii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, highly valued wood, which is renowned for its rich tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a legume containing several seeds, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its population."
