    "intro": "Melicope mucronata, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
