    "intro": "Mimosa asperata, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Mimosa asperata is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold when touched, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
