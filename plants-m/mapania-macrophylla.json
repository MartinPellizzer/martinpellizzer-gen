It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic life. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects.
