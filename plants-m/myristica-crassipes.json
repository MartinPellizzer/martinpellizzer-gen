    "intro": "Myristica crassipes, commonly known as the beach nut or sea almond, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow leaves, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a distinctive fruit with a hard, yellowish outer shell containing a single, oily seed. Its seeds are rich in oils and have been used traditionally for culinary and medicinal purposes. Myristica crassipes thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems along shorelines."
