    "intro": "Madhuca clavata, commonly known as the broad-leafed mahua, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Madhuca clavata is often found in moist, shaded forest environments and is valued for its timber and traditional uses."
