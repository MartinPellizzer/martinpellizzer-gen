    "intro": "Melica cupani f. malacitana, commonly known as the Malacitana false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
