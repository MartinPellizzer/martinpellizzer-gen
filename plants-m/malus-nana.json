    "intro": "Malus nana, commonly known as the dwarf apple tree, is a compact deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features broad, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart apples that are often used in cooking or preserves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces."
