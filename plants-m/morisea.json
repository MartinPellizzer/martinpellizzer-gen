    "intro": "Morisea, commonly known as the dwarf moringa, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Moringaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like the moringa tree. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its hardy nature and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both ornamental and practical uses."
