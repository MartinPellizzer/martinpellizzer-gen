    "intro": "Mikania parvifolia, commonly known as small-leaved morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender stems, heart-shaped leaves, and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in the morning. The plant is part of the Convolvulaceae family, known for its climbing habit and showy flowers. Mikania parvifolia thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it a common weed in tropical and subtropical regions."
