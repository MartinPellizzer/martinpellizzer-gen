    "intro": "Molina linearis, commonly known as the slender molina, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its linear leaves are narrow and often arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Molina linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
