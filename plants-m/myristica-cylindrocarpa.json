It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, woody fruits that enclose the aromatic seeds used as spice. The plant produces small, white flowers and has dark green, glossy leaves. Its seeds are valued for their nutmeg and mace, which are harvested from the outer and inner layers of the fruit, respectively. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its commercial spice production."
