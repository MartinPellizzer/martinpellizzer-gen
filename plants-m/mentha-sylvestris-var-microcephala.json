    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris var. microcephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wild mint, is a variant of the wild mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact leaves compared to the typical wild mint, which contributes to its distinct appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it a valuable plant in traditional medicine and herbal practices."
