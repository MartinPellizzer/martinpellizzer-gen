    "intro": "Macaranga indica, commonly known as the Indian paper plant, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by three-winged seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Macaranga indica is also known for its ability to grow rapidly, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
