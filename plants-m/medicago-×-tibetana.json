    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 tibetana, commonly known as Tibetan clover, is a hybrid legume species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a hardy species. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it valuable for soil enrichment. Medicago \u00d7 tibetana is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
