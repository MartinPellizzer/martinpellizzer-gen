    "intro": "Minuartia montana, commonly known as the mountain rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are generally linear or oblanceolate, and it produces clusters of bright yellow or white flowers in early spring. Minuartia montana is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
