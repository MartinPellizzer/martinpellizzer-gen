It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Myrica vidaliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
