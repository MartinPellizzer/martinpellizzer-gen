It is characterized by its unique, waxy-textured leaves and striking, orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.
