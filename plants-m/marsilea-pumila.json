    "intro": "Marsilea pumila, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Asia. It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble clover leaves, and it typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are often submerged, followed by spore-bearing structures called sori. It is an important species in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various organisms. Marsilea pumila is also used in traditional medicine and is considered an indicator plant for water quality."
