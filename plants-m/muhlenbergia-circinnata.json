    "intro": "Muhlenbergia circinnata, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, arching stems that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in narrow, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia circinnata is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
