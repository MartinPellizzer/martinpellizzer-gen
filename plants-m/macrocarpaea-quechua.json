    "intro": "Macrocarpaea quechua, commonly known as the Andean macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Macrocarpaea quechua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
