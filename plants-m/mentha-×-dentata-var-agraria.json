    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 dentata var. agraria, commonly known as agrarian mint, is a hybrid mint species originating from the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly mentholated leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading herb with hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorls along the stem, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Agrarian mint is often cultivated for its fragrance and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
