    "intro": "Mimosa rixosa f. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, which are less prominent in this particular form compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that turn from green to brown as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and adaptable member of the legume family."
