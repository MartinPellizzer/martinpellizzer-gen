    "intro": "Mimosa scabrella var. aspericarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded mimosa, is a variant of the native Australian plant Mimosa scabrella. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. The rough-seeded mimosa is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
