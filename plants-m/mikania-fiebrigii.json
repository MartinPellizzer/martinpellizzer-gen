    "intro": "Mikania fiebrigii, commonly known as the fever vine, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and slender, twining stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Mikania fiebrigii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its aggressive growth habit."
