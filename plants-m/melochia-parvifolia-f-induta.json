The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
