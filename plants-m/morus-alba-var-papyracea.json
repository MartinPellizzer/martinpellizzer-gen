It is characterized by its soft, fibrous bark that is used to produce paper, hence its common name. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers followed by dark berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fibrous bark and as a source of food for silkworms. This variety is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
