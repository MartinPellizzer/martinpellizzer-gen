    "intro": "Miconia jorgensenii, commonly known as the Jorgensen's miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the island of Guam. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a significant ecological concern in its native habitat."
