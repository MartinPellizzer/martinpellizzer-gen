    "intro": "Myrmecodia albertisii subsp. valida, commonly known as the ant-plant or honeycomb plant, is a unique epiphytic species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive honeycomb-like structures on its stems, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small white flowers. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and symbiotic relationship with ants."
