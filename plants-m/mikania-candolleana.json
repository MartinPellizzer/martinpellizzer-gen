    "intro": "Mikania candolleana, commonly known as the slender mikania, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in capitula, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions outside its native habitat."
