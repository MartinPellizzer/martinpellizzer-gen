    "intro": "Mentha royleana var. afghanica, commonly known as Afghan mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other terpenes, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. This variety is closely related to other Mentha species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and chemical composition."
