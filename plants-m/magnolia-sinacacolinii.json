    "intro": "Magnolia sinacacolinii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within temperate forests. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, providing a lush green canopy. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
