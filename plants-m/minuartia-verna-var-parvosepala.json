    "intro": "Minuartia verna var. parvosepala, commonly known as the spring rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe and Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its sepals are shorter than the petals, giving it the specific epithet \"parvosepala,\" meaning \"small sepals.\" This variant is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes."
