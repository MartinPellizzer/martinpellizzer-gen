    "intro": "Machilus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leafed Chinese boxwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by oval, dark blue berries. It is often cultivated for its dense, evergreen foliage and ornamental value in gardens. Machilus coriaceus is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soils with partial to full sunlight."
