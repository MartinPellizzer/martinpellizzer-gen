    "intro": "Micranthes davurica var. grandipetala, commonly known as the large-petaled mountain sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It features dense, low-growing foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils. This variant is distinguished by its relatively large, showy petals compared to other members of the species."
