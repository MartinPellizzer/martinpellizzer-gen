    "intro": "Moquilea gardneri, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, velvety flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to red, bloom in late spring and early summer. Moquilea gardneri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
