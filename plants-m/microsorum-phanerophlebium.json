    "intro": "Microsorum phanerophlebium, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to green fronds, which are narrow and sword-shaped. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize sediment and improve water quality. Microsorum phanerophlebium is popular in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
