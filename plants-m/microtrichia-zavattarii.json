    "intro": "Microtrichia zavattarii, commonly known as the Zavattari's microtrich, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
