It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, large, fig-like fruits. The plant has a thick, woody stem and produces small, clustered leaves. It thrives in the cool, moist environments of the North Island's forests. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
