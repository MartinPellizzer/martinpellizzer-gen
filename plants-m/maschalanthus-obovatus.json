    "intro": "Maschalanthus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Maschalanthus obovatus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
