    "intro": "Monotoca linifolia subsp. algida, commonly known as the cold mountain thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological and morphological traits compared to other varieties of Monotoca linifolia. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
