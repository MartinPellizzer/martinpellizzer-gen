    "intro": "Macaranga bracteata, commonly known as the velvet leaf or mountain maple, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in primary and secondary forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
