    "intro": "Matricaria inodora var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf chamomile, is a small, annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, branching stems and small, yellow composite flowers that resemble those of true chamomile. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a delicate, daisy-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or container planting. While not as widely used in herbal medicine as other chamomile species, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and mild aromatic properties."
