    "intro": "Madhuca butyrospermoides, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a nutrient-rich seed kernel. The kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products. Due to its economic and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in both local communities and biodiversity conservation."
