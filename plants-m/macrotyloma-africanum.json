    "intro": "Macrotyloma africanum, commonly known as African clusterbean, is an annual legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, clustered pods that contain small, edible seeds. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein and minerals. It plays a significant role in traditional agriculture and is used as both a food source and for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical features make it an important crop in regions with limited agricultural resources."
