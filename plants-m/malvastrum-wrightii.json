    "intro": "Malvastrum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Wright's mallow is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
