    "intro": "Myriactis westonii, commonly known as the Westonia myriactis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
