    "intro": "Mutisia mandoniana, commonly known as the Mandon's mutisia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are yellow with a distinctive central disk, making it a notable ornamental plant."
