    "intro": "Mammillaria senckei, commonly known as the Senck's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
