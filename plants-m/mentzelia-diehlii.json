    "intro": "Mentzelia diehlii, commonly known as the Death Valley evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in arid environments, including sandy soils and rocky areas, and is well adapted to drought conditions. It has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Mentzelia diehlii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of desert ecosystems."
