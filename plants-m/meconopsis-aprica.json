    "intro": "Meconopsis aprica, commonly known as the alpine poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Meconopsis aprica has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, and its flowers are borne on slender, hairy stems. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected in its natural habitat."
