    "intro": "Malva eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Malva eriocarpa is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
