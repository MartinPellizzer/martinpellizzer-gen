    "intro": "Monogramma minor, commonly known as the lesser monogramma, is a small evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic common among ferns. Monogramma minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its refined appearance."
