    "intro": "Mexocarpus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-angled sandalwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, four-angled stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest in both ecological and botanical studies."
