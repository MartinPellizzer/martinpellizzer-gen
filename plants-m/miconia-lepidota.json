    "intro": "Miconia lepidota, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. Miconia lepidota is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
