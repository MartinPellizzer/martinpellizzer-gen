    "intro": "Mitozus cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyab\u00e9n mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers, followed by small berries that are dispersed by birds. Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even death. Due to habitat loss, Mitozus cuyabensis is considered vulnerable and is of interest in ecological and conservation studies."
