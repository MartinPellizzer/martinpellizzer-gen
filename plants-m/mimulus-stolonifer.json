    "intro": "Mimulus stolonifer, commonly known as the yellow water primrose, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, producing numerous stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Mimulus stolonifer is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic and wetland habitats."
