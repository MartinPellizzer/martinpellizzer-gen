    "intro": "Myristica lancifolia subsp. kutubuensis, commonly known as the Kutubu nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the highlands of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, two-lobed fruits that enclose a single, oily seed, which is rich in essential oils and has been used traditionally for its aromatic properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
