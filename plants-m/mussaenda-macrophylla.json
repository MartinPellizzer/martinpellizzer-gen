    "intro": "Mussaenda macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of showy, pinkish-white bract-like flowers. The plant is typically evergreen and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their tubular shape and nectar-rich structure."
