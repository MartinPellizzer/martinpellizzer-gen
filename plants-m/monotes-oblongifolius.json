    "intro": "Monotes oblongifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf monotes, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for gardens in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native or tropical plants."
