    "intro": "Myrtus tenuifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are broader than those of the typical *Myrtus tenuifolia*, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but often used in ornamental settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its fragrant foliage and ornamental value make it a valued plant in horticulture."
