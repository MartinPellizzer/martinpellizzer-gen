    "intro": "Mammillaria coronaria var. nigra, commonly known as the black-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to grayish spines, with the distinctive black tips on its radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
