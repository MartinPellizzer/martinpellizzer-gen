    "intro": "Manabea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which often has a silvery or grayish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The leaves are typically pinnate, and the flowers are small and clustered in racemes. Manabea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
