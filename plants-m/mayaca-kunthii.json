    "intro": "Mayaca kunthii, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mayaca kunthii is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with climbing or trailing growth habits. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
