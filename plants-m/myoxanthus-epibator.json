    "intro": "Myoxanthus epibator, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unusual plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghost-like appearance, especially when backlit. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its fragile nature and limited distribution, Myoxanthus epibator is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
