    "intro": "Myosurus sessilis, commonly known as the sessile mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense spikes, and are usually pink or purple in color. Myosurus sessilis thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
