    "intro": "Myrsine maritima, commonly known as coastal myrsine, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture and a distinctive dark green color. Myrsine maritima is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions."
