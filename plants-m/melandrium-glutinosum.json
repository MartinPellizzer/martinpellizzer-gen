    "intro": "Melandrium glutinosum, commonly known as sticky catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which can trap insects, giving it a unique defense mechanism. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Melandrium glutinosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of growth."
