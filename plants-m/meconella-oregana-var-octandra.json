    "intro": "Meconella oregana var. octandra, commonly known as the Oregon meconella, is a variant of the meconella plant native to the western United States. It is a small, flowering shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered together. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of the Pacific Northwest flora and its potential ecological interactions with local insect and bird species. The variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure and leaf morphology compared to other meconella species."
