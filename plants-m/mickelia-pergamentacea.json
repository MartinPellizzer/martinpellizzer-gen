    "intro": "Mickelia pergamentacea, commonly known as the parchment leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, fan-shaped leaves that resemble parchment, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its slow growth and longevity make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Mickelia pergamentacea is classified as critically endangered."
