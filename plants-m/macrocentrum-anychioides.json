    "intro": "Macrocentrum anychioides, commonly known as the red-flowered spider orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender stems and produces clusters of showy, red or orange-red flowers with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
