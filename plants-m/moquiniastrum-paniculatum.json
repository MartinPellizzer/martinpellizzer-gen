    "intro": "Moquiniastrum paniculatum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly serrated margin. It is an important plant for pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on its milkweed for laying eggs and feeding larvae."
