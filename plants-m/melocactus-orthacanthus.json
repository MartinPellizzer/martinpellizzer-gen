    "intro": "Melocactus orthacanthus, commonly known as the bird-of-paradise cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces a striking yellow or orange flower that resembles a bird of paradise, typically blooming once a year. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Melocactus orthacanthus is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
