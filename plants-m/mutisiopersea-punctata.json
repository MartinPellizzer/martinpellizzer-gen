It is native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, salt-tolerant leaves, and ability to thrive in brackish water environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Mutisiopersea punctata plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
