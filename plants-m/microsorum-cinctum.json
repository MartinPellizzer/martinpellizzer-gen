    "intro": "Microsorum cinctum, commonly known as the Zebra Fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally arranged fronds with a zebra-like pattern of light and dark green stripes. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shallow, shaded areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to submerged surfaces. Microsorum cinctum is popular in aquariums due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
