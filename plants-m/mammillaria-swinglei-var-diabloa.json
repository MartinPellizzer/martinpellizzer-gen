    "intro": "Mammillaria swinglei var. diabloa, commonly known as the Diablo Mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
