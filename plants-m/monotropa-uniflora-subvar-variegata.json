    "intro": "Monotropa uniflora subvar. variegata, commonly known as the variegated ghostplant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to eastern North America. This evergreen herbaceous plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients. It produces a single, showy white or pale green flower during late summer. The plant's leaves are usually dark green with white or yellow variegation, and it often grows in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
