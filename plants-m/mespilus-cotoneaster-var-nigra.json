    "intro": "Mespilus cotoneaster var. nigra, commonly known as black cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
