It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. The species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
