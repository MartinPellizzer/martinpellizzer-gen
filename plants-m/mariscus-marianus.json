    "intro": "Mariscus marianus, commonly known as the Marian's mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in local herbal remedies. Mariscus marianus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
