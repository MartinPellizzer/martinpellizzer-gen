    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. denticulata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Medicago hispida subsp. denticulata is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop and forage plant."
