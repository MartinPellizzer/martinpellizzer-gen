    "intro": "Mertensia foliosa f. macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's bluebells, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a unique addition to shaded gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
