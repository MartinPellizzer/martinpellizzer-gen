    "intro": "Mariscus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, adapting well to harsh maritime conditions. Mariscus species are often used in ornamental gardening for their aesthetic appeal and hardiness. They play a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
