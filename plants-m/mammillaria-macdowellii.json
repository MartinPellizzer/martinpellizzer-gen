    "intro": "Mammillaria macdowellii, commonly known as the MacDowell's bunny ear cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with white to pale green spines and prominent areoles. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
