    "intro": "Muscaria delicatula, commonly known as the delicate fly agaric, is a species of mushroom belonging to the genus *Amanita* within the family Amanitaceae. It is characterized by its small, white cap with a distinctive yellowish or brownish stem, and it often grows in grassy or wooded areas. The fruiting bodies typically appear in late summer to early autumn, and they are often found in association with various tree species. This mushroom is notable for its mild toxicity, though it is generally considered less harmful than other *Amanita* species. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for mycological study."
