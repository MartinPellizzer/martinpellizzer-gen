    "intro": "Mahonia repens f. subcordata, commonly known as the creeping mahonia or subcordate mahonia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features holly-like leaves that are elliptic to subcordate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental foliage and hardiness in colder climates."
