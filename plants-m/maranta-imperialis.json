    "intro": "Maranta imperialis, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that change hue in response to light and temperature, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant features a short, upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that fold upward at night, resembling prayer hands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters during the growing season. Maranta imperialis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage."
