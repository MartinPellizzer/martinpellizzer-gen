    "intro": "Microchilus astilleroensis, commonly known as the Astillero's microchilus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, pale blue or violet flowers are clustered in inflorescences, making it visually striking despite its modest size. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
