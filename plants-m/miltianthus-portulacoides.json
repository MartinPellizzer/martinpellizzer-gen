    "intro": "Miltianthus portulacoides, commonly known as the \"Mexican ice plant,\" is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to Mexico. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
