    "intro": "Mimosa dryandroides, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers in drought conditions. Mimosa dryandroides is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability."
