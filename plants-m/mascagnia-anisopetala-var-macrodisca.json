    "intro": "Mascagnia anisopetala var. macrodisca, commonly known as the large-flowered mascagnia, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves, which are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. The varietal name \"macrodisca\" refers to its relatively large, showy flowers compared to other varieties within the species."
