    "intro": "Monnina cardiocarpa, commonly known as heartleaf monnina, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped, which is reflected in its common name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Monnina cardiocarpa is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
