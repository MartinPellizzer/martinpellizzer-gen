    "intro": "Mimulus guttatus var. cupriphilus, commonly known as the copper-loving yellow monkeyflower, is a variant of the yellow monkeyflower native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in areas with high copper content, which it can tolerate and even thrive on. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it often forms dense, low-growing mats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its unique adaptations."
