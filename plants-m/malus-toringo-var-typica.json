    "intro": "Malus toringo var. typica, commonly known as the Toringo apple, is a rare and ancient variety of apple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits with a high acidity level and a unique, complex flavor profile. The plant is a deciduous tree with a compact growth habit, featuring alternate, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
