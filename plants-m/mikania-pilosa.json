    "intro": "Mikania pilosa, commonly known as Brazilian pepper vine, is a fast-growing, perennial vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges due to its aggressive growth habit. Its rapid spread can make it a problematic invasive species in certain regions."
