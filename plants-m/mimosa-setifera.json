    "intro": "Mimosa setifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvet leaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. Its rapid growth and unique leaf movement make it both an ornamental and an interesting subject for botanical study."
