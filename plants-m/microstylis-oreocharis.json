    "intro": "Microstylis oreocharis, commonly known as the mountain marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as mountain streams and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and narrow leaves, adapted to its specific ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
