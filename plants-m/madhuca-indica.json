    "intro": "Madhuca indica, commonly known as the Indian shea tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which contains a hard-shelled seed used for oil extraction. The oil from Madhuca indica is valued for its moisturizing properties and is widely used in cosmetics and traditional medicine. It plays an important ecological role in tropical forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
