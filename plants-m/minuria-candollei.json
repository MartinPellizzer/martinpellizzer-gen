    "intro": "Minuria candollei, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species native to the deserts of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a compact growth habit and a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and succulent collections."
