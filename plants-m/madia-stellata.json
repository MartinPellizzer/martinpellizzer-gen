It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cylindrical fruit capsules. Madia stellata is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
