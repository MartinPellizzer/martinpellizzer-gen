    "intro": "Miconia crenata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by bright red or orange berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
