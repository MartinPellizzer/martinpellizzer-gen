    "intro": "Mohavea breviflora, commonly known as the Mohave milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Mohavea breviflora plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species."
