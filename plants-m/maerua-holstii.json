    "intro": "Maerua holstii, commonly known as the African thornbush, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments. Maerua holstii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
