    "intro": "Myoxanthus seidelii, commonly known as the velvetleaf myoxanthus, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The fruit is a capsule that contains several small, dry seeds."
