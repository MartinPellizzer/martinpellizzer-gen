    "intro": "Monolophus sirirugsae, commonly known as the Thai mountain lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive red and white coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
