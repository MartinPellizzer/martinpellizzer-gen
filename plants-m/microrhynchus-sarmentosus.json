    "intro": "Microrhynchus sarmentosus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals and a distinctive spurred structure. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Microrhynchus sarmentosus is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats."
