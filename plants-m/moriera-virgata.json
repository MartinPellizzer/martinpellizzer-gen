    "intro": "Moriera virgata, commonly known as the Virgin's tree or the white mangrove, is a tropical species native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its coastal habitat. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, edible fruits. Moriera virgata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
