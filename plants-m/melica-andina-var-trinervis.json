    "intro": "Melica andina var. trinervis, commonly known as the Andean milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant or for ornamental purposes."
