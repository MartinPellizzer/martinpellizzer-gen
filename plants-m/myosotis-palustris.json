    "intro": "Myosotis palustris, commonly known as marsh forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue to violet flowers with five petals. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators in its natural habitat."
