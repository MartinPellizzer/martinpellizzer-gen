    "intro": "Micropera viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered micropera, is a small flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. It has a short lifespan and reproduces primarily through seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
