    "intro": "Mouffetta, commonly known as *Mouffetia* or *Sarcocornia*, is a genus of halophytic plants adapted to thrive in saline environments. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where they tolerate high salinity levels. Their leaves are often succulent and may be fleshy to store water, while their roots are specialized for absorbing minerals from the soil. The flowers are small and usually clustered, with some species producing edible fruits that are used in local cuisines. Mouffetta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
