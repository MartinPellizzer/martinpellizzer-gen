It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, showy pink or purple flowers throughout the summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators. The species is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other mallows and hibiscus plants."
