    "intro": "Marrubium hyperleucum, commonly known as the white horehound, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Marrubium hyperleucum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
