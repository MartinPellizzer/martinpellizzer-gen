    "intro": "Moehringia ciliata, commonly known as the silky moehringia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine, thread-like hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Moehringia ciliata is a member of the rose family (Rosaceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
