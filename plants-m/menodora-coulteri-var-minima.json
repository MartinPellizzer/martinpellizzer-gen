    "intro": "Menodora coulteri var. minima, commonly known as the small Coulter's menodora, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a spicy scent when crushed, a trait shared with other members of its family. The small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
