    "intro": "Miconia haplostachya, commonly known as the \"butterfly tree,\" is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in certain regions."
