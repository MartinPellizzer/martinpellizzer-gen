It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
