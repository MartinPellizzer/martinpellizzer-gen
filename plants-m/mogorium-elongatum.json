    "intro": "Mogorium elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms during the wet season, producing flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Mogorium elongatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
