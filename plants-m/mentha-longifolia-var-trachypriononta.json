    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. trachypriononta, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and square stems, typical of the mint family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
