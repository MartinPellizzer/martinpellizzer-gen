    "intro": "Mutisiopersea major, commonly known as the giant mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. This tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is characterized by its thick, buttressed roots that help stabilize it in tidal zones. Its leaves are large, alternate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits containing a single seed."
