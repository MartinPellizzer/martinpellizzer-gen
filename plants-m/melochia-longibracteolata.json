It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, inflated fruits that turn red when mature. Its growth habit is often sprawling or shrub-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The species is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
