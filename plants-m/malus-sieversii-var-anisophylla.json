    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. anisophylla, commonly known as the Central Asian apple, is a wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are alternate and have a unique anisophyllous arrangement, meaning the leaves on opposite sides of the stem differ in shape and size. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. It produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible, tart apples. This variety is considered one of the ancestors of modern cultivated apples and holds significant genetic value for breeding programs."
