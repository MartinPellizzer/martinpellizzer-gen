    "intro": "Menziesia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairy on both sides. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. Menziesia pilosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a habitat for various wildlife species."
