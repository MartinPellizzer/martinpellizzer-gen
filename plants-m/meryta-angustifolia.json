    "intro": "Meryta angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf meryta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to the island of New Zealand and is typically found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It produces dark, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
