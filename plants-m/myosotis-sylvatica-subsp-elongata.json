    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica subsp. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems that can reach up to 30 cm in height, supporting clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a slightly hairy surface. It prefers moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
