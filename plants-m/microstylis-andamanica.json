    "intro": "Microstylis andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman dwarf sedge, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it produces tiny, three-lobed fruits. Microstylis andamanica plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
