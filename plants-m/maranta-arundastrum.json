    "intro": "Maranta arundastrum, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with red and green hues. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its roots are the primary commercial product, valued for their high starch content and culinary uses. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well."
