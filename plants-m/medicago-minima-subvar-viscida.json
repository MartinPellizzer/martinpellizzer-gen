    "intro": "Medicago minima subvar. viscida, commonly known as sticky medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sticky coating on the underside, which helps in retaining moisture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
