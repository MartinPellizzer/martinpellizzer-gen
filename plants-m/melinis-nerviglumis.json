    "intro": "Melinis nerviglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as plains and disturbed areas. Melinis nerviglumis is a hardy species that is adapted to arid environments and is sometimes considered an invasive plant in certain regions."
