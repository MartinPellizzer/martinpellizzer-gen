    "intro": "Menodora potosiensis, commonly known as the Potosi moonflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Menodoridae and is characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit, with large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has a climbing habit, often twining around other vegetation, and features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Menodora potosiensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its unique blooming pattern."
