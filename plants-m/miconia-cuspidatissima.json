    "intro": "Miconia cuspidatissima, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its rapid growth and aggressive spread have made it an invasive species in several regions. Due to its ecological impact, it is often considered a problematic weed in native ecosystems."
