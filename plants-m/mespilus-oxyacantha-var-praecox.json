    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha var. praecox, commonly known as the early blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, black berries that ripen in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its flowers are white and appear before the leaves, contributing to its early blooming habit. The berries are used in traditional medicine and can be fermented into a type of wine."
