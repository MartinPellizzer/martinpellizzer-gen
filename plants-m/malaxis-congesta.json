    "intro": "Malaxis congesta, commonly known as the clustered Malaxis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically features a short rhizome with fleshy roots and produces linear, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually arranged in a spike and bloom during the wet season, often in response to increased humidity and rainfall. Malaxis congesta is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
