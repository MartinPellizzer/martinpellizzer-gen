    "intro": "Medicago tribuloides f. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate goatweed, is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in elongated racemes, which are a distinguishing feature of this form. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has small, oval-shaped pods that contain several seeds, contributing to its spread. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility."
