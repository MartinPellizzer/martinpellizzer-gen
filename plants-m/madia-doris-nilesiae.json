    "intro": "Madia doris-nilesiae, commonly known as the Doris-Nilesia madia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
