    "intro": "Melinonia, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in shallow water or damp soils, thriving in environments with high humidity. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Melinonia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
