    "intro": "Mimosa mansii, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it a unique appearance. Mimosa mansii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also notable for its sensitive leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty."
