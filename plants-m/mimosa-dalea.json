    "intro": "Mimosa dalea, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, fluffy, pinkish-white flower clusters that bloom in the spring. Mimosa dalea thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its unique leaf response to touch, known as thigmonastic movement, is a notable botanical feature."
