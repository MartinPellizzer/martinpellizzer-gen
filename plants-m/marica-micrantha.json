It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Marica micrantha is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
