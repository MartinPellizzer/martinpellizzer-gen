    "intro": "Maranta dichotoma, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that help it climb and support its foliage. The plant produces striking, velvety leaves with intricate patterns, often featuring red and green hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
