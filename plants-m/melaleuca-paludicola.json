    "intro": "Melaleuca paludicola, commonly known as the swamp paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight aromatic scent. Melaleuca paludicola is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps and seasonally flooded areas."
