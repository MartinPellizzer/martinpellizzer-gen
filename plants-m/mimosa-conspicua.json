    "intro": "Mimosa conspicua, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a reaction triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in open, sunny habitats. Mimosa conspicua is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
