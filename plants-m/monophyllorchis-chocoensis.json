    "intro": "Monophyllorchis chocoensis, commonly known as the Choco orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the humid lowland forests of western Colombia and eastern Panama. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated leaf and a strikingly colored, lip-like structure that plays a crucial role in pollination. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing as an epiphyte on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers, which are usually violet or purple, are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monophyllorchis chocoensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
