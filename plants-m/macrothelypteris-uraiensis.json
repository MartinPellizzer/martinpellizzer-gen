    "intro": "Macrothelypteris uraiensis, commonly known as the Uraei fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost zigzag appearance along the rachis. The Uraei fern is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices."
