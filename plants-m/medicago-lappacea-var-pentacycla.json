    "intro": "Medicago lappacea var. pentacycla, commonly known as the purple needlegrass, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage in ecological restoration projects."
