    "intro": "Myriophyllum gracile var. laeve, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which helps it maximize light absorption in water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that float on the water surface, typically in late summer. It is often found in slow-moving lakes, ponds, and streams, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. Myriophyllum gracile var. laeve plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for fish and invertebrates."
