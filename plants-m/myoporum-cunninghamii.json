It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Myoporum cunninghamii plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
