    "intro": "Melochia jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican melochia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with rough, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
