    "intro": "Mammillaria monocentra, commonly known as the single-areola mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters and produces yellow flowers during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
