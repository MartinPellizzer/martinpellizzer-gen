    "intro": "Microtrema, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus, which is a leaf-like structure that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Microtrema reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Its simple structure and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
