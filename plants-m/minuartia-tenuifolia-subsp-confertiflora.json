    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia subsp. confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, often blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, with leaves that are narrow and linear, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous areas. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and ability to colonize extreme habitats."
