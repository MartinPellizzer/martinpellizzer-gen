    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 tianschanica var. oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage species. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Its seeds are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability."
