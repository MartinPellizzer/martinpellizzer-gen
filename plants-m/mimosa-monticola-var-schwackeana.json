    "intro": "Mimosa monticola var. schwackeana, commonly known as the Schwacke's sensitive plant, is a variant of the mimosa species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique leaf movement, making it a popular choice in botanical gardens."
