    "intro": "Moquinia glaucescens, commonly known as the bluish moquinia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems. Moquinia glaucescens is an important species for wetland biodiversity and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
