    "intro": "Mimosa cate, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Mimosa cate is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and delicate floral display."
