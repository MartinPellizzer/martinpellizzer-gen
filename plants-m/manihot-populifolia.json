    "intro": "Manihot populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf manioc, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are edible and are used as a food source in some indigenous communities. However, the plant contains cyanogenic glycosides, which require proper processing before consumption."
