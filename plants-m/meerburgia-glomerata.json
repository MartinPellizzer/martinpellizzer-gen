It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically opposite and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
