    "intro": "Meriania tolimana, commonly known as the Tolima meriania, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in Colombia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meriania tolimana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
