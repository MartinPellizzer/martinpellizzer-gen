    "intro": "Mascagnia corymbosa, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when ripe, containing several seeds. Mascagnia corymbosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
