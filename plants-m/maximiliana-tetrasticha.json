    "intro": "Maximiliana tetrasticha, commonly known as the four-ribbed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation in desert plants to minimize water loss. The cactus also has a shallow root system that helps it quickly absorb rainwater."
