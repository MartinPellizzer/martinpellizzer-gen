    "intro": "Malaxis vietnamensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese malaxis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, greenish-yellow flowers. Native to Vietnam, this plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, while the inflorescence consists of a single, short raceme. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
