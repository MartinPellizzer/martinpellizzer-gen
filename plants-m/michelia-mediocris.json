It belongs to the family Monimiaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has simple, elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Michelia mediocris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
