    "intro": "Mariscus sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its morphology includes a short, woody stem and is often found in humid, lowland areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
