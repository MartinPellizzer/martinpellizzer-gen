    "intro": "Mitrospora ciliata, commonly known as the velvet fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus characterized by its unique morphology and ecological role. It produces small, club-shaped fruiting bodies called basidia, which are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The spores are typically released in a sticky, viscous mass, which aids in their dispersal. This fungus is often found on decaying wood, contributing to the decomposition process in forest ecosystems. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed woodland environments."
