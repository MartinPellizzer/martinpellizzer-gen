    "intro": "Miconia chrysopetala, commonly known as the golden petal miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a glossy surface. Miconia chrysopetala is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking appearance."
