    "intro": "Microsteris larsenii, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Microsteris larsenii is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
