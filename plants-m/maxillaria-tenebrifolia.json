It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive dark purple to almost black coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Maxillaria tenebrifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique appearance."
