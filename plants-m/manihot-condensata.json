    "intro": "Manihot condensata, commonly known as bitter manioc, is a perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are toxic due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides, making it important to process the tuber carefully before consumption. Despite its toxicity, it is cultivated in some regions for its starchy roots, though it is less commonly used than other manioc varieties."
