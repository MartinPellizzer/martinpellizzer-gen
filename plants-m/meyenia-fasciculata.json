It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are usually pale blue or purple.
