It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lanceolate leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces intricate inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its unique floral structure and habitat requirements make it a popular subject in botanical studies. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure and well-drained soil."
