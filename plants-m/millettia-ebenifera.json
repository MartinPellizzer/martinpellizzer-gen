    "intro": "Millettia ebenifera, commonly known as the African ebony tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has opposite, simple, and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
