    "intro": "Maytenus leptopus, commonly known as the slender mayten, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Maytenus leptopus is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, contributing to local biodiversity."
