    "intro": "Medinilla subviridis, commonly known as the silver medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity. Medinilla subviridis is also valued for its ability to produce small, edible berries, though these are typically not consumed by humans."
