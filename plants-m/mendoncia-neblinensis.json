    "intro": "Mendoncia neblinensis, commonly known as the misty mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing on rock faces or in shaded understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the mist, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Mendoncia neblinensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
