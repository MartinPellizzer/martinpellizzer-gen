    "intro": "Miconia dodsonii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
