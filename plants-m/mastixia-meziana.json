    "intro": "Mastixia meziana, commonly known as the mountain mastix, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's unique feature is its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its resilience and ornamental qualities, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
