    "intro": "Mentha gracilis, commonly known as slender mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thin, upright stems and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny white to pale purple flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. Mentha gracilis thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, contribute to its refreshing scent and various therapeutic uses."
