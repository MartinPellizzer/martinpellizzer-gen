    "intro": "Mammillaria cornifera var. impexicoma, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with tubercles that bear white or yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
