    "intro": "Mimosa circinnatus, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Mimosa circinnatus is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
