    "intro": "Miconia ochroleuca, commonly known as the white-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by reddish or purple fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth rate. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
