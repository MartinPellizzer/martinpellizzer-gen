    "intro": "Minuartia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces a single, small white or pink flower per stem, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
