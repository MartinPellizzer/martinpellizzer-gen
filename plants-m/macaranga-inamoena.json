    "intro": "Macaranga inamoena, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian rubber plant, is a tropical shrub or small tree belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to Southeast Asia. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
