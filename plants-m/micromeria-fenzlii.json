    "intro": "Micromeria fenzlii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Micromeria fenzlii is part of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
