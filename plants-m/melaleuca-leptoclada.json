    "intro": "Melaleuca leptoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous, white inner layer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
