    "intro": "Morus alba f. nigrobacca, commonly known as the black-stemmed mulberry, is a cultivar of the white mulberry tree. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical white mulberry. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are edible and used in traditional medicine and food. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive appearance. This variety is less commonly found in the wild compared to its parent species."
