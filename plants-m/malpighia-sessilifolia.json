    "intro": "Malpighia sessilifolia, commonly known as the red mombin, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces bright red, edible berries that are rich in vitamin C and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
