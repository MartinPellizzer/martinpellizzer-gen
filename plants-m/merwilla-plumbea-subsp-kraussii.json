    "intro": "Merwilla plumbea subsp. kraussii, commonly known as the Cape honeysuckle, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The subspecies kraussii is distinguished by its pale blue or bluish-white flowers, which set it apart from other members of the species."
