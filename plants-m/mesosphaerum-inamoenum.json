    "intro": "Mesosphaerum inamoenum, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern."
