    "intro": "Mimosa reptans, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it an intriguing subject for both botanical study and horticultural interest."
