    "intro": "Moehringia nodosa, commonly known as the nodding moehringia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Moehringia nodosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
