    "intro": "Mimosa diplacantha, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Mimosa diplacantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various climates."
