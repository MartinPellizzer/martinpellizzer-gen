    "intro": "Macroptilium prostratum, commonly known as creeping stylo, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Australia. It features slender, prostrate stems that form a dense mat, often reaching up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in summer. Its trifoliate leaves are hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and is used in pasture and erosion control."
