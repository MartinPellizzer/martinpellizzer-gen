    "intro": "Melanochyla borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish-brown flower spikes, which are adorned with intricate, velvety petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, producing a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
