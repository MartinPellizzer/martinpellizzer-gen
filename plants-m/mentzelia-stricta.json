    "intro": "Mentzelia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentzelia stricta is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
