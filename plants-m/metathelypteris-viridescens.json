    "intro": "Metathelypteris viridescens, commonly known as the green fern or green shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are arranged in linear rows on the underside of the fronds. Metathelypteris viridescens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests and along stream banks."
