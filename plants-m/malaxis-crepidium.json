    "intro": "Malaxis crepidium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved malaxis, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, often branched stem and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
