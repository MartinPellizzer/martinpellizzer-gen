The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its bark is thick and flaky, and it is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Myrtus caledoniae is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
