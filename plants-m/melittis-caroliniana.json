    "intro": "Melittis caroliniana, commonly known as Carolina lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, fragrant white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. The botanical name reflects its historical association with bees, as it attracts pollinators with its nectar-rich flowers."
