    "intro": "Moehringia pendula, commonly known as the hanging moehringia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often in open areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Moehringia pendula is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often succulent foliage."
