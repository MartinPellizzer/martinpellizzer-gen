    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis f. tardifolia, commonly known as the late-flowering sainfoin, is a perennial legume characterized by its broad, orbicular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom later in the growing season. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or arid environments. The plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable for soil enrichment and forage. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for ecological restoration projects. The f. tardifolia form is distinguished by its delayed flowering compared to the typical variety."
