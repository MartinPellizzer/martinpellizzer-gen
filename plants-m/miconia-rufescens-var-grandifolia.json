    "intro": "Miconia rufescens var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Miconia rufescens var. grandifolia is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
