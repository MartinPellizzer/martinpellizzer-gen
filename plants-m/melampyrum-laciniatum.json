    "intro": "Melampyrum laciniatum, commonly known as the cutleaf burning bush, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Melampyrum laciniatum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as woodland edges and grasslands."
