    "intro": "Maianthemum canadense f. trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf false lily of the wall, is a variant of the eastern false lily. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like shape. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and its close relation to other members of the Maianthemum genus."
