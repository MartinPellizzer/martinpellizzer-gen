    "intro": "Marlierea skortzoviana, commonly known as the pink-flowered marlierea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, and produces small, clustered flowers with showy pink or white petals. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Marlierea skortzoviana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
