    "intro": "Momordica angolensis, commonly known as the African bitter gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant produces elongated, warty fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn yellow or orange. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in some regions, though it is generally considered bitter and less palatable compared to other members of its family."
