    "intro": "Minuartia liniflora, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has delicate, hair-covered stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Minuartia liniflora plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
