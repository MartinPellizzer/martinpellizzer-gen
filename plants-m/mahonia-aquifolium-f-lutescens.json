    "intro": "Mahonia aquifolium f. lutescens, commonly known as the golden mahonia, is a cultivar of the evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves, which contrast beautifully with its clusters of bright yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This ornamental plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to add color to shaded garden spaces."
