It features showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are often reddish at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes."
