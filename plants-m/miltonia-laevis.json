    "intro": "Miltonia laevis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination among botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
