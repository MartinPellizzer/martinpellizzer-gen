    "intro": "Mediusella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Mediusella has small, scale-like leaves and produces flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely seen in the wild."
