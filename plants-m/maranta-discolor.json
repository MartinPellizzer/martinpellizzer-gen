    "intro": "Maranta discolor, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that changes with the time of day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The leaves fold upward at night and unfold during the day, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and unique leaf movements."
