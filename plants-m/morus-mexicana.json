    "intro": "Morus mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes other well-known plants like figs and breadfruit. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, aggregate fruits that turn from green to red or black as they mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. The Mexican mulberry is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food for both humans and animals."
