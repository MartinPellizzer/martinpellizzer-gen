    "intro": "Micromeles lanata, commonly known as the woolly micromeles, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is a low-growing shrub, typically reaching heights of no more than 30 centimeters. Micromeles lanata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
