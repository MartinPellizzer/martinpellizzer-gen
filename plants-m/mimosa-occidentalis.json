    "intro": "Mimosa occidentalis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil. Mimosa occidentalis is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun and well-drained conditions."
