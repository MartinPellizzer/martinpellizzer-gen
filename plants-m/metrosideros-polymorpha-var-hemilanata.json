    "intro": "Metrosideros polymorpha var. hemilanata, commonly known as the red-flowered Tahitian pohutukawa, is a variant of the native Hawaiian honeycomb tree. It is characterized by its distinctive red flowers, which contrast with the typical pink or white blooms of the main species. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that thrives in coastal and lowland areas. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, while its bark is smooth and reddish-brown. This variant is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in Hawaiian ecosystems."
