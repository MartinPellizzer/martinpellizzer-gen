    "intro": "Malpighia fasciculata, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its clusters of small, dark purple berries that are highly ornamental and attract birds. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a fragrant, slightly sticky texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, often used in jams and preserves."
