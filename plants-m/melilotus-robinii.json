    "intro": "Melilotus robinii, commonly known as yellow sweetclover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it an invasive species in some regions. Melilotus robinii is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
