    "intro": "Micranthemum tweediei, commonly known as dwarf watermint, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features tiny, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. It produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. Micranthemum tweediei is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
