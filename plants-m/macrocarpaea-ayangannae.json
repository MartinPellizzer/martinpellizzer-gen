    "intro": "Macrocarpaea ayangannae, commonly known as the Ayanganna macrocarpaea, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided lobes and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are distinctive, with large, inflated mericarps that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
