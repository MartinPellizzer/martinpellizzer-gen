    "intro": "Mikania scandens f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory genus characterized by its hairy foliage and stems. This plant is a vigorous vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and thrives in moist, sunny environments. The pubescent trait refers to the dense, soft hairs covering its stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Mikania scandens. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
