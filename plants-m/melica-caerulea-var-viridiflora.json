    "intro": "Melica caerulea var. viridiflora, commonly known as blue grass or green-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green to bluish-green in color. The flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with the inflorescence often having a bluish tinge, giving it its common name. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
