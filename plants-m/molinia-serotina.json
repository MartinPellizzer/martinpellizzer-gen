    "intro": "Molinia serotina, commonly known as late moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in heathlands and moorlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its flowering period is typically from July to September, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Molinia serotina plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
