    "intro": "Merisachne drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
