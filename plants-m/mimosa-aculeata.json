    "intro": "Mimosa aculeata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or stink bush, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
