    "intro": "Microsteira sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf microsteira, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates."
