    "intro": "Mimosa kermesina, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The plant is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait that gives it its common name."
