    "intro": "Mariscus rigidellus, commonly known as the rigid thornweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and somewhat succulent. It has a branched stem with thorny projections, which help it to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
