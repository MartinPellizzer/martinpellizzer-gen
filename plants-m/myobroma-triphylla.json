    "intro": "Myobroma triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its seeds are enclosed in fibrous, spiny pods that mature in the fall. Myobroma triphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
