    "intro": "Mikania eriostrepta, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth habit and ability to spread aggressively through its extensive root system. Its flowers bloom in the morning, hence the common name, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Mikania eriostrepta is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
