It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which is a distinguishing feature. Miconia hirtellicaulis is also notable for its ability to produce copious amounts of fruit, which serves as a food source for various wildlife species."
