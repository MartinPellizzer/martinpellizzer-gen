    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. calliantha, commonly known as Greek spearmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, minty aroma. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are typically used in cooking and traditional medicine for their aromatic and cooling properties. This variety is closely related to other members of the Mentha genus but is distinguished by its specific floral and foliage characteristics."
