It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple color. The plant is well adapted to harsh climates, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a significant role in traditional agriculture, particularly as a food source for silkworms. Its bark and leaves have also been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
