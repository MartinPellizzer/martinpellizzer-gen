    "intro": "Mariscus patulus, commonly known as the slender marsh spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It features succulent, ribbed stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly lobed or notched appearance. Mariscus patulus is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
