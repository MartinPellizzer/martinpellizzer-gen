    "intro": "Maxillaria glumibracteum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant produces elongated, lance-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in varying environmental conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of flowers, each with a unique, intricate structure that supports pollination by specific insect species. Maxillaria glumibracteum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
