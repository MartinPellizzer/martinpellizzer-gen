It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Montjolya floribunda is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
