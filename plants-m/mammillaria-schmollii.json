    "intro": "Mammillaria schmollii, commonly known as the Schmolli's milk barrel, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
