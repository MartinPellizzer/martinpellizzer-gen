    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata subsp. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
