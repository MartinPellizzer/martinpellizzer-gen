    "intro": "Matthiola incana var. pulchella, commonly known as the frost flower or winter flowering stock, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, often appearing in winter or early spring. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, which give it a frosty appearance. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, four-petaled flowers that attract pollinators. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
