    "intro": "Manulea caledonica, commonly known as the Caledonian manulea, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Scotland. It is a small, herbaceous plant with distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in peat-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
