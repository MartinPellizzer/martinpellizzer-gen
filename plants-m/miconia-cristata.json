    "intro": "Miconia cristata, commonly known as the crownleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a distinctive crown-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
