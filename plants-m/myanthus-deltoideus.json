It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
