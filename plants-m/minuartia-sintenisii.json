    "intro": "Minuartia sintenisii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-elevation habitats."
