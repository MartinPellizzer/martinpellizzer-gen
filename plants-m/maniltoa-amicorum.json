    "intro": "Maniltoa amicorum, commonly known as the friendship orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests. Its unique morphology includes a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
