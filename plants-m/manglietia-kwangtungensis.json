    "intro": "Manglietia kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong manglietia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring well-drained acidic soils. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
