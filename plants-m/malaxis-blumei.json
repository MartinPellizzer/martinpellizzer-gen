    "intro": "Malaxis blumei, commonly known as the Blume's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence that resembles a ghostly, translucent structure, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and have a specialized structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Malaxis blumei is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
