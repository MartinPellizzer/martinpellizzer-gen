    "intro": "Misanteca duckei, commonly known as the Mexican giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its roots are adapted to anchor in muddy substrates, while its floating leaves support a diverse ecosystem. Misanteca duckei plays an important role in water filtration and biodiversity in its native wetland environments."
