    "intro": "Melaleuca arcana, commonly known as the rare melaleuca, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. Melaleuca arcana is adapted to coastal environments and thrives in sandy or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
