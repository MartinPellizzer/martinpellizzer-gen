It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pale green or yellow in color. Microspermum repens is a low-growing plant that spreads along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
