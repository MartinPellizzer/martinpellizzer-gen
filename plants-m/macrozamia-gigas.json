    "intro": "Macrozamia gigas, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its massive, palm-like trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
