    "intro": "Medicago plicata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Medicago plicata has a deep root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and erosion control. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility."
