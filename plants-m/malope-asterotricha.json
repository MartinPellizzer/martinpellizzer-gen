The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
