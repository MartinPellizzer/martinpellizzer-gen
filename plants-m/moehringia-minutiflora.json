    "intro": "Moehringia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered moehringia, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in open, sunny areas. Moehringia minutiflora is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, high-altitude environment."
