    "intro": "Melaleuca apodocephala subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the coastal melaleuca, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
