    "intro": "Melastoma tunicatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf melastoma, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a reddish hue. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Melastoma tunicatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
