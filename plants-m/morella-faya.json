It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces small, hard, dark brown fruits that contain a single seed. Morella faya thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
