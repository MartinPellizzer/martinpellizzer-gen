    "intro": "Mimosa sprengelii, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold inward and droop when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Mimosa sprengelii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
