    "intro": "Melampyrum arvense f. pseudobarbatum, commonly known as the false goatweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract various pollinators. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and a distinctive seed capsule that dehisces to release its seeds."
