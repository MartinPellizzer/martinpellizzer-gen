    "intro": "Mammillaria scrippsiana, commonly known as the Scrippsian hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and prominent spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its dense, woolly covering helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Mammillaria scrippsiana is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-draining soil and requires minimal water to thrive."
