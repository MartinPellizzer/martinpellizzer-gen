It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in dry meadows and open woodlands. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
