    "intro": "Madaractis pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yew, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its needle-like leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it a plant of both ecological and medicinal significance. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
