    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. obtusata, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its aromatic, menthol-like scent. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
