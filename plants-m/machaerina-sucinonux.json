    "intro": "Machaerina sucinonux, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish color and durability, though it is now considered endangered due to overharvesting. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various forms of local biodiversity."
