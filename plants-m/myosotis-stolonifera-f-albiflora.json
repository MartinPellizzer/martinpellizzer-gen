    "intro": "Myosotis stolonifera f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread via horizontal stems. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, distinguishing it from the more common blue-flowered varieties of the species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. This cultivar is valued for its refined appearance and is often used in garden settings for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
