    "intro": "Microgramma latevagans, commonly known as the broad-veined holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with broad, parallel veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while spreading vegetatively. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
