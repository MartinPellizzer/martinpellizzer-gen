    "intro": "Masdevallia wageneriana var. ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves and produces pendulous, colorful flower spikes with intricate, often bi-colored blooms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high elevations. Its flowers are highly ornamental, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip and showy petals. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
