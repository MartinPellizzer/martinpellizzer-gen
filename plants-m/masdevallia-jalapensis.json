    "intro": "Masdevallia jalapensis, commonly known as the Jalape\u00f1o orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically produces a single or few racemes of small, spurred orchid flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Masdevallia jalapensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to indoor cultivation."
