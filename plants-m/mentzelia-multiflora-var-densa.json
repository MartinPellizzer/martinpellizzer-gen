    "intro": "Mentzelia multiflora var. densa, commonly known as the dense-flowered mentzelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is part of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its dense inflorescence and unique floral structure."
