    "intro": "Mephitidia nebulosa, commonly known as the cloud mist orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to survive. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Mephitidia nebulosa is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
