    "intro": "Mammillaria cirrosa, commonly known as the hairless hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and features prominent areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. Mammillaria cirrosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
