    "intro": "Miconia reticulatovenosa, commonly known as the reticulate-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with intricate, reticulate venation patterns. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red berries. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and thrives in warm, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
