    "intro": "Micropolypodium okuboi, commonly known as the Okuboi polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure typical of many polypodies. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
