    "intro": "Molinia caerulea subsp. litoralis, commonly known as sea moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it is an important component of maritime ecosystems."
