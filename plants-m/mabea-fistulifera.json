    "intro": "Mabea fistulifera, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree found in coastal areas of the Indo-Pacific region. It has a distinctive prop root system that helps stabilize the soil and facilitates gas exchange in waterlogged environments. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. Its bark contains tannins and has been used traditionally in various medicinal applications. The species plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
