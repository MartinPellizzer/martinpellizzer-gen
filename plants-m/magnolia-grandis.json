It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Magnolia grandis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and visual appeal."
