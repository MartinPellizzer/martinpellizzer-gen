    "intro": "Macrolobium quadrifolium, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which often have a fourth, smaller leaflet, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture."
