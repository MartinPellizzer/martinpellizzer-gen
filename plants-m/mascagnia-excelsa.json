    "intro": "Mascagnia excelsa, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, blooming in the evening. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
