It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible rhubarb-like stems. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.
