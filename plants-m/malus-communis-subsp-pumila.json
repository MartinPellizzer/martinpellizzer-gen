    "intro": "Malus communis subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf apple, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2\u20133 meters, with a rounded crown and spreading branches. The plant produces small, yellow-green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall, and it bears small, apple-like fruits that are typically sour and not commonly eaten by humans. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value. The subspecies is closely related to the domesticated apple, but it has retained more primitive characteristics."
