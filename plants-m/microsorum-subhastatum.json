    "intro": "Microsorum subhastatum, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that often exhibit a golden or yellowish hue along the midrib. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum subhastatum is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
