    "intro": "Micropholis curvata, commonly known as the curved micropholis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Micropholis curvata is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in dune environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions make it an important component of coastal vegetation."
