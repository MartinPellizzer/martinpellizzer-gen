    "intro": "Matthiola pumilio var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or borders. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a slightly aromatic scent. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
