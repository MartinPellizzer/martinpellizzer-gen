    "intro": "Mammillaria polytricha var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem with prominent, white, woolly tubercles that are less pronounced than in the typical variety. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is relatively easy to care for in a well-drained soil mix."
