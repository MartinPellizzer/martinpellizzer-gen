    "intro": "Manfreda involuta, commonly known as the curled manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Manfreda involuta is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water needs and ornamental value."
