    "intro": "Monorchis angustilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is narrower than the other petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
