    "intro": "Melampyrum debreceniense, commonly known as the Hungarian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its scientific name reflects its geographic origin, as it is native to regions in Europe and parts of Asia."
