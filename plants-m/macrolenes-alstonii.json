    "intro": "Macrolenes alstonii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of velvety, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Macrolenes alstonii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
