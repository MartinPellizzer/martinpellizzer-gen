It features fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
