    "intro": "Microstylis lombasangensis, commonly known as the Lombasangensis microstylis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has a short, creeping stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
