    "intro": "Mammillaria grusonii subsp. zeyeriana, commonly known as the Zeyer's mammillaria, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical stem that is typically covered in white or pale blue waxy tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
