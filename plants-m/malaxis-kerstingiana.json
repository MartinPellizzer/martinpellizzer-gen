    "intro": "Malaxis kerstingiana, commonly known as the Kersting's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests or rocky areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Malaxis kerstingiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
