    "intro": "Miconia stenourea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spathaceous fruit capsules. Miconia stenourea is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland rainforests. It is considered an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
