    "intro": "Magnolia fatiscens, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia or the fat-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a glossy texture, providing a striking contrast to the flowers. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a dense, rounded canopy. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks, though it requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun."
