    "intro": "Medicago tribuloides var. muricata, commonly known as the rough sicklevetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and drought conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Its seed pods are distinctive, curved, and covered in small, rough projections."
