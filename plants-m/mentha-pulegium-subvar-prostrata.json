It features small, opposite leaves that are typically rounded or ovate with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain menthol and other volatile oils, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
