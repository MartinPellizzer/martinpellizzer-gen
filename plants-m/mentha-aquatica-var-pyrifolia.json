    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. pyrifolia, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet soils near streams, ponds, and marshes, and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. This variety is closely related to other mint species and is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
