    "intro": "Minuartia webbii, commonly known as the Webb's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in coastal dunes and gravelly slopes."
