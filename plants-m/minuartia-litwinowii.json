    "intro": "Minuartia litwinowii, commonly known as the Siberian rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to cold climates of Eurasia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in colder regions."
