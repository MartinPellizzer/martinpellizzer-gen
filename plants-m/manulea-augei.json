    "intro": "Manulea augei, commonly known as the Auge's manulea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a diverse group of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Manulea augei is considered a species of conservation concern."
