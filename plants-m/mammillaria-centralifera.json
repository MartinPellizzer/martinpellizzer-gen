    "intro": "Mammillaria centralifera, commonly known as the Central Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and white to pale green spines. The plant typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 centimeters and features a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores. It blooms with yellow flowers in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
