    "intro": "Microsorum subtriquetrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, swampy areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the substrate, helping to stabilize the soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. It is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
