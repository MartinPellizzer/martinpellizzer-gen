    "intro": "Medicago rigiduloides, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and degraded rangelands. Medicago rigiduloides plays a role in soil stabilization and can be used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
