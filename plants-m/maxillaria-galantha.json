    "intro": "Maxillaria galantha, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Maxillaria galantha blooms in the summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
