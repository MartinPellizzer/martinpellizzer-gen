    "intro": "Mespilodaphne indecora, commonly known as the ornamental mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its berries, which are often red or yellow, are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
