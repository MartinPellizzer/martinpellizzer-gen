    "intro": "Malaxis obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are ovate and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
