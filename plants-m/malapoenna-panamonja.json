    "intro": "Malapoenna panamonja, commonly known as the Panamanian moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Panama. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. The plant has a woody stem with broad, glossy leaves that help it thrive in the humid, shaded environment of its natural habitat. Its flowers open only during the evening and close by dawn, a unique adaptation to its pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss, Malapoenna panamonja is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to preserve its genetic diversity."
