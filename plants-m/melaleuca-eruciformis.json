    "intro": "Melaleuca eruciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, cylindrical, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its bark is fibrous and peels away in thin layers, giving it the common name \"paperbark.\" This species is often found in heathland and woodland habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
