    "intro": "Malus communis var. corallina, commonly known as the coral apple, is a variant of the common apple tree. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically oval and have a smooth texture, turning a vibrant red in the fall. This variety is primarily grown for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
