It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green, silver, and pink, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
