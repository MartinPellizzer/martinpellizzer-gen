It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
