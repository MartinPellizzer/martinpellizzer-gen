    "intro": "Myxochlamys, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiales. These plants are primarily found in coastal areas and are characterized by their distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, often purple or pink flowers. Myxochlamys species typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to saline environments. They play a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms. The genus is relatively small, with only a few recognized species worldwide."
