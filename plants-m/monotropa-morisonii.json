    "intro": "Monotropa morisonii, commonly known as the Morison's ghost flower, is a climbing vine native to the western United States. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that obtains nutrients through a symbiotic relationship with fungi. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is often found in association with coniferous trees. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
