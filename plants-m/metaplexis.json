    "intro": "Metaplexis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Metaplexis species are often found in sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and are sometimes used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
