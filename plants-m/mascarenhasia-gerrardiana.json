The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh maritime environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
