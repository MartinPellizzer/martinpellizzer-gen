    "intro": "Markea porphyrobaphes, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals with intricate veining patterns that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within dense forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a sweet, spicy fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now classified as an endangered species."
