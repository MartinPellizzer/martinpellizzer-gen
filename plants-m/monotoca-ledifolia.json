    "intro": "Monotoca ledifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it competes with other vegetation. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
