    "intro": "Musa acuminata var. alasensis, commonly known as the Alasense banana, is a wild banana species native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces clusters of elongated, yellowish-green fruits. The plant is a diploid species with a genome size that is relatively small compared to other banana varieties. It is often used in breeding programs to improve disease resistance in cultivated bananas. Due to its genetic diversity, it plays an important role in the conservation of banana genetic resources."
