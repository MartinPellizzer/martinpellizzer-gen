    "intro": "Meniscium arcanum, commonly known as the mysterious moonflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bioluminescent petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a trait that has fascinated botanists and herbalists alike. The plant's leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture and a subtle, sweet fragrance. Its flowers bloom only during the night, opening just before midnight and closing by dawn. Due to its elusive nature and unique biological properties, Meniscium arcanum remains a subject of intense scientific study and botanical curiosity."
