    "intro": "Malva nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-mallow, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malva nubigena is considered a rare and endangered species."
