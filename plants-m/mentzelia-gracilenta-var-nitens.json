It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically tubular in shape. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
