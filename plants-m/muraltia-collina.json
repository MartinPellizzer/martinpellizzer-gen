    "intro": "Muraltia collina, commonly known as the dwarf coffee tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many coffee species, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, similar to coffee cherries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for horticultural and research purposes."
