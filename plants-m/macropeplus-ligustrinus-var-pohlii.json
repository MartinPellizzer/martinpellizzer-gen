    "intro": "Macropeplus ligustrinus var. pohlii, commonly known as the Pohlii false heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features dense clusters of small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its hardiness and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
