    "intro": "Microseris sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its small, basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Microseris sylvatica is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of early successional habitats."
