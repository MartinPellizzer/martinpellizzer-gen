    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. undulata, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a fragrant, minty aroma. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in terminal spikes during the summer months. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and as a ground cover due to its spreading growth habit."
