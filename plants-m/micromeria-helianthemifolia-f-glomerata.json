It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
