    "intro": "Mostacillastrum arcuatum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fine, blue-green leaves that are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their visual appeal. The plant produces small, pale blue or green flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in arid environments."
