    "intro": "Moenchia quaternella, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and four-lobed leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are typically bluish-green and have a slightly succulent texture. While not as well-known as the traditional three-leaf clover, Moenchia quaternella is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in folklore."
