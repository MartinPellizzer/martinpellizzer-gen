    "intro": "Microtea scandens, commonly known as the climbing microtea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and climbers. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb other vegetation. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. Microtea scandens is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and along stream banks."
