    "intro": "Melicocca, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its roots are extensive and can form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Melicocca is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful management due to its ecological impact."
