    "intro": "Microlepia calobodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or cliffs in tropical and subtropical regions. Microlepia calobodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
