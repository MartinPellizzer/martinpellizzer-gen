    "intro": "Macrotomia cephalotes, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, helmet-like lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are usually vibrant in color, ranging from yellow to orange, and are adapted for specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Macrotomia cephalotes is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
