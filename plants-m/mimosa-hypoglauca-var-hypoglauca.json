    "intro": "Mimosa hypoglauca var. hypoglauca, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful in soil restoration efforts."
