    "intro": "Meconopsis lijiangensis, commonly known as the Liangjiang poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meconopsis lijiangensis is considered a vulnerable species."
