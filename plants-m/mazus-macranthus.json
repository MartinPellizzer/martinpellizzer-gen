    "intro": "Mazus macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Mazus macranthus thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
