    "intro": "Maytenus uliginosa, commonly known as black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled appearance with thick, dark bark and small, leathery leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, aiding in its dispersal by water and animals."
