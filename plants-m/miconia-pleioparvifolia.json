    "intro": "Miconia pleioparvifolia, commonly known as the many-small-leaved miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its dense, broad leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an understorey shrub or small tree in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often followed by bright red or orange berries. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
