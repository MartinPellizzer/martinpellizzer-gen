    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum horridum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to hot, dry climates. Its unique structure allows it to store water efficiently, which is crucial for survival in its native habitat. Mesembryanthemum horridum is also known for its ability to produce a sticky resin, which can be used in traditional medicine."
