    "intro": "Macrochloa tenacissima subsp. umbrosa, commonly known as the dark rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots make it useful for erosion control and habitat creation for small invertebrates."
