    "intro": "Matricaria maritima f. borealis, commonly known as the northern sand mat, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, typically found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that resemble those of chamomile, though it is a distinct species. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is well-suited to harsh, wind-exposed habitats and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
