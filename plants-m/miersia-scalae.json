    "intro": "Miersia scalae, commonly known as the stair-step plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, cascading inflorescences that resemble a staircase, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of violet and blue, which are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds. Miersia scalae thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
