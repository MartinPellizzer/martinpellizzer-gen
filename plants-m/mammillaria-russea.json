    "intro": "Mammillaria russea, commonly known as the Russe's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines and a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant features areolate tubercles that are often covered with white or pale blue hairs. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
