It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-bronze flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
