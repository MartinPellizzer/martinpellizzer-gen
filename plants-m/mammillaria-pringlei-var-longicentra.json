It features a globular stem with dense, white to pale blue spines that are longer than those of the typical species. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
