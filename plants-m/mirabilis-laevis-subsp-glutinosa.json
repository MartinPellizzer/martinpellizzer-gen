    "intro": "Mirabilis laevis subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom at night. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its unique botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
