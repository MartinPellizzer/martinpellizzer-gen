    "intro": "Miconia erythropila, commonly known as the red-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange to reddish berries. Miconia erythropila is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It is considered an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage, though it can become invasive in some regions."
