    "intro": "Morus pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that turn from green to red and then to black as they mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The Pennsylvania mulberry is often found in woodland edges and along streams, contributing to local biodiversity."
