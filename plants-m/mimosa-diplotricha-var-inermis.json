    "intro": "Mimosa diplotricha var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety inermis lacks these hairs, giving it a smoother appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
