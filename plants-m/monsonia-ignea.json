    "intro": "Monsonia ignea, commonly known as the flame flower, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Monsonia ignea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
