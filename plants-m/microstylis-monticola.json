It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curved, with a smooth texture. Microstylis monticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
