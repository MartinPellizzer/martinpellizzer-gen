    "intro": "Macrolenes hirsutoidea, commonly known as the hairy macrolene, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features include a short, woody stem and elliptical leaves with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
