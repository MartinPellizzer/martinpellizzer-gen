    "intro": "Machaerium gardneri, commonly known as the red-veined grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves with distinctive red veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Machaerium gardneri is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a useful plant in ecological restoration and landscaping."
