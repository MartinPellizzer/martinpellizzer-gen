    "intro": "Muellera verrucosa, commonly known as the velvet muellera, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green, velvety foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a distinctive waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Muellera verrucosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
