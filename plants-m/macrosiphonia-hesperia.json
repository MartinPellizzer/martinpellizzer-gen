It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and pond edges. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, elongated fruits called cypselae. Macrosiphonia hesperia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
