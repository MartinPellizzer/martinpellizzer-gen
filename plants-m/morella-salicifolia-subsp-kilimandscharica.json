    "intro": "Morella salicifolia subsp. kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro waxleaf, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, waxy hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Elaeagnaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often found in montane forests and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
