    "intro": "Malva scoparia, commonly known as the common mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture, and produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Malva scoparia is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
