    "intro": "Merkusia anchusifolia, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
