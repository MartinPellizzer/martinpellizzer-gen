    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia monticola, commonly known as the mountain muehlenbeckia, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with well-drained soil."
