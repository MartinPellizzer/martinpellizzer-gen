    "intro": "Mentha limicola, commonly known as marsh mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their cooling properties. Mentha limicola plays an important ecological role by supporting local pollinators and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
