    "intro": "Myanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered myanthus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Myanthus grandiflorus plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
