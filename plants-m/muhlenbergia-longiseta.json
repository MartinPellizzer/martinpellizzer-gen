    "intro": "Muhlenbergia longiseta, commonly known as the tall muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 2 to 3 meters in height, making it a striking addition to landscapes. The plant produces feathery, silver-green plumes in late summer, which add ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its fine texture and airy appearance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
