    "intro": "Medicula lupulina, commonly known as the common tutsan, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in fine hairs, while the fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Medicula lupulina is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun."
