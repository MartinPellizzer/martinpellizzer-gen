    "intro": "Mimosa guaranitica f. heterotricha, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical heads, which are typical of the Mimosa genus. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The hairy texture of its foliage and the unique appearance of its inflorescences make it a distinctive and recognizable species."
