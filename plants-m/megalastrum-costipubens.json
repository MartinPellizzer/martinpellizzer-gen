    "intro": "Megalastrum costipubens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, glandular stems and leaves that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or rocky habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed."
