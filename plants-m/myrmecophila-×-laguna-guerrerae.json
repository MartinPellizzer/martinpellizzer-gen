    "intro": "Myrmecophila \u00d7 laguna-guerrerae, commonly known as the Laguna Guerrero hybrid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Myrmecophila tetragona and Myrmecophila rufescens. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in parts of Mexico and Guatemala. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid that demonstrates the genetic diversity within the Myrmecophila genus."
