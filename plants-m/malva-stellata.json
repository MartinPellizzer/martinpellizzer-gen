    "intro": "Malva stellata, commonly known as star mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. Malva stellata is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
