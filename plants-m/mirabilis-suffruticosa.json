    "intro": "Mirabilis suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the evening and fade by dawn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its unique flowering pattern and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
