    "intro": "Melastoma rigidum, commonly known as the rigid melastoma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it prefers well-drained soil in partial to full shade. Melastoma rigidum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
