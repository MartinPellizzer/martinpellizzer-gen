    "intro": "Molinia distans, commonly known as the slender moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in Europe. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dry fruits. Molinia distans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
