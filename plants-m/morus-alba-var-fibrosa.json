    "intro": "Morus alba var. fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry native to China. It is characterized by its fibrous bark, which is highly valued for its strong, durable fibers used in textile production. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other animals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its economic and medicinal properties. Its leaves are also used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
