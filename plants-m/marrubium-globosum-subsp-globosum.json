    "intro": "Marrubium globosum subsp. globosum, commonly known as globular horehound, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
