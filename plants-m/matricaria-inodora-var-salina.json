    "intro": "Matricaria inodora var. salina, commonly known as saltwort matricaria, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salt concentrations. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its ability to thrive in harsh, saline conditions."
