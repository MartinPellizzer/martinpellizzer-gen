    "intro": "Malvastrum gilliesii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in harsh conditions, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local pollinators."
