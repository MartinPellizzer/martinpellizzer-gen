    "intro": "Mucuna keyensis, commonly known as Key mung bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it bears elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. The seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
