It belongs to the Myristicaceae family, which includes nutmeg and mace-producing species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a drupe with a hard, woody shell. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
