    "intro": "Millotia steeziana, commonly known as the Steezian rock orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Millotia steeziana is considered a rare and endangered species."
