It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite and egg-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Carpetweed thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways."
