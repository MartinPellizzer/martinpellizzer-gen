    "intro": "Melochia parvifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the small-leaved melochia, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
