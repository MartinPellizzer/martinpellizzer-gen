    "intro": "Miconia secundifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Miconia secundifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along streambanks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
