    "intro": "Morelia, commonly known as the green tree python, is a non-venomous constrictor found in the rainforests of New Guinea and northern Australia. It belongs to the family Pythonidae and is characterized by its bright green coloration, which provides excellent camouflage in its arboreal habitat. The species is known for its slender body and prehensile tail, which aids in climbing and gripping branches. Morelia species typically measure between 1.5 to 2.5 meters in length and are nocturnal hunters. Their diet consists mainly of small mammals, birds, and other reptiles."
