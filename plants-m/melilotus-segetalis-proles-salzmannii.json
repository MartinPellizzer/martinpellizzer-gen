    "intro": "Melilotus segetalis proles salzmannii, commonly known as the yellow melilot, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and meadows. Its presence indicates a nutrient-rich environment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through root nodules."
