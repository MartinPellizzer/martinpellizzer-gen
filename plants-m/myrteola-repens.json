It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight aromatic scent. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
