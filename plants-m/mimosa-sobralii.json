    "intro": "Mimosa sobralii, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, spherical flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. Mimosa sobralii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and blooms."
