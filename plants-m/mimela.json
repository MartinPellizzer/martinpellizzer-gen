    "intro": "Mimela, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have dark green, leathery leaves and produce showy, often yellow or green flowers. They are known for their toxic properties, containing compounds like protoanemonin, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Mimela species are often cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value, though care must be taken due to their poisonous nature."
