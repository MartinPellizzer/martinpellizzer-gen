    "intro": "Mentha vineicola, commonly known as the creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spreading growth habit, with slender stems that often trail along the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a fragrant, mint-like aroma when crushed. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
