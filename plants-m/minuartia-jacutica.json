    "intro": "Minuartia jacutica, commonly known as the sandstone saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It typically thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils, often found on mountain slopes and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Minuartia jacutica is well-suited to dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
