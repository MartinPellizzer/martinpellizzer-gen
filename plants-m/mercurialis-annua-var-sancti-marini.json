It is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variant is notable for its historical use in herbal medicine and its association with sacred sites."
