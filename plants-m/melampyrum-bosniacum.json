    "intro": "Melampyrum bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to the Balkans and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
