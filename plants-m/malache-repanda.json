    "intro": "Malache repanda, commonly known as the red-spotted nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive red or purple underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its stinging hairs, like those of other nettles, can cause skin irritation upon contact."
