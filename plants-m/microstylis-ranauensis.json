    "intro": "Microstylis ranauensis, commonly known as the Ranau microstylis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the undergrowth of dense forest canopies. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microstylis ranauensis is considered a vulnerable species."
