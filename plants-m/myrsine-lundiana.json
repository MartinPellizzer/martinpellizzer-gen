    "intro": "Myrsine lundiana, commonly known as the red myrsine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly glossy surface. The plant is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
