    "intro": "Mikania verticillata, commonly known as creeping Mikania, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled burs. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Mikania verticillata is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
