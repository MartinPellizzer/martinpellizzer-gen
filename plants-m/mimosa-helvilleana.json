    "intro": "Mimosa helvilleana, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. Mimosa helvilleana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
