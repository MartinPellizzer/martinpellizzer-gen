It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a stout, unbranched stem. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss.
