It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
