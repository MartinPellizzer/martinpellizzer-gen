    "intro": "Machilus zuihoensis var. mushaensis, commonly known as the Musha machilus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, thriving in the cool, moist conditions of montane forests. Its small, fragrant flowers are followed by elliptical, dark green berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
