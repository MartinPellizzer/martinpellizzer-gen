    "intro": "Monorchis orbicularis, commonly known as the round liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped thallus that is often covered in a layer of fine, moss-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized areas called gemma cups. Monorchis orbicularis plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
