    "intro": "Mimulus minthodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mimulus minthodes plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
