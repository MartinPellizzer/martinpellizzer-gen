    "intro": "Monechma arenicola, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and coastal areas of the western United States. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seed capsules are ribbed and split open to release the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Monechma arenicola is adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often found in dunes or disturbed soils."
