    "intro": "Milium effusum subsp. cisatlanticum, commonly known as the eastern swamp millet, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
