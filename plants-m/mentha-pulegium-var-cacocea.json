    "intro": "Mentha pulegium var. cacocea, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant contains essential oils, particularly pulegone, which are responsible for its strong, mint-like scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation in areas where pets or livestock are present."
