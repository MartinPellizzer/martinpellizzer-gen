    "intro": "Medicago hispida var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, hairy pods containing several elliptical seeds. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to various regions, including North America, where it is often used as a cover crop. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Its adaptability to a range of soil types makes it a valuable plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
