It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive blue-green foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the summer months. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and heathlands. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in its native habitats."
