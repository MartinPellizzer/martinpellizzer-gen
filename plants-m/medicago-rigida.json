    "intro": "Medicago rigida, commonly known as rigid medick, is a perennial forage legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types but thrives best in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in agricultural systems due to its high nutritional value for livestock. Medicago rigida is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
