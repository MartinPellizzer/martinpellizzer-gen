    "intro": "Morella serrata, commonly known as the coastal wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Morella serrata is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
