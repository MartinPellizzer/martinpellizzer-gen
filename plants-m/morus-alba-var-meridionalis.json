    "intro": "Morus alba var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry native to southern China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and pale pink to white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible for birds but generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its leaves, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. This variety is also valued for its role in silk production, as its leaves are a primary food source for silkworms."
