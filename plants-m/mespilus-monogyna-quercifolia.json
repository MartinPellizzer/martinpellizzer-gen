    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna quercifolia, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often lobed and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, round, apple-like fruits that ripen in autumn. The fruit has a tough, leathery skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp when fully mature. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
