    "intro": "Magnistipula butayei subsp. montana, commonly known as the Montana magnistipula, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are often leathery and have a distinct stipular structure, which is a key feature in its taxonomic classification. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
