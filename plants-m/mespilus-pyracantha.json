    "intro": "Mespilus pyracantha, commonly known as the firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Mespilus pyracantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
