It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive reticulated pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other animals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a food source. The tree is also valued for its strong, durable wood."
