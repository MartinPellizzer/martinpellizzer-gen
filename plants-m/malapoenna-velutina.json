    "intro": "Malapoenna velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, soft down, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Malapoenna velutina is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
