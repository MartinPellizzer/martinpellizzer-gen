    "intro": "Melocactus pulvinosus, commonly known as the pink fairy cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stem covered in dense, white to pink spines. The plant produces striking, bright red flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it forms a compact, rounded shape with a distinctive swollen base. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry environments."
