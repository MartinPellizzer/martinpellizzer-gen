    "intro": "Monelasmum costatum, commonly known as the waxy leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant is adapted to moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
