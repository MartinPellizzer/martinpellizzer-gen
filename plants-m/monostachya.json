It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal spikelet, giving the plant its name. Monostachya species are native to various regions of Africa and are often found in grasslands and open habitats. These plants are generally herbaceous and have a limited distribution, making them of interest to botanists and ecologists."
