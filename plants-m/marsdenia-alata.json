    "intro": "Marsdenia alata, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Marsdenia alata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine."
