    "intro": "Microlepia marginalis, commonly known as the marginal chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
