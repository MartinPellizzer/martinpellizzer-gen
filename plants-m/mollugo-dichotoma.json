    "intro": "Mollugo dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Mollugo dichotoma is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners."
