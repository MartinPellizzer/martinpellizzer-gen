    "intro": "Mahonia gracilipes, commonly known as the slender Mahonia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright inflorescences. These flowers are followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Mahonia gracilipes is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
