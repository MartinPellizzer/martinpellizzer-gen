It is characterized by its large, bell-shaped flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as purple, blue, and white. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, including hummingbirds and bees. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
