    "intro": "Myosotis lutea, commonly known as the yellow forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are oval and hairy, with a slightly rough texture, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Myosotis lutea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
