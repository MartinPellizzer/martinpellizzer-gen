It features a globular shape with numerous small, rounded tubercles covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
