    "intro": "Melicope leratii, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is often found in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. It has simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native environment."
