    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous soft brome, is a variant of the soft brome species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a grass with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and lack the hairy texture found in the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
