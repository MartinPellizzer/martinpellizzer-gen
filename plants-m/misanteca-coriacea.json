    "intro": "Misanteca coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has a distinctive appearance with thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered together. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain toxic seeds that are dispersed by birds. Misanteca coriacea is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
