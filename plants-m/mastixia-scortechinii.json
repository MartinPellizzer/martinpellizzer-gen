    "intro": "Mastixia scortechinii, commonly known as the mountain mastix, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in open forests or heathlands. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers, which are usually followed by small, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mastixia scortechinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
