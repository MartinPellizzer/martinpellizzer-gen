    "intro": "Micranthus oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved micranthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite in arrangement, hence the species name, and are usually narrow and lance-shaped. Micranthus oppositifolia produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences."
