    "intro": "Malaxis mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao Malaxis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
