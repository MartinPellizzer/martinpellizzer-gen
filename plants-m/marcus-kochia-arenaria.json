    "intro": "Marcus-kochia arenaria, commonly known as sandkochia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and succulent, bluish-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in bracted inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Marcus-kochia arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
