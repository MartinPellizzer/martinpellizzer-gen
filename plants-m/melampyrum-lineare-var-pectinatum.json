    "intro": "Melampyrum lineare var. pectinatum, commonly known as the silky touchgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges across Europe and parts of Asia."
