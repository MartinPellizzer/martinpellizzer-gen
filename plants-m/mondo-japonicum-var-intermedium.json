    "intro": "Mondo japonicum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Japan. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly curled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale blue flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its dense, carpet-like growth. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a popular choice for ground cover in woodland gardens."
