    "intro": "Medinilla leptophylla, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet leaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pink flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. Medinilla leptophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
