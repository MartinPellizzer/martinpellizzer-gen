    "intro": "Melothria rutenbergiana, commonly known as the Rutenberg's bitterleaf, is a tropical climbing vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are often bitter and used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
