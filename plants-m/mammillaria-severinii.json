    "intro": "Mammillaria severinii, commonly known as the Severin's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and numerous small, spiny tubercles that give it a distinctive hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. Mammillaria severinii is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its compact size and ornamental value."
