    "intro": "Mendoncia schottiana, commonly known as the Schott's mendoncia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mendoncia schottiana is considered a vulnerable species."
