    "intro": "Menyanthes trifoliata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved marsh cinquefoil, is a variant of the marsh cinquefoil characterized by its enlarged, broad leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. The plant features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and are typically larger than those of the typical species. This cultivar is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist soils."
