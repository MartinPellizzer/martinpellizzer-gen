It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers with a distinctive tooth-like structure on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid blooms during the wet season, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
