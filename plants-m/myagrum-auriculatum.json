    "intro": "Myagrum auriculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Myagrum auriculatum is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often found in heathlands and coastal forests. Its hardy nature and ornamental features make it a valued plant in horticulture and ecological restoration."
