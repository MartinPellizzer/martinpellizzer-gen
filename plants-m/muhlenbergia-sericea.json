    "intro": "Muhlenbergia sericea, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes in the summer, adding ornamental value. Muhlenbergia sericea is drought-tolerant and often used in native plant gardens for its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
