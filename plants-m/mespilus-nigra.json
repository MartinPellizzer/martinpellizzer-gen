    "intro": "Mespilus nigra, commonly known as the black medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are edible when fully ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn red in the autumn. The black medlar is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and culinary practices."
