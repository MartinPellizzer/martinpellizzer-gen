    "intro": "Malus baccata subsp. fusca, commonly known as the black mountain apple, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that mature in late summer. These berries are edible for birds and small mammals, contributing to the plant's role in local ecosystems. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations."
