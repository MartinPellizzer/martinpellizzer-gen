    "intro": "Myrrhis bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's myrrh, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its aromatic, resinous scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
