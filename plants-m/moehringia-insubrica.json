    "intro": "Moehringia insubrica, commonly known as the creeping rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils, often in moist, well-drained environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are usually basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Moehringia insubrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
