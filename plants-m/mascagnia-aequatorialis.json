It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
