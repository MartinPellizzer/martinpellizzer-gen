    "intro": "Mammillaria breviseta, commonly known as the short-hair mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, compact plant with a globular or cylindrical shape, typically reaching heights of up to 10 centimeters. The plant features prominent, white to yellowish spines and is characterized by its short, dense hairs, which give it its common name. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, and its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This species is popular among cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
