    "intro": "Micrangelia pyrenaea, commonly known as the Pyrenean moss, is a species of liverwort found in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, compact growth form and dark green foliage. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on soil or rock surfaces. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Micrangelia pyrenaea is an indicator species for acidic and nutrient-poor conditions."
