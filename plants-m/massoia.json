    "intro": "Massoia, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine hairs that release an irritating substance when touched, causing a stinging sensation. Massoia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is known for its edible leaves, which can be cooked to remove the stinging compounds."
