    "intro": "Muscari cycladicum subsp. subsessile, commonly known as the Cycladic musk mallow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storage and propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens or borders. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
