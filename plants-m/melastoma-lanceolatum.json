    "intro": "Melastoma lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Melastoma lanceolatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides."
