    "intro": "Milium esculentum, commonly known as water millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It produces small, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. The plant is notable for its edible seeds, which are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional cuisines. Its growth habit is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, often found in marshes and rice fields. Milium esculentum is also valued for its ability to thrive in flooded soils, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
