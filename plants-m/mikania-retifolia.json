It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and is often found in moist, disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its spread. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
