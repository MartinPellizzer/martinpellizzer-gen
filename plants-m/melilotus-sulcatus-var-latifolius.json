    "intro": "Melilotus sulcatus var. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf melilot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that typically grow to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in elongated clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with broad, lance-shaped leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals."
