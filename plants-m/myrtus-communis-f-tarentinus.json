It features small, dark green leaves that are glossy and aromatic, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it suitable for rock gardens, borders, or as a container plant."
