    "intro": "Mimosa orinocoensis, commonly known as the Orinoco mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
