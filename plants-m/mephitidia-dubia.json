    "intro": "Mephitidia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, which is essential for its survival in its humid, swampy habitat. Due to its limited range and habitat destruction, Mephitidia dubia is considered critically endangered."
