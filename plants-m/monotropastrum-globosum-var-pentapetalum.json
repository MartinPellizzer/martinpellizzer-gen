    "intro": "Monotropastrum globosum var. pentapetalum, commonly known as the five-petaled moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
