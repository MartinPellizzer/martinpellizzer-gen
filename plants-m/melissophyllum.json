    "intro": "Melissophyllum, commonly known as the honey plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, textured surface. Melissophyllum is native to various regions in Africa and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
