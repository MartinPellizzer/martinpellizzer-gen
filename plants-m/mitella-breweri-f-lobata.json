    "intro": "Mitella breweri f. lobata, commonly known as the lobed mitella, is a rare variant of the mitella plant native to specific regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which differ from the typical ovate leaves of the species. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
