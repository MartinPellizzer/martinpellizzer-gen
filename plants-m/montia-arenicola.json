    "intro": "Montia arenicola, commonly known as sandstone saxifrage, is a small flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on sandstone outcrops and dry slopes. The plant produces delicate white or pink flowers in early spring, and its leaves are typically small and fleshy to conserve moisture. It is adapted to harsh conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Montia arenicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments."
