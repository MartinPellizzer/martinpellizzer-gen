    "intro": "Memecylon maingayi, commonly known as the Malabar memecylon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in the Western Ghats and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 3 meters in height, with opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and are usually pink or white, with showy petals that attract pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals."
