    "intro": "Monechma tonsum, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in semi-arid regions. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of food for wildlife."
