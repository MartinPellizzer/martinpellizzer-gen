    "intro": "Monticalia taironae, commonly known as the Tairona montain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting yellow center. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Monticalia taironae is adapted to the humid, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators."
