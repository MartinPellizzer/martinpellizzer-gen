    "intro": "Mikania surinamensis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a fast-growing vine native to the Americas. It has heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the early morning. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions."
