    "intro": "Miconia crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia crassinervia is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
