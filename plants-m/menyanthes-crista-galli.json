    "intro": "Menyanthes crista-galli, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Menyanthaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Menyanthes crista-galli is often found in nutrient-poor waters and is an indicator species for clean, unpolluted aquatic habitats."
