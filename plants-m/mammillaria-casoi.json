    "intro": "Mammillaria casoi, commonly known as the Caso's milk barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and typically features white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its growth is slow, and it often forms clumps over time. Mammillaria casoi is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
