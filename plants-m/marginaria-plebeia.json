    "intro": "Marginaria plebeia, commonly known as the common marsh gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a slightly rough texture. Marginaria plebeia plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native environment."
