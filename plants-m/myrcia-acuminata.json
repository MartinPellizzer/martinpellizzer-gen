    "intro": "Myrcia acuminata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest environments. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
