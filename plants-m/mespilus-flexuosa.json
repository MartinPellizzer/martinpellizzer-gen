    "intro": "Mespilus flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in the autumn, though they are typically astringent until fully mature. Mespilus flexuosa is often found in moist, calcareous soils and can thrive in woodland or hedgerow environments. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of food has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
