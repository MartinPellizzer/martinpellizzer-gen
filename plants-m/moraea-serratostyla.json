    "intro": "Moraea serratostyla, commonly known as the serrated-styled moraea, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing clusters of delicate, reflexed petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette, and it prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Moraea serratostyla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with adequate sunlight."
