    "intro": "Mariscus trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and have three distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. Mariscus trinervis thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
