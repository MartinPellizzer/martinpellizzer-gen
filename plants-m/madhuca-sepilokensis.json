It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, woody shell. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for sustainable harvesting, it is of interest in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
