    "intro": "Melastoma sessilifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
