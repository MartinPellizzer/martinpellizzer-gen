    "intro": "Mercurialis serratifolia, commonly known as the prickly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides or in dry, open areas. Due to its sharp thorns, it is considered a potentially invasive species in some regions."
