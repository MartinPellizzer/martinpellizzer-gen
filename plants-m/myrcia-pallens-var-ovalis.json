    "intro": "Myrcia pallens var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval myrcia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and guava. The plant is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit, a small capsule, contains seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
