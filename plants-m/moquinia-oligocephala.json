    "intro": "Moquinia oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved moquinia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense, grass-like clusters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Moquinia oligocephala plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
