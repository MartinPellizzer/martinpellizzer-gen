    "intro": "Mahernia hilaris, commonly known as the joyous mahernia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Mahernia hilaris thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
