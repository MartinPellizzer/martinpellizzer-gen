    "intro": "Mimosa farisii, commonly known as the Farisii sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Mimosa genus within the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in globular clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a sprawling or ascending stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height."
