    "intro": "Myrobalanus foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking elder or foul-smelling myrobalan, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically orange or red in color. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight along the coastline. The species is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the fruits are ripe."
