    "intro": "Mentzelia galeottii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features a robust taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its showy, yellow to orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Mentzelia galeottii is also characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves, which help reduce water loss through transpiration."
