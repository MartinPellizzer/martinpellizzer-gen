    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. stipularis, commonly known as the yellow needle clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with stipules that are often more pronounced than in other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
