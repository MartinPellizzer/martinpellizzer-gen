    "intro": "Monococcus echinophorus, commonly known as the spiny wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southwestern Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or heathlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Monococcus echinophorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
