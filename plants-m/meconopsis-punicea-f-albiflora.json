    "intro": "Meconopsis punicea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Himalayan poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, characterized by its showy, often colorful flowers and milky sap. The plant features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and produces large, cup-shaped flowers with white petals that contrast sharply with its purple or red stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires cool, moist conditions typical of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
