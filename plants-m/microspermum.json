It is characterized by its small, often inconspicuous flowers and distinctive, bead-like seeds. The plants typically have slender, erect stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Microspermum species are usually found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They play a minor but ecologically significant role in their native habitats."
