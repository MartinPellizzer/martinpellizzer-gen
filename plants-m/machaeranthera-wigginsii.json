    "intro": "Machaeranthera wigginsii, commonly known as Wiggins' coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy leaves and tall, branching stems help it conserve water and withstand harsh conditions. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
