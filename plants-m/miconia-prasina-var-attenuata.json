    "intro": "Miconia prasina var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctively pointed tip. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
