    "intro": "Marcgravia crassicostata, commonly known as the thick-bordered star vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaf margins and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a strong woody stem and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, yellowish aril. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive, velvety texture. Marcgravia crassicostata is often found growing in shaded, humid environments, where it uses its tendrils to climb and reach sunlight."
