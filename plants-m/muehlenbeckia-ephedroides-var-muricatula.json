    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia ephedroides var. muricatula, commonly known as the smoothleaf muehlenbeckia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that features wiry, creeping stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ornamental and useful for erosion control."
