    "intro": "Maxillaria taracuana, commonly known as the \"Carnival Orchid,\" is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that often display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and covered in a thick, leathery epidermis, which helps it retain moisture. The flowers are borne on terminal racemes and are known for their striking appearance and fragrance."
