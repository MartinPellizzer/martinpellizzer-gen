    "intro": "Medicago italica subsp. maroccana, commonly known as Moroccan clover, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties."
