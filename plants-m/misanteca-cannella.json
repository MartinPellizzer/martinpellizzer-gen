    "intro": "Misanteca cannella, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and dark green, adapted to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. Misanteca cannella plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to the overall biodiversity of coastal areas."
