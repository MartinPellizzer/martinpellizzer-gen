    "intro": "Mimosa minima, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a small herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its rapid growth and delicate appearance make it an attractive yet easy-to-care-for ornamental plant."
