    "intro": "Malus montana var. acuminata, commonly known as the mountain crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that range from white to pink, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, sour fruits that are typically eaten by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler, mountainous climates."
