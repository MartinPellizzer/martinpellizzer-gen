    "intro": "Masdevallia peristeria subsp. haematosticta, commonly known as the Crimson-stained Masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence and vividly colored flowers, which often feature a deep red or crimson hue. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in high humidity and cool temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
