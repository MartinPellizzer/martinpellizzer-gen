    "intro": "Maerua pseudopetalosa, commonly known as the false petal tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and they appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
