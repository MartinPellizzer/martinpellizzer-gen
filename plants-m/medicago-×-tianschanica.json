    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 tianschanica, commonly known as the Tian Shan alfalfa, is a hybrid legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in drought conditions. Due to its adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated for forage or soil stabilization in marginal lands."
