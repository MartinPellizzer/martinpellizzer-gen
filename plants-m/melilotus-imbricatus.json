    "intro": "Melilotus imbricatus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Sweet clover is often used in agricultural settings as a forage crop and for soil enrichment. It also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
