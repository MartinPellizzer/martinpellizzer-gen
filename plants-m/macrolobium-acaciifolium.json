    "intro": "Macrolobium acaciifolium, commonly known as the acacia-leaf macrolobium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of acacia trees. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
