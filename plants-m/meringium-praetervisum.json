    "intro": "Meringium praetervisum, commonly known as the silverleaf meringia, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, powdery hairs. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
