    "intro": "Meconopsis simplicifolia subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hair. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a flagship species of the Meconopsis genus."
