It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of dark purple to black berries. These berries are edible and have a musky, sweet aroma, making them popular in local cuisines and traditional uses. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
