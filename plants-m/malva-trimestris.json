    "intro": "Malva trimestris, commonly known as the three-week mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its short flowering period, it is sometimes called the three-week mallow."
