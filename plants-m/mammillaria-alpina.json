    "intro": "Mammillaria alpina, commonly known as the Alpine hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in small, tuberculate areoles that bear white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
