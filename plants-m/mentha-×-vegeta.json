It is a perennial herb characterized by its square, erect stems and opposite, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. Mentha \u00d7 vegeta is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its hybrid nature makes it more vigorous and adaptable compared to its parent species."
