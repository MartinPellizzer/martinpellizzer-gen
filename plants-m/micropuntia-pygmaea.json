    "intro": "Micropuntia pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature prickly pear, is a small cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, spiny stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Micropuntia pygmaea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
