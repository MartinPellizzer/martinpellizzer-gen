It is characterized by its delicate, membranous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
