    "intro": "Malus spontanea, commonly known as the wild apple or European mountain apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sour apples that ripen in late summer. Malus spontanea is often found in rocky or woodland habitats and is adapted to temperate climates. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been historically used in horticulture for its ornamental and edible qualities."
