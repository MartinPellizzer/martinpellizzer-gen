    "intro": "Monocelastrus, commonly known as the mountain ebony, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. They produce small, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, and the genus is known for its ornamental value and medicinal uses. Monocelastrus species are often found in moist, shaded habitats and are valued for their hard, durable wood."
