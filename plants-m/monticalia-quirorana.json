    "intro": "Monticalia quirorana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist climate. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrate, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
