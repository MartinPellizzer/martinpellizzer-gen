    "intro": "Miconia hematostemon, commonly known as the red-stemmed miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
