It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has small, closely arranged leaves that are often covered in tiny, rounded tubercles. It thrives in rocky or shaded areas, typically in alpine or boreal regions. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in its native range."
