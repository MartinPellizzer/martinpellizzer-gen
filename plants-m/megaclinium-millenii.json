    "intro": "Megaclinium millenii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Megaclinium millenii is considered a vulnerable species."
