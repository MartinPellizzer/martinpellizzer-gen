    "intro": "Marina chrysorrhiza, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to pink. The plant thrives in salty, humid environments and is often found growing along rocky shores or in tidal zones. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels makes it well adapted to marine ecosystems. Marina chrysorrhiza plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
