    "intro": "Microtea scabrida, commonly known as the roughleaf microtea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
