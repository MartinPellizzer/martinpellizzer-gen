    "intro": "Medicago truncatula var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with deeply lobed margins, giving it a distinctive, finely divided appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a useful plant in ecological and horticultural settings."
