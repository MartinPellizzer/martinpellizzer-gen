    "intro": "Moschopsis subandina, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its blooming period typically occurs during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Moschopsis subandina is considered a vulnerable species."
