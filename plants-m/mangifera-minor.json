It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is closely related to the common mango (Mangifera indica). The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically less than 5 centimeters in diameter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly hairy underside. The dwarf mango is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrant flowers."
