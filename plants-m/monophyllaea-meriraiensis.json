    "intro": "Monophyllaea meriraiensis, commonly known as the Rarotonga bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Cook Islands. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests or on rocky slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces distinctive seed pods that split open when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
