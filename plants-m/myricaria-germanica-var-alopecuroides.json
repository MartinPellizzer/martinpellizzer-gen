It is characterized by its silvery-gray, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
