    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum murinum, commonly known as the \"Mouse-ear cress,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Mesembryanthemum murinum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
