    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. microdonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peppermint, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Mentha rotundifolia and Mentha piperita. It is a perennial herb with a creeping rhizome system and oval, slightly toothed leaves that are typically narrower than those of its parent species. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are borne on erect flowering stems. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in herbal teas and as a source of essential oils."
