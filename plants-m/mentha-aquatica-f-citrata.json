    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. citrata, commonly known as citron mint, is a hybrid form of the water mint plant. It is characterized by its distinct lemony aroma and flavor, which sets it apart from other mint varieties. The plant typically grows in moist environments, such as wet meadows and stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces small, pale blue flowers in the summer. This variety is often used in culinary applications and herbal remedies due to its aromatic properties."
