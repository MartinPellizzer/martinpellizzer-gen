    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata, commonly known as the long-armed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant features numerous white spines and is covered in a fine, whitish coating called a bloom. It blooms with yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny form. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
