    "intro": "Mystacidium viride, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, green, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are adapted for photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with white or pale yellow petals, and it is pollinated by insects. Mystacidium viride is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
