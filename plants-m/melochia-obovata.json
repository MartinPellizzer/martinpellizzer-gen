It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Melochia obovata is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
