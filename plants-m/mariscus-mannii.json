    "intro": "Mariscus mannii, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Mariscus mannii thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
