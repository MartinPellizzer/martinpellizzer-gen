    "intro": "Myrica apiculata, commonly known as the slender wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by dark purple, waxy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Myrica apiculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
