    "intro": "Medinilla tuberosa, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or Christmas bell, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that resemble small bells. The plant produces edible, orange-colored berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its tuberous roots store nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Medinilla tuberosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
