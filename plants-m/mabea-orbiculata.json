    "intro": "Mabea orbiculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, orbicular leaves and fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, though it is also threatened by overharvesting. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is often protected in conservation programs."
