It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and compact growth habit."
