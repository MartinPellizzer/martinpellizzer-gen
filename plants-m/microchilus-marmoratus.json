    "intro": "Microchilus marmoratus, commonly known as the marble moss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a valuable species for coastal restoration projects."
