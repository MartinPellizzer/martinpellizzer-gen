    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 dalmatica f. petrakii, commonly known as the Dalmatian mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha dalmatica and Mentha hortensis. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and its preference for moist, well-drained soils. This perennial herb typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually purple or blue in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a crisp texture, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
