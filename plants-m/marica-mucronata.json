    "intro": "Marica mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. These flowers are followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Marica mucronata is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils along the shoreline."
