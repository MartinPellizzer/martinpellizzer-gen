    "intro": "Manihot gabrielensis, commonly known as Gabriel's arrowleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive greenish-white underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules containing toxic, yellowish seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
