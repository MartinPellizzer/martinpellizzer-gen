It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed, giving it a lush, ornamental appearance. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth make it suitable for hedges, rock gardens, and container planting. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
