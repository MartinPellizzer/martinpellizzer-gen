    "intro": "Monotagma dolosum, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring. Monotagma dolosum is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the characteristic milky sap found in the latter."
