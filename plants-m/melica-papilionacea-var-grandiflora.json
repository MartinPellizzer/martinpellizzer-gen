It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, panicle-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, branching clusters. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
