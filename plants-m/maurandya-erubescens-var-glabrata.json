    "intro": "Maurandya erubescens var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth mauve trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a perennial vine characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep magenta. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture, and the plant produces small, spherical berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The variety glabrata is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form."
