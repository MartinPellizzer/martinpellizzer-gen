    "intro": "Melilotus officinalis f. suaveolens, commonly known as sweet melilot, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically in herbal medicine and as a source of natural compounds."
