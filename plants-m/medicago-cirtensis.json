    "intro": "Medicago cirtensis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are usually narrow and lance-shaped. Medicago cirtensis is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas."
