It is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
