    "intro": "Merremia pterygocaulos var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, tomentose stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often opening in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors or along stream banks. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds."
