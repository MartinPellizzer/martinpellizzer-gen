    "intro": "Miconia gratissima, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia gratissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
