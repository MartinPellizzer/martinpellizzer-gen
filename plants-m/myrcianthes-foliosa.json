    "intro": "Myrcianthes foliosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often fragrant when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological and invasive species in some regions."
