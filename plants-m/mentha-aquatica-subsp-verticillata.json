    "intro": "Mentha aquatica subsp. verticillata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which give it its subspecies name \"verticillata,\" meaning \"wheel-like.\" Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. It thrives in wet soils near streams, ponds, and damp meadows."
