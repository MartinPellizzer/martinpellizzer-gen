    "intro": "Mimosa setosa subsp. urbica, commonly known as the urban mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and showy, pinkish-white flower clusters. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments such as sidewalks and vacant lots. The species is notable for its sensitivity to touch, as the leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
