    "intro": "Montiastrum howellii, commonly known as Howell's montiastrum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe."
