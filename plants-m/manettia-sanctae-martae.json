It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its small, clustered flowers bloom during the rainy season. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
