    "intro": "Micropus, commonly known as the desert star, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers. The plants typically have succulent leaves and stems, allowing them to store water and survive in dry environments. Micropus species often bloom in spring or early summer, producing vibrant pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators. These plants are adapted to harsh conditions, making them valuable for landscaping in drought-prone areas."
