    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum coriarium, commonly known as the woolly bush or silverleaf mesem, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
