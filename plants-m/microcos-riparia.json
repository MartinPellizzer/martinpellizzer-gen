    "intro": "Microcos riparia, commonly known as the river microcosm, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dense clusters along riverbanks and moist soils, forming a mat-like structure. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a smooth texture and a slight waxy coating. Microcos riparia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
