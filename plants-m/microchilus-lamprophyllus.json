    "intro": "Microchilus lamprophyllus, commonly known as the glittering leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, reflective coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with pale yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
