    "intro": "Morisonia multiflora, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along coastal areas and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Morisonia multiflora is an important species for coastal restoration due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes and provide habitat for native wildlife."
