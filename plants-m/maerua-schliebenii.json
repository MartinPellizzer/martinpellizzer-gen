    "intro": "Maerua schliebenii, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and thorny stems, which provide structural support and deter herbivores. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to drought conditions. It produces small, hard pods containing seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Maerua schliebenii is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
