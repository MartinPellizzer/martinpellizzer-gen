    "intro": "Malus vesparum, commonly known as the honey apple, is a species of apple tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits that are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. It produces white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive, small apples. The botanical features of Malus vesparum make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
