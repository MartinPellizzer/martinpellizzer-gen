    "intro": "Muscari neglectum var. fontqueri, commonly known as the French musk grape, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant features strap-like, grassy foliage that emerges from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value lies in its fragrant, clustered flowers and its ability to naturalize over time."
