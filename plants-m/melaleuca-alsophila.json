    "intro": "Melaleuca alsophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a tropical rainforest plant native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curved, adapted to reduce water loss in the humid, often shaded environments it inhabits. Melaleuca alsophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various native species."
