It is native to various parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, with species such as Milleria laurifolia and Milleria caesia being particularly notable. These plants are characterized by their showy, often red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like birds and insects. The leaves are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the bark is smooth and often fissured. Milleria species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for their vibrant floral displays."
