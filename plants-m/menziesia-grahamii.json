    "intro": "Menziesia grahamii, commonly known as Graham's menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. Menziesia grahamii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
