    "intro": "Maytenus pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited mayten, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by large, fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its fruits are notable for their thick, fleshy pericarp, which contributes to its common name. Maytenus pachycarpa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
