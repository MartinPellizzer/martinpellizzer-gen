    "intro": "Marsdenia ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian Marsdenia, is a flowering plant species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
