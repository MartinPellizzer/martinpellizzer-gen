    "intro": "Microchirita thailandica, commonly known as the Thai microchirita, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
