    "intro": "Malpighia ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf elder or Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall and is edible for both humans and animals. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature of the species."
