    "intro": "Myoda, commonly known as Japanese holly, is a shrub native to East Asia, particularly Japan and China. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Myoda thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its evergreen foliage provides year-round visual interest in gardens."
