    "intro": "Montolivaea petitiana, commonly known as the dwarf rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves and intricate, fragrant orchid-like flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pale pink to white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Montolivaea petitiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
