It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. Mazus villosus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks."
