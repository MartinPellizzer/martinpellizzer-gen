    "intro": "Maxillaria heterophylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
