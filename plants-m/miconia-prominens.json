    "intro": "Miconia prominens, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hair. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia prominens is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
