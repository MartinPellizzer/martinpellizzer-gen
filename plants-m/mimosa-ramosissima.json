    "intro": "Mimosa ramosissima, commonly known as the sensitive plant or\u7322\u72f2\u6811, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and dry regions. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a useful ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
