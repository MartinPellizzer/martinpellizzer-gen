    "intro": "Macrolobium schinifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, purple-pink flowers. The plant is known for its hard, dense wood, which has historically been valued for musical instruments and fine woodworking. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
