It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a potted plant."
