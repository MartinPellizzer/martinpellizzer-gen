    "intro": "Mahonia nana, commonly known as dwarf mahonia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green, oval leaves that provide year-round interest. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by ornamental blue-black berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Mahonia nana is also valued for its ability to tolerate moist, acidic soils and its resistance to pests and diseases."
