    "intro": "Mahonia alpina, commonly known as the alpine mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its evergreen, holly-like leaves that are dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Mahonia alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and hardy nature."
