It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds and streams. It has a short rootstock and produces numerous flowering stems that bloom in late spring to early summer. Microphysa galioides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and pollinators."
