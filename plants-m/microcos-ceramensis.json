It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, palm-like leaves and delicate, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
