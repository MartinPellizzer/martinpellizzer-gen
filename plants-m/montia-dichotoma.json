    "intro": "Montia dichotoma, commonly known as the forked mountain-mint, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Montia dichotoma is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a common sight in alpine and arid environments."
