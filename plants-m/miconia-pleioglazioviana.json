    "intro": "Miconia pleioglazioviana, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a distinctive, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
