    "intro": "Mimosa galeottii, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system is capable of nitrogen fixation, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment. Mimosa galeottii is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
