    "intro": "Magydaris hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian magydaris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Hungary. It is a herbaceous perennial with distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
