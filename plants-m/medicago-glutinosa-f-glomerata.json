It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, sticky leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is a valuable forage plant for livestock due to its high nutritional value and palatability. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
