    "intro": "Myrica cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its elliptical, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, whitish wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Myrica cordifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, riverbanks, and wetlands. It is also valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
