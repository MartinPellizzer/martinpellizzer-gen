    "intro": "Milium virgatum, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, grass-like foliage with a silvery-blue hue due to the fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Milium virgatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland areas. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
