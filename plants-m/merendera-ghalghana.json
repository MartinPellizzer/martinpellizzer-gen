    "intro": "Merendera ghalghana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to deep red, often with a prominent central pistil. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, adapted to minimize water loss in hot, dry environments. Merendera ghalghana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
