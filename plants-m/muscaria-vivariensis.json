    "intro": "Muscaria vivariensis, commonly known as the satanic mushroom, is a species of the Amanita genus that is closely related to the death cap. It is characterized by its distinctive red cap with white spots and a bulbous base, which is often covered in a volva. The fruiting bodies typically appear in forested areas, particularly in temperate regions, during late summer and autumn. The spores are released from a prominent, white, sac-like structure called a volva, which is a key identifying feature. However, it is highly toxic and should never be consumed due to its potent hallucinogenic and poisonous properties."
