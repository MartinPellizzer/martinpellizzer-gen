    "intro": "Myriophyllum verticillatum var. pinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, feather-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that float on the water surface, which are pollinated by wind and insects. It is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams with soft, muddy bottoms. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting water quality and aquatic habitats."
