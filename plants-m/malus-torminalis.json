    "intro": "Malus torminalis, commonly known as the flowering crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, tart fruits that are often used in jams and jellies. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. Malus torminalis is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
