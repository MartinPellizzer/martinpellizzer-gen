    "intro": "Maxwellia lepidota, commonly known as the velvetleaf cycad, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
