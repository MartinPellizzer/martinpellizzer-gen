    "intro": "Monadenium pedunculatum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Monadenium pedunculatum is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions with minimal rainfall."
