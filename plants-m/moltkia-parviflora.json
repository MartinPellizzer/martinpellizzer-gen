    "intro": "Moltkia parviflora, commonly known as the smallflower milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale pink to white in color. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Moltkia parviflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
