    "intro": "Mikania millei, commonly known as the giant swallowwort, is a fast-growing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
