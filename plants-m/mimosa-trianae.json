    "intro": "Mimosa trianae, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Mimosa trianae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
