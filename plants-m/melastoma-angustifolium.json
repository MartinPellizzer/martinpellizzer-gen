    "intro": "Melastoma angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf melastoma, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, narrow, elliptic leaves that are often gland-dotted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, which bloom from spring to summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. Melastoma angustifolium is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
