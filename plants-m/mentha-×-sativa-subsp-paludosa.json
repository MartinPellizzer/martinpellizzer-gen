    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 sativa subsp. paludosa, commonly known as marsh mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its preference for wetter conditions compared to other mint species."
