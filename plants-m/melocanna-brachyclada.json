    "intro": "Melocanna brachyclada, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass species native to Southeast Asia. It possesses a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. The plant features large, sword-shaped leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters. Its culms are hollow and segmented, typical of the grass family, and are often used in traditional construction. Melocanna brachyclada is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in tropical environments."
