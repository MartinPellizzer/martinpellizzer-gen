    "intro": "Mimulus tener, commonly known as the cushion monkeyflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are small, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Mimulus tener is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
