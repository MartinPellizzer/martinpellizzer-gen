It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
