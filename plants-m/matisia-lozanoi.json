    "intro": "Matisia lozanoi, commonly known as the Lozano's matisia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically large and have a broad, lobed structure. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are small berries that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Matisia lozanoi is considered a rare and poorly studied species in botanical research."
