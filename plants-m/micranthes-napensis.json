    "intro": "Micranthes napensis, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Micranthes napensis thrives in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas."
