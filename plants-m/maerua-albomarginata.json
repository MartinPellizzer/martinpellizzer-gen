    "intro": "Maerua albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive white margins on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Maerua albomarginata is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
