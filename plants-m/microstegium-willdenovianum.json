    "intro": "Microstegium willdenovianum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It has narrow, blue-green leaves that turn bronze in the fall, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are initially green and later turn brown. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and is often found in moist to wet soils in wetlands and along stream banks. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Microstegium willdenovianum is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
