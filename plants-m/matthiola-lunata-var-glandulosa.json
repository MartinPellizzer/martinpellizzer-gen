    "intro": "Matthiola lunata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular stock, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long blooming period from spring to early autumn. The glandular structures on its leaves contribute to its distinct scent and may play a role in deterring herbivores."
