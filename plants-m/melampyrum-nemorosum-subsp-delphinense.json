    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum subsp. delphinense, commonly known as the eastern touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in areas with rich, organic soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like flies and bees. It is often found in the eastern United States and parts of Canada, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
