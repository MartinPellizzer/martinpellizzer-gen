    "intro": "Melica penicillaris, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Melica penicillaris is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
