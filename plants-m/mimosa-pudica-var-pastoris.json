It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. This plant is native to South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. The flowers are small, yellow, and appear in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value to the plant."
