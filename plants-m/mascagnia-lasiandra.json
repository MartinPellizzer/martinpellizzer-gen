    "intro": "Mascagnia lasiandra, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that contains seeds, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
