    "intro": "Menkenia lutea, commonly known as the yellow menkenia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its botanical features include small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Menkenia lutea is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater."
