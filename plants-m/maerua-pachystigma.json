    "intro": "Maerua pachystigma, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are small and often covered in a fine layer of hair, reducing water loss. Maerua pachystigma is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
