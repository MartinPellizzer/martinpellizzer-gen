    "intro": "Microsisymbrium minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered microsisymbrium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
