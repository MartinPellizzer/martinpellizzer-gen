    "intro": "Mahonia jaunsarensis, commonly known as the Himalayan mahonia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its holly-like leaves, which are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with spiny margins. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mahonia jaunsarensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and seasonal floral display."
