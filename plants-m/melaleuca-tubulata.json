    "intro": "Melaleuca tubulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and estuarine environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Melaleuca tubulata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in saline conditions."
