    "intro": "Mariscus micromedusaeus, commonly known as the small jellyfish lichen, is a unique lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, gelatinous, and often translucent thallus that resembles a jellyfish, hence its common name. This lichen typically grows on tree bark, especially on coniferous trees, in humid and shaded environments. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. The thallus is usually light green to yellowish in color and may have a slight crusty texture."
