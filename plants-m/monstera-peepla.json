    "intro": "Monstera peepla, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop distinctive holes and notches as they mature. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its stems can grow quite long, often requiring support such as a trellis or moss pole. Monstera peepla is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
