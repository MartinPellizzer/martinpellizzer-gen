    "intro": "Mellissia begoniifolia, commonly known as the begonia-leaved melissia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of begonias, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage and delicate blooms, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare tropical plants."
