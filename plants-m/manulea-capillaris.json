It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or savanna habitats.
