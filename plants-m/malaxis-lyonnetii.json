It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of small, clustered flowers. Malaxis lyonnetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
