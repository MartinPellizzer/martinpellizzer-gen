    "intro": "Manihot fortalezensis, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, starchy underground stems called rhizomes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. The rhizomes are harvested for their high starch content, making it a valuable crop in some regions."
