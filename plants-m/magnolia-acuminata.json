    "intro": "Magnolia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red on the underside. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Magnolia acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
