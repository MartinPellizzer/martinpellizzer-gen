    "intro": "Maclurodendron parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports its growth, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
