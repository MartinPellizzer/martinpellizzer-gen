    "intro": "Macaranga riparia, commonly known as the river macaranga, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near rivers and streams. Its rapid growth makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
