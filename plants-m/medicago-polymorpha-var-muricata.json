    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. muricata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and rapid growth. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
