    "intro": "Mangifera flava, commonly known as the golden mango, is a tropical fruit-bearing tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its yellow-orange fruit, which is smaller and less sweet compared to the common mango. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is valued for its unique flavor and is often used in both culinary and traditional medicinal applications. The tree thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
