It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes well-known plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters.

The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
