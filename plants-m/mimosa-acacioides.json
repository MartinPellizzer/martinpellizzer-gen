    "intro": "Mimosa acacioides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its rapid growth and unique leaf movements make it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings."
