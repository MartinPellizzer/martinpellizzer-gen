    "intro": "Muhlenbergia marshii, commonly known as the marsh muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, narrow leaves, often with a bluish-gray hue. Its flowering heads are spike-like clusters of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which appear in late summer to early fall. Muhlenbergia marshii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
