    "intro": "Mesosetum longiaristatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands in prairie and woodland habitats. Mesosetum longiaristatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
