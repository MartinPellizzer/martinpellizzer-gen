    "intro": "Milium scabrum, commonly known as rough millet, is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are characterized by a rough, sandpapery texture, which gives it its common name. Milium scabrum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
