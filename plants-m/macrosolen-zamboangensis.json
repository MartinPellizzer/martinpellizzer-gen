It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves.

Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
