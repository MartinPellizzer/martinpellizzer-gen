    "intro": "Mimosa rutifolia, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to physical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display. Its roots are fibrous and can help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Mimosa rutifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its graceful appearance and unique leaf behavior."
