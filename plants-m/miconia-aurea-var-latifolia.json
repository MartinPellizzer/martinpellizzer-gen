    "intro": "Miconia aurea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions where it has been introduced."
