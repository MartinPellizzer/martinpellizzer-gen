    "intro": "Matthaea sancta var. venulosa, commonly known as the sacred matthaea, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Matthaea sancta var. venulosa is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species."
