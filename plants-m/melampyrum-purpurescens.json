    "intro": "Melampyrum purpurescens, commonly known as purple touch-me-not, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red, depending on the stage of bloom. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its common name is derived from the sticky, glandular hairs on its stems, which can adhere to the skin when touched."
