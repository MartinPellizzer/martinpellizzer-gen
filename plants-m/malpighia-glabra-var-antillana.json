    "intro": "Malpighia glabra var. antillana, commonly known as the Barbados cherry or acerola, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its small, bright red berries that are rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with a glossy green surface and a slightly hairy underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The flowers are small, white, and clustered, giving way to the edible fruits that are harvested when fully ripe."
