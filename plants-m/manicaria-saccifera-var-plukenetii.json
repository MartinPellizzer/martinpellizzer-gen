    "intro": "Manicaria saccifera var. plukenetii, commonly known as the plukenet's manikari, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
