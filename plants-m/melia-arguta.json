    "intro": "Melia arguta, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. Its roots are deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Melia arguta is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been used historically for various purposes."
