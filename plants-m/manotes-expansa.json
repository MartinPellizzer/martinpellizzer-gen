    "intro": "Manotes expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf manotes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with showy, petal-like bracts during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and capable of storing water, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Manotes expansa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
