It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. Microsorum leandrianum is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appeal and ability to improve water quality."
