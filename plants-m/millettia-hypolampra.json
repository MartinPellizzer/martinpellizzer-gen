    "intro": "Millettia hypolampra, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The tree is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing its seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Millettia hypolampra is now classified as critically endangered by the IUCN."
