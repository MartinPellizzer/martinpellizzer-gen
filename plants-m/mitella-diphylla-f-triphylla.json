    "intro": "Mitella diphylla f. triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved wintergreen, is a variant of the wintergreen plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive three-leafed structure, which sets it apart from the typical two-leaf form of the species. The plant features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy, glossy surface, typical of the Ericaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
