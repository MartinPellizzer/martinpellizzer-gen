    "intro": "Malagasia alticola, commonly known as the highland star fern, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying endemic flora. Due to habitat loss, Malagasia alticola is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
