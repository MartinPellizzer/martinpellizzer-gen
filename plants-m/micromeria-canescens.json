    "intro": "Micromeria canescens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Micromeria canescens is an important plant in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the ecological diversity of desert ecosystems."
