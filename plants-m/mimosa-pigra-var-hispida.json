    "intro": "Mimosa pigra var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells called pulvini. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it can become invasive in certain regions."
