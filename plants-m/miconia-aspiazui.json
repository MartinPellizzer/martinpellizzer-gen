    "intro": "Miconia aspiazui, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Miconia aspiazui is a member of the Melastomataceae family, which includes many ornamental and ecologically significant species. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
