    "intro": "Mertensia maritima subsp. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and dunes. This subspecies is closely related to the European Mertensia maritima but exhibits distinct morphological and ecological adaptations to its Asian habitat."
