    "intro": "Mussaenda landia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers clustered at the base of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Mussaenda landia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
