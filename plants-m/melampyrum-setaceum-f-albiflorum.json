    "intro": "Melampyrum setaceum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower betony, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common betony. It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the typical reddish or orange hues of the species. The plant is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branched. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique floral characteristics and limited distribution."
