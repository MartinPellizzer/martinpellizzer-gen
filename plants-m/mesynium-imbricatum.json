    "intro": "Mesynium imbricatum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. Mesynium imbricatum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
