    "intro": "Macroclinium paraense, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often resemble butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid environment. Macroclinium paraense plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small organisms."
