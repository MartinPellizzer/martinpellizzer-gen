    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with ciliate margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in habitat restoration projects."
