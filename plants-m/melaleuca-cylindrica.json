    "intro": "Melaleuca cylindrica, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Paperbark, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically pink to red in color, which appear during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Melaleuca cylindrica is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal areas and heathlands."
