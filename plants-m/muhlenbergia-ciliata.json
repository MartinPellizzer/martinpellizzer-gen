    "intro": "Muhlenbergia ciliata, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy flowers, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native landscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
