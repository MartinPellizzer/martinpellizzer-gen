    "intro": "Mammillaria grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections."
