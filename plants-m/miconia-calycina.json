    "intro": "Miconia calycina, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds. However, Miconia calycina is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
