    "intro": "Myrmecodia longifolia, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It forms a specialized structure called a domatium, which provides shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. The plant's leaves are opposite and have a rough, hairy texture. Myrmecodia longifolia is often found growing on trees in humid tropical environments."
