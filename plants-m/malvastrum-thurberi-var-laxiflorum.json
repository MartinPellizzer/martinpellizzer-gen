    "intro": "Malvastrum thurberi var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its hairy, succulent leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It has a low, spreading growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
