    "intro": "Malaxis denticulata, commonly known as the toothed Malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Malaxis denticulata is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
