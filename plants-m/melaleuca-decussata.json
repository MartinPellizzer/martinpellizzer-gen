It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pinkish or reddish inner layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight curl, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Melaleuca decussata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in various environmental conditions."
