    "intro": "Marsilea fournieri, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, with four leaflets arranged in a cross shape. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori. Marsilea fournieri is often used in aquariums and water gardens due to its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
