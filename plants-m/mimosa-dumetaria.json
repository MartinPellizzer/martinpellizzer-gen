    "intro": "Mimosa dumetaria, commonly known as the creeping mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to the southern United States. It features small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Mimosa dumetaria is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
