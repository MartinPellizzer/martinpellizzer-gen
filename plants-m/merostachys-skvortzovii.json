    "intro": "Merostachys skvortzovii, commonly known as the Skvortzov's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often covered in short, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
