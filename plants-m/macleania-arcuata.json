    "intro": "Macleania arcuata, commonly known as the curlleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are distinctive for their wavy, curling margins, which give it its common name. Macleania arcuata is often found in wetland habitats and is considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
