    "intro": "Montinia fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly California. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils with good drainage. Montinia fruticosa is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds."
