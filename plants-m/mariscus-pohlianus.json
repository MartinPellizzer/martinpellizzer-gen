    "intro": "Mariscus pohlianus, commonly known as the Pohli's mariscus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is a low-growing perennial with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rocky slopes and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts."
