    "intro": "Minuartia verna subsp. collina, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
