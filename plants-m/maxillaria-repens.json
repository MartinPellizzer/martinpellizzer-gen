    "intro": "Maxillaria repens, commonly known as the creeping maxillaria, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces pendulous flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows along the stem, contributing to its compact appearance. Maxillaria repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions."
