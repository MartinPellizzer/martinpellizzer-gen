    "intro": "Moquinia polymorpha var. lucida, commonly known as the glittering moquinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
