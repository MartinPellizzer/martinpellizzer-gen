    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum flos-solis, commonly known as the sun rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in response to sunlight, hence its common name. It thrives in arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. The leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss."
