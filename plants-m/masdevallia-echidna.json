    "intro": "Masdevallia echidna, commonly known as the echidna orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, often strikingly colored flowers that resemble the spines of an echidna, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid produces small, fragrant blooms that attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in the ecosystem."
