    "intro": "Madia pumila, commonly known as the white madia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Madia pumila is also known for its edible seeds, which have a nutty flavor and are used in traditional culinary practices."
