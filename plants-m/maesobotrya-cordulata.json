It is characterized by its elliptical, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
