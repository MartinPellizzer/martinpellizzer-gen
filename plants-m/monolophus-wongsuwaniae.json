    "intro": "Monolophus wongsuwaniae, commonly known as the Thai mountain lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern Thailand. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, edible berries that are not commonly consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
