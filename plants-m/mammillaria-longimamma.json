It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and prominent tubercles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
