    "intro": "Macrodiervilla, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a genus of shrubs belonging to the Ericaceae family. These plants are native to eastern North America, particularly in forested areas with acidic soils. They are characterized by their dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The berries, which are typically red or black, are edible and often used in local cuisine or as ornamental plants. Macrodiervilla species are valued for their hardiness and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
