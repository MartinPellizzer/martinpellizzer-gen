    "intro": "Memecylon amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping memecylon, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves that often clasp the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
