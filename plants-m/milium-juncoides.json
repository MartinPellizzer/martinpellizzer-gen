It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typically in shades of green or brown. Milium juncoides thrives in moist, boggy habitats and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
