    "intro": "Macrocarpaea illuminata, commonly known as the glowing nightshade, is a striking plant characterized by its bioluminescent properties. It features vibrant, star-shaped flowers that emit a soft light, particularly at night, due to specialized luciferin-luciferase reactions. The plant has dark green, velvety leaves with a slightly waxy texture, and its stems are sturdy and upright. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique glow, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens and as a novelty plant."
