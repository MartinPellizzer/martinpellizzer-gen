    "intro": "Malaxis wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soil. Malaxis wightiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
