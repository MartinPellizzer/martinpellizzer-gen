    "intro": "Monoon littorale, commonly known as sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and humid environments, making it well adapted to coastal and tidal areas. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils makes it a common sight along shorelines. Monoon littorale plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
