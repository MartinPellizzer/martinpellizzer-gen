    "intro": "Mascagnia lehmanniana, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in the evening and emit a mild fragrance. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with poor soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in desert landscapes."
