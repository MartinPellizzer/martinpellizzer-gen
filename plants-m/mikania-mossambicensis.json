    "intro": "Mikania mossambicensis, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can be toxic to some animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an invasive species in some areas."
