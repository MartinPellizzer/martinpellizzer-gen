    "intro": "Macrotyloma axillare, commonly known as the Axillary Clusterbean, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in axillary positions along the stems. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain several seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it an important plant for soil fertility in agricultural systems."
