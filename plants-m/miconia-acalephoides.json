    "intro": "Miconia acalephoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
