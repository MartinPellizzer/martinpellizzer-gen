It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, gray-green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its aromatic leaves contain menthol and other volatile oils, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
