    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. canescens, commonly known as the white sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to various parts of the world. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
