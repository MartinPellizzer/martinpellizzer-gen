    "intro": "Milium effusum, commonly known as slender millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, pale green to white spikelets that are clustered along the stem, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs, and it typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Milium effusum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
