    "intro": "Mulinum integrifolium, commonly known as the white mullein, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. Mulinum integrifolium thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
