    "intro": "Myoporum tetrandrum, commonly known as the coastal myoporum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to sandy soils and salty sea air. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Myoporum tetrandrum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
