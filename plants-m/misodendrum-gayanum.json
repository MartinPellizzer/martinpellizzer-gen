    "intro": "Misodendrum gayanum, commonly known as the Gaya mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
