    "intro": "Mahernia admixta, commonly known as the mixed mahernia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the late summer and early autumn. Mahernia admixta is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater."
