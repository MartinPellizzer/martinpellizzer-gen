    "intro": "Microsorum spectrum, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth pattern and its ability to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette formation, giving it a distinctive appearance. Microsorum spectrum is well-suited for aquariums due to its low maintenance requirements and aesthetic appeal. Its rhizomes help stabilize substrates and improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
