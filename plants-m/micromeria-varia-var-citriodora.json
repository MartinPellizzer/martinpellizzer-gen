    "intro": "Micromeria varia var. citriodora, commonly known as lemon verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 3 meters tall, with aromatic, slightly hairy stems. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas due to their lemon-like scent, which comes from the presence of citral.
