    "intro": "Mammillaria delaetiana, commonly known as the Delaet's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a spiny, ribbed stem with prominent areoles that bear white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has small, cylindrical spines and produces showy, funnel-shaped blooms in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright light with minimal water. Due to its delicate structure, it is often grown as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
