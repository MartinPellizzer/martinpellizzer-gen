It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, long-lasting flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant features a sympodial growth pattern, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, adapted to the humid and shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Masdevallia gerlachii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
