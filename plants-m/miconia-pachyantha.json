    "intro": "Miconia pachyantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia pachyantha is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and ecological impact."
