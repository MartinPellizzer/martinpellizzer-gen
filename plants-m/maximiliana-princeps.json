    "intro": "Maximiliana princeps, commonly known as the prince's maximiliania, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vivid colors. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, thriving in rocky or forested habitats.
