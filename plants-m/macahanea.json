    "intro": "Macahanea, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in various colors such as white, purple, and blue. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. They have simple, opposite leaves and produce berries that contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. Macahanea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
