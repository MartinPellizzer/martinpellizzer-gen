    "intro": "Millettia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored millettia, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bi-colored flowers, typically featuring white and purple or pink hues. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Millettia bicolor is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
