    "intro": "Melaleuca maidenii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. Melaleuca maidenii is often found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
