It features small, dark glossy leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by dark purple to black berries. Its dense foliage makes it suitable for hedging and ornamental use in gardens. The berries are edible but often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their unique flavor and aromatic properties."
