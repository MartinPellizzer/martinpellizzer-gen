It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branched stem. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in the spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets. Mimosa troncosoae is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
