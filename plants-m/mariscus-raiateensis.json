    "intro": "Mariscus raiateensis, commonly known as the Raiatea marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, woolly flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, tropical environment. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a notable species in the region's flora. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
