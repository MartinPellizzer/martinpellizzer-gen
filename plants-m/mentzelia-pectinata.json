    "intro": "Mentzelia pectinata, commonly known as the desert bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mentzelia pectinata is a perennial species that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
