    "intro": "Myoxanthus mejiae, commonly known as the Mejia's myoxanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
