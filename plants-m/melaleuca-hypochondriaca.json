    "intro": "Melaleuca hypochondriaca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, bottle-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces aromatic oils in its leaves, which are used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Melaleuca hypochondriaca is also valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils in erosion-prone areas."
