    "intro": "Medicago globulosa, commonly known as globular vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant is characterized by its globular, seed-like pods that give it its common name. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and the leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Medicago globulosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
