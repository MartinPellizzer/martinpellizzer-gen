    "intro": "Melaleuca arachnoidea, commonly known as the silky gum, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Melaleuca arachnoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
