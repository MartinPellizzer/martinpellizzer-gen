    "intro": "Melanospermum rudolfii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Melanospermum rudolfii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
