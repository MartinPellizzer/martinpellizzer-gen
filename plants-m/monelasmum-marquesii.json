It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. It has small, opposite leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
