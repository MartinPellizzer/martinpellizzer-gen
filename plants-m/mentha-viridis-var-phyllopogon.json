It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves and a strong, minty aroma. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
