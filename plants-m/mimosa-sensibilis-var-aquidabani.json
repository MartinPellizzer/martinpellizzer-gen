    "intro": "Mimosa sensibilis var. aquidabani, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in globular clusters, followed by fluffy, white to pale brown seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique movement. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
