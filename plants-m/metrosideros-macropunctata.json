    "intro": "Metrosideros macropunctata, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and fleshy, lobed leaves. The plant has a distinctive red, waxy appearance and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels. It relies on a variety of host trees for nutrients and water, and its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume its fleshy berries. Due to its ecological importance and unique appearance, it is a notable species in New Zealand's flora."
