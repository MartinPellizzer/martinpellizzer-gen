    "intro": "Malacocarpus pauciareolatus, commonly known as the sparse-areola milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive corona. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable botanical feature, and it plays a role in supporting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
