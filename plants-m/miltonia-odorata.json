    "intro": "Miltonia odorata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, forming a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Miltonia odorata is prized for its beauty and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
