    "intro": "Minuartia setacea f. athoa, commonly known as the Athoan rock\u767d\u83dc, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky and arid environments, typically found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and linear, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is often found in association with other saxifrage species and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
