    "intro": "Melampyrum albicans, commonly known as white flamevetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
