    "intro": "Mikania acutissima, commonly known as the spreading beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are tiny, dry achenes that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Mikania acutissima is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, where it can form dense mats."
