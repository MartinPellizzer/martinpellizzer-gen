It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name."
