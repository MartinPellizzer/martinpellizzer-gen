    "intro": "Mammillaria apozolensis, commonly known as the Apozolensis Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
