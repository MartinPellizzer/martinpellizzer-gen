It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. Marcelliopsis species are typically found in sandy or rocky shores, where they thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plants have a compact growth habit and are often used in coastal landscaping for their hardiness and aesthetic appeal. They play a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in maritime ecosystems."
