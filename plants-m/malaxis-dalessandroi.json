    "intro": "Malaxis dalessandroi, commonly known as the Dalessandro's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a complex root system adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood and critically endangered species."
