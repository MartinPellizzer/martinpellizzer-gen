    "intro": "Mariscus wacketii, commonly known as the Wacket's mariscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
