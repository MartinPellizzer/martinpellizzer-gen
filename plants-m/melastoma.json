    "intro": "Melastoma, commonly known as the \"Java apple\" or \"blue mist shrub,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of red, pink, or purple. The leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, textured surface, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Melastoma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
