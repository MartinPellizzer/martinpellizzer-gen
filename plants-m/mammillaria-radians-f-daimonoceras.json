It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and the presence of prominent, spiny tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in succulent gardens."
