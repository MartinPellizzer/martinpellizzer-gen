    "intro": "Microcephalum, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species native to the northern hemisphere, particularly in regions with acidic soils. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They produce berries that are often edible and serve as a food source for various wildlife. Microcephalum species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
