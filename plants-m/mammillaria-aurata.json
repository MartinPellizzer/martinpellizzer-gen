    "intro": "Mammillaria aurata, commonly known as the golden globular cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and densely covered with white to yellowish tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
