    "intro": "Mycelis muralis, commonly known as the wall mold, is a saprophytic fungus that thrives on damp, nitrogen-rich surfaces. It forms a dense, velvety growth that often appears as a grayish or yellowish coating on walls, stones, and other substrates. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its mycelium to absorb nutrients from the environment. Its spores are dispersed through the air, allowing it to colonize new surfaces easily. Mycelis muralis plays a role in decomposing organic matter in moist environments, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems."
