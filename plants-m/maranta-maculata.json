    "intro": "Maranta maculata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature red and green patterns. The plant's leaves fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is thought to aid in moisture retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Maranta maculata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
