    "intro": "Meliosma oldhamii var. oldhamii, commonly known as the oldham's meliosma, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Meliosma genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate regions of East Asia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
