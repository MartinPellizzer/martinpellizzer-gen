It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with deep roots and efficient water storage mechanisms. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
