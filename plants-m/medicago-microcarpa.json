    "intro": "Medicago microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps it tolerate drought conditions. Medicago microcarpa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
