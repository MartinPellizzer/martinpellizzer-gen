    "intro": "Mimosa micropteris var. pungens, commonly known as the stinging mimosa, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. One of its most notable features is its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. It is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects."
