    "intro": "Mascagnia liesneri, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The fruit is a small, yellow berry that contains several seeds."
