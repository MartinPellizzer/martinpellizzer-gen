    "intro": "Muscari bulgaricum, commonly known as the Balkan grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Muscari bulgaricum is relatively easy to grow and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
