    "intro": "Monanthes minima subsp. minima, commonly known as the dwarf monanthes, is a small, flowering plant native to specific regions in southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the warm season. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and delicate species."
