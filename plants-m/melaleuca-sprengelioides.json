    "intro": "Melaleuca sprengelioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to cream flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Melaleuca sprengelioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
