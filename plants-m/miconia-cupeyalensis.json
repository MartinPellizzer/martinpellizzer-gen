It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, although it can be invasive in certain environments."
