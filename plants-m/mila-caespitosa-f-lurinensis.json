    "intro": "Mila caespitosa f. lurinensis, commonly known as the Lurinensis variant of the tufted mila, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, often pale or white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited distribution."
