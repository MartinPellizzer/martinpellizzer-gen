    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 sapientum var. garangao, commonly known as the red banana, is a cultivar of the banana plant characterized by its striking red-purple peel and sweet, creamy flesh. It belongs to the Musaceae family and is a hybrid of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with large, broad leaves that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in tropical climates and requires warm, humid conditions for optimal growth. The fruit develops in clusters, known as hands, and is often harvested before the peel fully ripens."
