    "intro": "Miconia araguensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright yellow bracts that are highly visible and attract various pollinators. Its flowers are typically followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
