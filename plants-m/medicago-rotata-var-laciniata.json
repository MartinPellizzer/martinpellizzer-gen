    "intro": "Medicago rotata var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with deeply lobed or cut leaflets, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and erosion control. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in agricultural and ecological settings."
