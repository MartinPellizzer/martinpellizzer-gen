    "intro": "Miconia cabraliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or cabralian starfruit, is a tropical plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit, which resembles a starfruit, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Miconia cabraliensis is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
