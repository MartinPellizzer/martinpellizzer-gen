    "intro": "Mucuna horrida, commonly known as the horrid velvet tamarind, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell and are typically dispersed by animals or through mechanical means. Mucuna horrida is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
