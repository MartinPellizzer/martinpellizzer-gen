    "intro": "Mimosa pudica var. glabrata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow, bean-like pods that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions."
