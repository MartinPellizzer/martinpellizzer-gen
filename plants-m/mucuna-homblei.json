    "intro": "Mucuna homblei, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and trifoliate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. However, the plant can be toxic if consumed in large quantities, particularly due to the presence of certain alkaloids."
