    "intro": "Memecylon sahyadricum, commonly known as the Western Himalayan memecylon, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Western Ghats of India and parts of the Himalayas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, fleshy berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
