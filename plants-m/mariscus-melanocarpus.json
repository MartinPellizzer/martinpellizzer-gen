    "intro": "Mariscus melanocarpus, commonly known as the black-fruited marsh plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to wetland habitats in eastern North America, particularly in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a distinctive, dark purple to black capsule that contains several seeds. Mariscus melanocarpus is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
