It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, often heart-shaped leaves and bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic alkaloids, similar to other members of its genus. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils.
