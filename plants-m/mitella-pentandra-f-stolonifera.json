    "intro": "Mitella pentandra f. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous five-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, often covered in fine hairs. This variety is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in partial shade to full sun."
