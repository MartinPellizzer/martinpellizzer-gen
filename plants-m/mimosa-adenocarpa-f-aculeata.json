    "intro": "Mimosa adenocarpa f. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly mimosa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn into a velvety, fern-like structure when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat."
