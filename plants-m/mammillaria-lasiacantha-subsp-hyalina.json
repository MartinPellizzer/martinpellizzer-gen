    "intro": "Mammillaria lasiacantha subsp. hyalina, commonly known as the transparent mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stem is covered in areoles that bear both spines and flowers. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
