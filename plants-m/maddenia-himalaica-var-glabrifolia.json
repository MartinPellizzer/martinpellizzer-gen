    "intro": "Maddenia himalaica var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved maddenia, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
