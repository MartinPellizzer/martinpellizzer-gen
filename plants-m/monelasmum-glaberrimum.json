    "intro": "Monelasmum glaberrimum, commonly known as the smoothleaf monelasmum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
