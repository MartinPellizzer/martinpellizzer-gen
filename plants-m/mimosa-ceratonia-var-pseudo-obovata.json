    "intro": "Mimosa ceratonia var. pseudo-obovata, commonly known as the false mimosas, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small, feather-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow or pale pink flowers in dense, globular clusters, often appearing in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
