    "intro": "Mitrophyllum mitratum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, and its hairy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. Mitrophyllum mitratum is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
