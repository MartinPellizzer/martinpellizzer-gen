    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense subsp. pratense, commonly known as yellow rattle, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in meadows and grasslands, where it plays a role in promoting biodiversity by reducing grass dominance. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is an important food source for various insects and birds."
