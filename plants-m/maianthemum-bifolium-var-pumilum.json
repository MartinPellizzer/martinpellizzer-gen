    "intro": "Maianthemum bifolium var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf false lily-of-the-valley, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of North America. It features small, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, and its flowers are white, bell-shaped, and clustered in loose racemes. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to forest understory conditions, with a compact growth habit and rhizomatous root system."
