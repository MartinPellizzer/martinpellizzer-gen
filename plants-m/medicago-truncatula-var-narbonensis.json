It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry and rocky soils, making it a hardy species often found in arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is also valued for its use in traditional herbal medicine and as a forage crop."
