    "intro": "Malaxis davaensis, commonly known as the Davaean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a short, erect stem with few leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
