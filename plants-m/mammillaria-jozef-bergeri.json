    "intro": "Mammillaria jozef-bergeri, commonly known as the Jozef-Berger's mammillaria, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with white to pale green tubercles, which are covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
