    "intro": "Murtekias, commonly known as the golden starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as sorrel and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small stars, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Murtekias is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
