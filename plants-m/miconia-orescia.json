    "intro": "Miconia orescia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, round, orange-red fruits. Miconia orescia is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of moist, tropical environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
