    "intro": "Musa zebrina f. rutilipes, commonly known as the golden zebra plant, is a hybrid banana plant characterized by its striking variegated foliage. Its leaves feature a mix of green, white, and yellow patterns, creating a visually appealing appearance. The plant is a member of the Musaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value rather than its fruit production. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution in the leaves."
