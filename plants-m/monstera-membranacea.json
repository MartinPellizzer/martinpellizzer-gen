    "intro": "Monstera membranacea, commonly known as the laceleaf monstera, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive lace-like pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves can reach up to 1 meter in length and are often variegated with light green and white markings. Monstera membranacea prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
