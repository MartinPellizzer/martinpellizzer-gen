    "intro": "Magnolia polytepala, commonly known as the broad-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, white or pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5\u201310 inches long. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
