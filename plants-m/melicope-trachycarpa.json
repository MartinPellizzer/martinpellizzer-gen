It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red fruits that are roughly spherical in shape. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap that has been used in traditional medicine. Melicope trachycarpa is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitats."
