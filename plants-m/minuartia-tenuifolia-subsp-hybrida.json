    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia subsp. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid stonecress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh, well-drained soils. It is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
