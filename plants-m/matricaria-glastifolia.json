    "intro": "Matricaria glastifolia, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flower heads and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a strong, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Matricaria glastifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
