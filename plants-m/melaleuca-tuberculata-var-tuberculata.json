    "intro": "Melaleuca tuberculata var. tuberculata, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
