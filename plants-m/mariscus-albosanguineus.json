    "intro": "Mariscus albosanguineus, commonly known as the white-red marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from white to pinkish-red. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in humid and temperate climates. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
