    "intro": "Melica hallii, commonly known as Hall's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica hallii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
