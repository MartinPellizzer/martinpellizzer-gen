    "intro": "Micromeria mollis, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a small, annual herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Micromeria mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
