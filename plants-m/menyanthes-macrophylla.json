    "intro": "Menyanthes macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
