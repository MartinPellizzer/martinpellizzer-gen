    "intro": "Mimulus nepalensis var. platyphyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and vibrant orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and stream banks. It has a trailing growth habit and produces numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its wider leaves compared to the typical form of Mimulus nepalensis."
