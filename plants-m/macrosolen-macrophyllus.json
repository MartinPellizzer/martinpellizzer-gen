    "intro": "Macrosolen macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features a short, underground rhizome with long, arching fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. Its leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity for optimal growth."
