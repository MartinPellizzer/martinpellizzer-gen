It is characterized by its dense, fluffy growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant forms compact cushions or mats, often found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral, with a distinctive whitish or pale green coloration.
