    "intro": "Miconia pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. Miconia pinetorum is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and potential to outcompete native vegetation."
