    "intro": "Medicago tetraprostrata, commonly known as the prostrate medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Medicago tetraprostrata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
