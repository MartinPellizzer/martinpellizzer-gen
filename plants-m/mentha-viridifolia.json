    "intro": "Mentha viridifolia, commonly known as green-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that appear in whorls along the stems. Mentha viridifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
