    "intro": "Manihot pachycaulis, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy underground stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are edible and have a starchy texture similar to that of taro or cassava. The plant is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
