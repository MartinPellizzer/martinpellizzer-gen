    "intro": "Miconia pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas where it has been introduced."
