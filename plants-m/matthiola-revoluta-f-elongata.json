    "intro": "Matthiola revoluta f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated wallflower, is a cultivar of the wallflower species characterized by its extended, linear leaves and showy, clustered flowers. This variety is prized for its vibrant, often bi-colored blooms that range from white to deep red, making it a popular choice in gardens. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial, reaching heights of 15 to 30 centimeters, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its foliage is narrow and upright, contributing to a compact, tidy growth habit. The elongated leaves and clustered flowers make it distinct from other Matthiola species, enhancing its ornamental value."
