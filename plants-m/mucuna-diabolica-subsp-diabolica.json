    "intro": "Mucuna diabolica subsp. diabolica, commonly known as the devil's bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces a significant amount of nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, and it blooms throughout the growing season. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is often avoided in agricultural settings."
