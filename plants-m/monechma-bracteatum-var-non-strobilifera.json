    "intro": "Monechma bracteatum var. non-strobilifera, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces vibrant orange to red flower heads. The plant blooms from summer to fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowering heads consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. The variety non-strobilifera is distinguished by its lack of strobilifera, a feature present in other varieties of the species."
