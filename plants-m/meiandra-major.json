    "intro": "Meiandra major, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinct purple or reddish hue at the base. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Meiandra major is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
