    "intro": "Melaleuca acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, pink, and grey. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in clusters, which are borne on branched inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax. Melaleuca acuminata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
