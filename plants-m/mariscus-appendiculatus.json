It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
