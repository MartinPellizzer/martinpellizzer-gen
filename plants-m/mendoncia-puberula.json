    "intro": "Mendoncia puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, foliage, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along streambanks. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, making it distinguishable from other similar species."
