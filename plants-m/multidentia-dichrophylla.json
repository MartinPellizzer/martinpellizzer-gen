It is characterized by its striking dichromatic foliage, with one side of the leaves displaying a vibrant green and the other a deep purple or red. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.
