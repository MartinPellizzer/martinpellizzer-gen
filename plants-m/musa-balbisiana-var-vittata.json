    "intro": "Musa balbisiana var. vittata, commonly known as the spotted banana, is a variant of the banana plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green and white or yellow patterns. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It produces edible bananas, though the fruit is often smaller and less sweet compared to commercial varieties. The variegation in its leaves makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
