It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often clustered leaves. The flowers are typically small and may be white or pink, with four to five petals. Microstemma species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded or moist environments. Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, many species are considered rare or endangered."
