    "intro": "Misandra strobilantha, commonly known as the spike-leaved orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens and botanical collections."
