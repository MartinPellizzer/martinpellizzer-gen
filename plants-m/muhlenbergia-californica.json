    "intro": "Muhlenbergia californica, commonly known as California muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-blue foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces airy plumes of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant ornamental grass. Muhlenbergia californica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
