    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia rupestris var. volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic muehlenbeckia, is a perennial flowering plant native to volcanic regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fuzzy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its adaptability to harsh, volcanic soils makes it an interesting species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
