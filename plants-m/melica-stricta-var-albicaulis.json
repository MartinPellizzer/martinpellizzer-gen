It typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine white bloom, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
