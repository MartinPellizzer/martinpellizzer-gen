    "intro": "Merostachys exserta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is drought-tolerant and has a low-growing habit, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
