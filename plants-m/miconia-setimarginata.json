    "intro": "Miconia setimarginata, commonly known as the red-margined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive red margin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Miconia setimarginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
