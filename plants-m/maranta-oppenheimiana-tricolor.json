    "intro": "Maranta oppenheimiana tricolor, commonly known as the tri-color prayer plant, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vivid, variegated leaves that display shades of red, pink, and green, making it highly ornamental. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its leaves curl upward at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is a unique adaptation. This species is popular among houseplants due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
