    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 locyana, commonly known as the hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a cross between Mentha \u00d7 piperita (peppermint) and Mentha \u00d7 cunninghamii (wild mint), resulting in a plant with a strong, aromatic scent. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or white. Mentha \u00d7 locyana is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its high menthol content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
