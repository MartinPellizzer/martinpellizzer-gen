    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf goatweed, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
