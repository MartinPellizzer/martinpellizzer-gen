    "intro": "Melocactus macracanthos, commonly known as the thick-armed melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features dense, spiny areoles covered with white, woolly bristles, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem during the warmer months. Melocactus macracanthos is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival."
