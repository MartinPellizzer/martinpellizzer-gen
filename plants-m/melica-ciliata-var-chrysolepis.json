    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive ciliate margin that gives it its species name. The inflorescence structure and flowering time make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
