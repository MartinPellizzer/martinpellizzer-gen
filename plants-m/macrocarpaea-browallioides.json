    "intro": "Macrocarpaea browallioides, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a unique structure with a central trunk covered in a fibrous sheath, and it produces spores on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
