    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum decurrens, commonly known as the zigzag ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique leaf structure and vibrant floral display make it a visually striking addition to arid landscapes."
