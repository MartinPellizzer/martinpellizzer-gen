    "intro": "Muhlenbergia foliosa, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and feathery, silver-blue foliage that adds a decorative touch to gardens. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia foliosa is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance requirements."
