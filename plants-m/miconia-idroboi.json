    "intro": "Miconia idroboi, commonly known as the Idrobo's miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the Andean region of South America, particularly Colombia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in some horticultural settings, though its ecological impact in non-native areas remains understudied."
