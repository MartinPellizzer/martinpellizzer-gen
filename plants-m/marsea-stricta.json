It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually pale blue or purple in color. Marsea stricta plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
