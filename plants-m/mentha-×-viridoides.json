    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 viridoides, commonly known as green mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata and Mentha viridis. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like fragrance and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is often found in damp woodlands or along stream banks. Mentha \u00d7 viridoides is valued for its use in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though it can be invasive in some regions. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive minty scent when crushed."
