    "intro": "Mildbraedia carpinifolia var. strigosa, commonly known as the woolly mildbraedia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
