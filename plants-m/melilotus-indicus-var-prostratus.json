It features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, producing small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
