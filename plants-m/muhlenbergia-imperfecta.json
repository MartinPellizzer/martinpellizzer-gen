    "intro": "Muhlenbergia imperfecta, commonly known as the redstem muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia imperfecta is valued for its low maintenance and ability to form dense, attractive clumps in well-drained soils."
