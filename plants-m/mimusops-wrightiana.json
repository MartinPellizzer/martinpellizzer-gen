    "intro": "Mimusops wrightiana, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The tree produces clusters of white, waxy flowers that resemble snowballs, which bloom in the dry season. These flowers are followed by orange to red fruits that split open to release sticky, viscid seeds. Mimusops wrightiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
