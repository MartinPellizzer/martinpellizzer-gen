    "intro": "Miconia secundolanceolata, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking foliage and flowers. However, it can be invasive in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems."
