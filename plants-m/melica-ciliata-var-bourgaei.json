    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. bourgaei, commonly known as the silky grass or Bourgai's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs covering the leaves and inflorescence, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and other wetland habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It is often valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in damp environments."
