    "intro": "Melicope sarcococca, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or greenish in color. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of Hawaii's unique flora."
