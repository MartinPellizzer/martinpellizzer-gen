It is characterized by its upright, square stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. Spearmint is native to Europe and parts of Asia but is now cultivated worldwide for its aromatic oils.
