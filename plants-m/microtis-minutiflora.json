    "intro": "Microtis minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered microtis, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
