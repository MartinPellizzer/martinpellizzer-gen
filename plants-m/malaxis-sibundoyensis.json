    "intro": "Malaxis sibundoyensis, commonly known as the Sibundoy orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and often have a distinctive coloration, which aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
