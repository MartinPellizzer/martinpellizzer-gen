    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 cardiaca var. kmetiana, commonly known as the Kmetian mint, is a hybrid species of mint native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like leaves and stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or stream banks. It produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its use in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb."
