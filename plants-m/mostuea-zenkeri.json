    "intro": "Mostuea zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's elephant's ear, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a dark green or variegated pattern. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which are borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining, rich soil to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
