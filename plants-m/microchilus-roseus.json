    "intro": "Microchilus roseus, commonly known as the rose petal orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that resemble rose petals, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
