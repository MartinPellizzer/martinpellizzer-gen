    "intro": "Monardella ledifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf monardella, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Monardella ledifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
