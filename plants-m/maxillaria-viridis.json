It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces vibrant green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer, with its inflorescence bearing several showy, spurred flowers. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria viridis is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
