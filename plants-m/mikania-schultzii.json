It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats. The plant has slender, climbing stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, elliptic to linear in shape, and often have a hairy texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures that aid in its dispersal."
