    "intro": "Maerua cylindrocarpa, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by cylindrical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and high temperatures. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been traditionally used for construction and as a source of fuel."
