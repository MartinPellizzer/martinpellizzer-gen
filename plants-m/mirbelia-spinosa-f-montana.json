It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
