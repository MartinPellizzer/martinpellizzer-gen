    "intro": "Minuartia mutabilis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings."
