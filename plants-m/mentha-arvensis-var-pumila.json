    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. pumila, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It has a mat-forming growth habit with aromatic, hairy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its essential oils, containing menthol and other compounds, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
