    "intro": "Myoporum semotum, commonly known as the New Zealand myoporum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
