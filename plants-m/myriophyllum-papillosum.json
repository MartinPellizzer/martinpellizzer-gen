    "intro": "Myriophyllum papillosum, commonly known as the featherleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it can form dense mats that influence water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Myriophyllum papillosum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
