    "intro": "Momordica cissoides, commonly known as the horned melon or African horned cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It produces distinctive, spiny, green fruits that resemble horns, with a thick, waxy rind. The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins, and is characterized by its tendrils and palmate leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it relies on insects for pollination. The fruit is edible when ripe, though its bitter taste is due to the presence of cucurbitacins."
