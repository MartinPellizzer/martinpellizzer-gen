    "intro": "Mikania sulcata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a weed in many regions."
