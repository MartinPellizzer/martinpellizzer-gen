    "intro": "Maerua macrantha, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in dry environments. It is adapted to saline soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh climates. The plant is also used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
