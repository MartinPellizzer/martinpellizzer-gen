    "intro": "Mapania purpuriceps, commonly known as the purple-headed mapania, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant features a distinctive purple-tinged stem and leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
