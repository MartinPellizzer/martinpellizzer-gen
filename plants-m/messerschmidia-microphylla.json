    "intro": "Messerschmidia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
