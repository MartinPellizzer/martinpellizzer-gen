    "intro": "Mimulopsis longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled mimulopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lythraceae, which includes plants such as the poinsettia and the willow herb. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Mimulopsis longisepala is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
