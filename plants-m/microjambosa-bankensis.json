It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
