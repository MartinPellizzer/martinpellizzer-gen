    "intro": "Mimosa tacimbensis, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
