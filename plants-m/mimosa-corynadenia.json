It features delicate, fern-like leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, fluffy white or yellow seed pods that split open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical interest lies in its unique leaf morphology and seasonal color changes."
