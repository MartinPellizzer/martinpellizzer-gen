    "intro": "Melilotus segetalis proles prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate melilot, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. It is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides."
