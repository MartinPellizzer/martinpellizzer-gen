    "intro": "Musa agharkarii, commonly known as the Khasi banana, is a species of banana native to the northeastern region of India. It is a herbaceous plant with a short, stout stem and large, broad leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, curved fruit. The fruit is typically harvested when it is still green and unripe, though it can be consumed once it ripens. It is valued for its unique flavor and is often used in local cuisines and traditional practices."
