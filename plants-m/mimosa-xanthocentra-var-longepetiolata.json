    "intro": "Mimosa xanthocentra var. longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled golden mimosa, is a variant of the golden mimosa, characterized by its elongated petioles and vibrant yellow flowers. It is a deciduous shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, fluffy seed pods that release seeds when mature, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
