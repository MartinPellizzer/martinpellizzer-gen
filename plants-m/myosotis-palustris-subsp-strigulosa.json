    "intro": "Myosotis palustris subsp. strigulosa, commonly known as the bog Forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, blue or violet flowers with five petals. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Myosotis genus, which are known for their delicate, flower-like appearance and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
