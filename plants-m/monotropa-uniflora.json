    "intro": "Monotropa uniflora, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It derives its nutrients from the mycorrhizal fungi associated with the roots of nearby trees, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower that is usually white or greenish-white in color. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories across eastern North America. Its unique ecological role and ethereal appearance have made it a subject of fascination in botanical studies."
