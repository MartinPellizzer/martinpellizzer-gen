    "intro": "Moehringia dasyphylla subsp. sedoides, commonly known as the Sierra beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, characterized by its hairy stems and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that rise from the center, making it well adapted to harsh mountain environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
