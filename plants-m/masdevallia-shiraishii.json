    "intro": "Masdevallia shiraishii, commonly known as the Shiraishi masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, intricate floral structure with vibrant colors and unique petal shapes. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid, thriving in cool, humid environments with filtered sunlight. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited natural habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
