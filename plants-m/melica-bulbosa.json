    "intro": "Melica bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bulbous base and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Melica bulbosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
