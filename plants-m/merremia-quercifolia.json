    "intro": "Merremia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often fragrant. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Merremia quercifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
