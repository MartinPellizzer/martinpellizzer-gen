    "intro": "Mimosa hymenaeodes, commonly known as the small mimosa or velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and clearings. Mimosa hymenaeodes is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
