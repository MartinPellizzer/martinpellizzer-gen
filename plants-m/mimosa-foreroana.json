    "intro": "Mimosa foreroana, commonly known as the Forero's sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique botanical features, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
