    "intro": "Micrechites pubiflorus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in rich, humus-filled soil. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, clustered flowers with hairy petals. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
