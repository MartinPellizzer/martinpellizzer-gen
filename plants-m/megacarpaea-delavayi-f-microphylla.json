    "intro": "Megacarpaea delavayi f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leafed giant carpaea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high altitudes of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive, large, fleshy fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are smaller than those of the typical species, hence the subspecies name *microphylla*, meaning \"small leaf.\" Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
