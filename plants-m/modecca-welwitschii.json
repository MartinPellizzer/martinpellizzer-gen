    "intro": "Modecca welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschii tree, is a unique species native to Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest known plant species, with some individuals estimated to be over 2,000 years old. The tree has a distinctive appearance, featuring a thick, gnarled trunk and sparse, waxy leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It is adapted to extreme drought, storing water in its trunk and having a deep root system. Its botanical significance lies in its resilience and its role in the ecosystems of the Namib Desert."
