    "intro": "Menonvillea rollinsii, commonly known as the R\u00edo Blanco bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow rosette of dark green, strap-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange-red bracts that enclose its showy, tubular flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among bromeliad enthusiasts."
