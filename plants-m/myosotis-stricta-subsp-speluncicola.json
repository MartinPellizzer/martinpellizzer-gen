    "intro": "Myosotis stricta subsp. speluncicola, commonly known as the cave mouse-ear, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to subterranean environments. It is characterized by its small, pale blue to white flowers and compact, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dim, moist habitats. This subspecies is typically found in limestone caves and rock crevices, where it thrives in low light conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves self-pollination, which is advantageous in isolated environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
