    "intro": "Melica glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairless or very sparsely hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, each containing two to three small, two-lobed florets. Melica glabrescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
