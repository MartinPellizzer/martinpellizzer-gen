    "intro": "Mammillaria uniseta, commonly known as the single-spine mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of white, woolly spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
