    "intro": "Miconia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
