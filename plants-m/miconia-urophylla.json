    "intro": "Miconia urophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense white or silver pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
