    "intro": "Moringa edulis, commonly known as the horseradish tree, is a fast-growing, drought-resistant plant native to tropical regions. It features a slender, branching stem with large, palmate leaves that are compound and lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into long, slender pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves, flowers, and seeds are all used in traditional medicine and as a food source due to their high nutritional value. Moringa edulis is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its potential for sustainable agriculture."
