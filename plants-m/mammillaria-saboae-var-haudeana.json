    "intro": "Mammillaria saboae var. haudeana, commonly known as the Haudenosaunee cactus or the sacred cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. Due to its cultural significance and rarity, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and botanical collections."
