    "intro": "Multidentia crassa, commonly known as the broad-toothed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its robust and often sprawling growth habit. It features large, compound fronds with multiple, broad, tooth-like lobes that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas effectively. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
