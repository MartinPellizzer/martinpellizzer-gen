    "intro": "Myosotis palustris subsp. lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, violet-blue flowers clustered in loose racemes. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. This subspecies thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
