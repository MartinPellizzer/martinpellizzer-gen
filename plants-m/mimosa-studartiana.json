    "intro": "Mimosa studartiana, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that close when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is often used in scientific studies on plant responses to environmental stimuli."
