It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. It has a compact growth habit and produces woody stems that can become quite branched over time. Myricaria germanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
