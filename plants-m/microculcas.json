    "intro": "Microculcas, commonly known as stonecrops, are succulent plants belonging to the family Crassulaceae. They are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. These plants typically have a low-growing, spreading habit and produce clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Native to temperate and alpine regions, they are often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Microculcas are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
