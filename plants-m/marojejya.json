The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan, often exceeding 100 years. Marojejya is notable for its distinctive seed structure and has been the subject of conservation efforts due to its threatened status. Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both ecological and evolutionary studies."
