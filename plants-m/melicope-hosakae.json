    "intro": "Melicope hosakae, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers. The tree typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and is often found in the understory of native Hawaiian vegetation. Its fruit is a small, green drupe that matures to a reddish color, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Melicope hosakae is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
