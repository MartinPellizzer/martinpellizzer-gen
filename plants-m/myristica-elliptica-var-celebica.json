It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of its aromatic seed pods. The seeds, known as mace, are covered in a bright red, lacy aril that is used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is valued for its unique aroma and is often cultivated for its economic and traditional significance."
