    "intro": "Mitella diphylla f. oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved mitella, is a botanical variant of the mitella plant, characterized by its distinctive opposite leaf arrangement. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its rugged appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
