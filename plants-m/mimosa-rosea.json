    "intro": "Mimosa rosea, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are sensitive to touch and will fold shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. Mimosa rosea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
