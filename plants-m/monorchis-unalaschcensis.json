    "intro": "Monorchis unalaschcensis, commonly known as the Alaskan orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in the subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and has a short growing season due to its cold climate. It has a single, slender stem with a single flower, which is usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
