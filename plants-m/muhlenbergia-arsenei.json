    "intro": "Muhlenbergia arsenei, commonly known as the Arizona grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces delicate, feathery seed heads that add ornamental value to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Muhlenbergia arsenei is often used in native plant gardens for its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
