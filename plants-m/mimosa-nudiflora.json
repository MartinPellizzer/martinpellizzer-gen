    "intro": "Mimosa nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flowered sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique botanical features make it both an ornamental and ecologically valuable plant."
