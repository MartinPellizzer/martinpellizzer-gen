    "intro": "Melaleuca cupularis, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in winter and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. Melaleuca cupularis is often found in coastal and wetland areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
