    "intro": "Micropholis ulei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped pods containing flat, winged seeds. Micropholis ulei is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
