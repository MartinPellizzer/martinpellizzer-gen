    "intro": "Melica viridis, commonly known as green brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring temperate climates. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Melica viridis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for wetland habitats."
