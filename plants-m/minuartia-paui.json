    "intro": "Minuartia paui, commonly known as the purple rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale purple in color. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Minuartia paui is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions."
