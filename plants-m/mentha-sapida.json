    "intro": "Mentha sapida, commonly known as cow parsley mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentha sapida is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. Its aromatic leaves are used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their mild minty flavor and potential health benefits."
