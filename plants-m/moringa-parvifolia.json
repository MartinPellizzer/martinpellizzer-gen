    "intro": "Moringa parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered moringa, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are rich in nutrients such as vitamins A and C, calcium, and protein. Moringa parvifolia is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
