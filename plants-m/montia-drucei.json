    "intro": "Montia drucei, commonly known as Druce's monkeyflower, is a delicate annual herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks. The plant features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that are usually pink or white, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Montia drucei is considered a rare and endangered species."
