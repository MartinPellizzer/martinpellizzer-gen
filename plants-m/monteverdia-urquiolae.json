    "intro": "Monteverdia urquiolae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian monteverdia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and persistent leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its growth habit is shrub-like, often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
