    "intro": "Moneses brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it has a short, upright stem. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
