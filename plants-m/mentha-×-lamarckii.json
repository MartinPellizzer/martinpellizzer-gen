    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 lamarckii, commonly known as apple mint, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha piperita (peppermint) and Mentha \u00d7 gracilis (wild mint). It is a perennial herb characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, typically in late summer. Its aromatic leaves emit a fresh, minty scent when crushed, making it popular in culinary and medicinal applications. Mentha \u00d7 lamarckii is native to Europe and has been widely cultivated for its aromatic properties and ornamental value."
