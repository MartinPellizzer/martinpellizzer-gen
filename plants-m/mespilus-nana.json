    "intro": "Mespilus nana, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous shrub or tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and smooth, dark grey bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Mespilus nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
