    "intro": "Magnolia lanuginosoides, commonly known as the woolly magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray or white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are typically white or pale pink and have a large, rounded shape. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9."
