    "intro": "Mahonia trifoliolata, commonly known as the western prickly barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three-lobed and have a dark green upper surface with a grayish-white underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its rugged appearance and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
