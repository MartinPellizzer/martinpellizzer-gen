    "intro": "Mattia corymbiformis var. polystachya, commonly known as the clustered mossy fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft green fronds that form dense, clustered growths, often resembling a moss-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in strobila, which are often found at the tips of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
