    "intro": "Mentha canescens var. maximilianea, commonly known as Mexican mint or Mexican horseweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-white due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils or along roadsides. Its aromatic leaves and strong menthol scent make it a popular choice for herbal teas and traditional medicine."
