    "intro": "Micropsis, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and is native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes. The plants typically grow in humid, shaded environments, often as epiphytes on trees or rocks. Micropsis species have narrow, strap-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species of Micropsis are considered endangered."
