    "intro": "Monotropa australis, commonly known as the Australian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host tree. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying on its host for carbohydrates. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Monotropa australis is found in temperate regions of Australia and is often associated with eucalyptus trees."
