    "intro": "Masdevallia datura, commonly known as the nightshade orchid, is a rare and exotic orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often violet or purple flowers that bloom during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, humid conditions with indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservatories."
