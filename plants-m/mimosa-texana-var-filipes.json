It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, grayish appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in sandy or rocky habitats. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it both a pioneer plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
