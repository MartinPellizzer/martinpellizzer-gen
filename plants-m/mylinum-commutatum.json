    "intro": "Mylinum commutatum, commonly known as the common myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves and berries contain essential oils, which contribute to its aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine. Mylinum commutatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
