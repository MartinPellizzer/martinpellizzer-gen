    "intro": "Mammillaria aulacothele var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiny appearance. Its spines are typically pale to dark brown and can be quite dense, providing protection from herbivores. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
