    "intro": "Mertensia paniculata var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
