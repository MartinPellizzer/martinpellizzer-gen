    "intro": "Microstachys tragioides, commonly known as the burr grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, needle-like leaves and produces tiny, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which helps it thrive in disturbed or sandy soils. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and stems that are often branched and covered in small, hooked bracts. Microstachys tragioides is typically found in open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and dunes."
