    "intro": "Mimosa sassa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Its unique movement and delicate appearance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
