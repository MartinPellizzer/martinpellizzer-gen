    "intro": "Mimosa arenosa, commonly known as the sand mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic movement. Mimosa arenosa is adapted to survive in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
