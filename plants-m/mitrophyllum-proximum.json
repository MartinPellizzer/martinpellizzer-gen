    "intro": "Mitrophyllum proximum, commonly known as the common mitrophyllum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
