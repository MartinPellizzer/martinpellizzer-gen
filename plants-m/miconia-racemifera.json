    "intro": "Miconia racemifera, commonly known as the tropical miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or yellow when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions."
