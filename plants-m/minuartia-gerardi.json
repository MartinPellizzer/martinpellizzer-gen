    "intro": "Minuartia gerardi, commonly known as the rock lettuce, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover in dry landscapes."
