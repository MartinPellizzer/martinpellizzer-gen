    "intro": "Mocinnodaphne, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It is characterized by its hard, dense wood and evergreen leaves that are typically opposite or whorled. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Mocinnodaphne species are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. These plants are valued for their durable wood and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
