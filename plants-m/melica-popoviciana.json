    "intro": "Melica popoviciana, commonly known as Popov's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among grasses. Melica popoviciana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
