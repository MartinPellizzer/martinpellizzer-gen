    "intro": "Mikania cercifolia, commonly known as Mexican morning glory, is a fast-growing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb and cover other vegetation. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
