    "intro": "Mimosa frondosa, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are made up of multiple pairs of oval, light green leaflets. The plant produces small, fluffy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long, slender seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to periodic flooding."
