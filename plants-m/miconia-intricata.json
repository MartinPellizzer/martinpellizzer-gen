    "intro": "Miconia intricata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia intricata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
