    "intro": "Moneses uniflora subsp. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a distinctive reticulate pattern on its petals, giving it its subspecies name. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
