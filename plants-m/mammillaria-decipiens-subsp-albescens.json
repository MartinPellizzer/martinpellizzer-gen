    "intro": "Mammillaria decipiens subsp. albescens, commonly known as the white-furred hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which bloom from areoles along the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
