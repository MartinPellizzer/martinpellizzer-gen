It is characterized by its silvery-white, feathery leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding when disturbed. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardens."
