    "intro": "Morus mongolica var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern China and parts of Mongolia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often rounded at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other animals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
