    "intro": "Monstera limitaris, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble a cheese grater, with holes and splits that increase in size as the plant matures. The plant typically grows on trees or shrubs in its natural habitat, using its aerial roots to anchor itself. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
