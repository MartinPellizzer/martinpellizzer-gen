    "intro": "Mikania tenax, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively make it both a popular ornamental plant and a significant invasive species in many regions. The fibrous roots and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
