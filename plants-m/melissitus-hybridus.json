    "intro": "Melissitus hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red or orange and contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. Melissitus hybridus is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
