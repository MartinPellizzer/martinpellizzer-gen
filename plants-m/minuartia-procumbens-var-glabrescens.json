    "intro": "Minuartia procumbens var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that become smooth as it matures, giving it its varietal name \"glabrescens.\" It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and mountain slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh environmental conditions."
