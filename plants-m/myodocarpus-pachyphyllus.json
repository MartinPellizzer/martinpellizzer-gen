    "intro": "Myodocarpus pachyphyllus, commonly known as the thick-leafed myodocarpus, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its thick leaves are an adaptation to arid environments, helping to reduce water loss. The species is often found in secondary forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses."
