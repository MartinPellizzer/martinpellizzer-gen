    "intro": "Mimosa pellita var. dehiscens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that split open when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as a ornamental plant. Its rapid leaf closure makes it a popular subject in botanical studies on plant responses to environmental stimuli."
