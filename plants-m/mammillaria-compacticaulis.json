    "intro": "Mammillaria compacticaulis, commonly known as the compacticaulis cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense arrangement of tubercles that give it a rounded, compact appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for succulent collectors."
