It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Cowpea is widely cultivated for both its nutritional seeds and its role in sustainable agriculture."
