    "intro": "Miconia heterotricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Miconia heterotricha is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
