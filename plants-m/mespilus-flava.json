    "intro": "Mespilus flava, commonly known as the yellow medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested in autumn, though they are often astringent and require ripening before consumption. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. The yellow medlar is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental foliage."
