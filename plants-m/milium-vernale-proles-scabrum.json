It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, dry seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
