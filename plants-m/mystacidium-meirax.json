    "intro": "Mystacidium meirax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate white or greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves."
