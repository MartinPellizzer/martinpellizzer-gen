    "intro": "Mimosa glauca, commonly known as the blue mist shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fern-like leaves that turn a striking blue-gray color, especially in full sun. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white flower clusters that bloom in the spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Mimosa glauca is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic shared with other mimosa species."
