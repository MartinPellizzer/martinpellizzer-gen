    "intro": "Micropiper recurvatum, commonly known as the zigzag swampweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the surface of water or moist soil. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Micropiper recurvatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
