It is characterized by its hairy leaves and a distinct aromatic scent, typical of the Mentha genus. This subspecies thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, giving it its specific name. The plant is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments, where it adapts well to alkaline conditions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
