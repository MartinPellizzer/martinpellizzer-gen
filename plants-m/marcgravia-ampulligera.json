    "intro": "Marcgravia ampulligera, commonly known as the giant water fig, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with bright yellow petals and a distinctive red calyx. Its unique feature is the presence of a large, hollow fruit that resembles a water-filled vessel, which is why it is also called the water fig. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
