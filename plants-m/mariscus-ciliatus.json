    "intro": "Mariscus ciliatus, commonly known as the curled leaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Mariscus ciliatus is a herbaceous perennial that is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
