    "intro": "Maxillaria maculata, commonly known as the spotted maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Maxillaria maculata is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
