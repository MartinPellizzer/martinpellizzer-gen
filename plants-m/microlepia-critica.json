    "intro": "Microlepia critica, commonly known as the critical microlepia, is a fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
