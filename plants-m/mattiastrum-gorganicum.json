    "intro": "Mattiastrum gorganicum, commonly known as the golden mat grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features wiry, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mattiastrum gorganicum is often used in native plant gardens for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its low maintenance requirements."
