    "intro": "Manulea corymbosa, commonly known as the mountain pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique structure provides insulation against cold temperatures, aiding in its survival at high elevations.
