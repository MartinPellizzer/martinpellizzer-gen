    "intro": "Masdevallia discoidea, commonly known as the \"moon orchid,\" is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, moon-shaped pseudobulbs and its striking, dark purple to black flowers with contrasting white and yellow markings. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with high air circulation and indirect light. Its flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only a few days, and it blooms once or twice a year. Masdevallia discoidea is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unusual appearance and rarity in cultivation."
