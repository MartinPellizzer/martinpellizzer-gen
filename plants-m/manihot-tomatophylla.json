    "intro": "Manihot tomatophylla, commonly known as the red-leaf arrowleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color, particularly on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellow, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its striking foliage."
