It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
