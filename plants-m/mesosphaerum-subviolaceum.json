It is characterized by its distinctive violet-colored foliage, which sets it apart from other species in the genus. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native habitat."
