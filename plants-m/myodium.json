    "intro": "Myodium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost spectral in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Myodium thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a highly specialized and endangered species."
