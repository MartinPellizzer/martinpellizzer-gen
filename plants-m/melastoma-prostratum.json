    "intro": "Melastoma prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate melastoma, is a low-growing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Melastoma prostratum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
