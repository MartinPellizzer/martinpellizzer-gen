    "intro": "Megalastrum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed leek, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its strap-like, linear leaves and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
