    "intro": "Mitella doiana, commonly known as the Pacific silverweed, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Mitella doiana thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
