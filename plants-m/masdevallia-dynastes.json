It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures and is part of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with a distinctive shape that includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species. Masdevallia dynastes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively compact growth habit."
