    "intro": "Monolopia californica, commonly known as the California spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as coastal bluffs and chaparral. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
