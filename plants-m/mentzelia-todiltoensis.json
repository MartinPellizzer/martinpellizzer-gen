It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry plains. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
