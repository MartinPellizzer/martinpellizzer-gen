    "intro": "Mirabilis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the evening. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its sticky secretions, it can be difficult to handle without gloves."
