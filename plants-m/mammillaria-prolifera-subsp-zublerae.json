    "intro": "Mammillaria prolifera subsp. zublerae, commonly known as the Zulber's nipple cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines and has a distinctive, rounded shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. This subspecies is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
