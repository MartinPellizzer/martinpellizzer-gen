    "intro": "Malaxis confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It has a unique root system adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and its cryptic nature, Malaxis confusa is considered endangered and is often difficult to study in the wild."
