    "intro": "Mediocalcar angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, four-petaled white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
