    "intro": "Mucuna schlechteri, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing several elliptical, brown seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Mucuna schlechteri is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
