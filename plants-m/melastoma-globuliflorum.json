    "intro": "Melastoma globuliflorum, commonly known as the globular-flowered melastoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its compact shrub form and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture, while the fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Melastoma globuliflorum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
