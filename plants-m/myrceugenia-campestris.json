    "intro": "Myrceugenia campestris, commonly known as the coastal myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Myrceugenia campestris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh coastal conditions."
