    "intro": "Margaritopsis abrupta, commonly known as the abrupt margaritopsis, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, tubular flowers. The plant typically features bright yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Margaritopsis abrupta is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
