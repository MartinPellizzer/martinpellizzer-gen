    "intro": "Monardella odoratissima var. follettii, commonly known as the Sierra Lemonade plant, is a flowering perennial native to California. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
