    "intro": "Melissitus rostratus, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among plants in the Asclepiadaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is hairy and often reddish in color. Melissitus rostratus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
