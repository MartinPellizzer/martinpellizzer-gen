    "intro": "Miconia collayensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia collayensis*, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its ecological impact, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
