    "intro": "Marrubium eriostachyum, commonly known as the woolly horehound, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties. Marrubium eriostachyum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
