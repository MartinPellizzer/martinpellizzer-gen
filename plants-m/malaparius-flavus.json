    "intro": "Malaparius flavus, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and emit a mild scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Malaparius flavus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
