    "intro": "Mephitidia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mephit, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowlands of Southeast Asia. It features broad, waxy leaves that are often a deep green with a subtle silver underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with a faintly sweet scent, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is classified as an endangered species in its natural range."
