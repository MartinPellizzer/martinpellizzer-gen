    "intro": "Macrozamia occidua, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and it has a long growth period with a slow maturation process. Macrozamia occidua is also notable for its ability to survive in coastal environments with high salinity and exposure to wind."
