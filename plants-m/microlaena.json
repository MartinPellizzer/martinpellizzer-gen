    "intro": "Microlaena, commonly known as spear grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Microlaena stipoides, which is native to Australia. These plants are typically perennial and are characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. They often thrive in disturbed soils and are commonly found in grasslands and along roadsides. Microlaena species are also valued for their role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
