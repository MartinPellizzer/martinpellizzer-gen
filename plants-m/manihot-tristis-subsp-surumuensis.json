    "intro": "Manihot tristis subsp. surumuensis, commonly known as Surumu wild cassava, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, simple leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its potential for erosion control and its role in local ecosystems, it has ecological significance in its native range."
