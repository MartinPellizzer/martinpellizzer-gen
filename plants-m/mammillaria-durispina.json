    "intro": "Mammillaria durispina, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of small, spiny tubercles. The plant typically features pale green to bluish-gray stems with white or pale blue spines. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Mammillaria durispina is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
