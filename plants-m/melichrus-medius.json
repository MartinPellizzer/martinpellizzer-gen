    "intro": "Melichrus medius, commonly known as the lesser marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
