    "intro": "Monnina resedoides var. crispata, commonly known as velvetleaf monnina, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
