    "intro": "Malleola aberrans, commonly known as the wandering mallow, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its unique growth habit, where new shoots often emerge from the base, contributes to its common name. Malleola aberrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
