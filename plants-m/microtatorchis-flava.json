    "intro": "Microtatorchis flava, commonly known as the golden microtatorchis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
