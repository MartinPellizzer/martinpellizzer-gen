    "intro": "Magnolia oscarrodrigoi, commonly known as the Oscar Rodriguez magnolia, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and provide a striking contrast to its floral display. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
