    "intro": "Microchilus ensicalcar, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that are often camouflaged among rocks and crevices. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. Its botanical features include a short, creeping rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microchilus ensicalcar is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
