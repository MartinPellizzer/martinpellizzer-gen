    "intro": "Mimosa incana var. robusta, commonly known as the rough mimosoid, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is also suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
