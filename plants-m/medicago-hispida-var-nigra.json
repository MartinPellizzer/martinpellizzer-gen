It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and dark-colored pods that resemble horns, hence its common name. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
