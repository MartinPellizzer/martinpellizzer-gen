    "intro": "Mertensia ovata, commonly known as the ovate bluebells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of striking blue-violet flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Mertensia ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
