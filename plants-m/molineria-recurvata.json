    "intro": "Molineria recurvata, commonly known as the recurved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Molineria recurvata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
