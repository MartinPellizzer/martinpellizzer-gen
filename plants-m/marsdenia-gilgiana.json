    "intro": "Marsdenia gilgiana, commonly known as the Gilgian Marsdenia, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by follicle fruits containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forest understories where it uses its tendrils to climb towards light. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
