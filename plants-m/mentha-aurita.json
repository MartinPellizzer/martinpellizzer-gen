    "intro": "Mentha aurita, commonly known as yellow mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Mentha aurita is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
