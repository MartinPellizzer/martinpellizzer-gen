    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica subsp. rivularis, commonly known as the water forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or aquatic habitats, such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained but consistently damp soil. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of blue or violet flowers with five petals, which are often tinged with white at the base. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or naturalized areas where it can flourish."
