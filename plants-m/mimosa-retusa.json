    "intro": "Mimosa retusa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa retusa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
