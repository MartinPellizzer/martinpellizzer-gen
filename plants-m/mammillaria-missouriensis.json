    "intro": "Mammillaria missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the United States. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to protect it from environmental stress."
