    "intro": "Martinieria, commonly known as the \"scented orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their fragrant, showy flowers that often have a complex, spicy scent. Martinieria species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, meaning they attach to trees or rocks for support. Their botanical features include long, narrow leaves and intricate floral structures that attract specific pollinators."
