    "intro": "Mammillaria prolifera subsp. arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider milkplant, is a small cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and a compact, globular shape. The plant produces white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its stems are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
