It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in herbal teas or as a ornamental plant."
