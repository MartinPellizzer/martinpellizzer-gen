    "intro": "Microcerasus prostrata var. bifrons, commonly known as the creeping snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by small, bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and delicate appearance."
