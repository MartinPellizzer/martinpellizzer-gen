    "intro": "Mormodes andicola, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually across rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
