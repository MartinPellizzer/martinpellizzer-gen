    "intro": "Marattia verschaffeltiana, commonly known as the Van der Vegt's fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae, characterized by its large, compound fronds and lack of true leaves. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a creeping rhizome that produces both vegetative and reproductive structures. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a glossy, dark green appearance and a distinctive, elongated shape. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Marattia verschaffeltiana is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
