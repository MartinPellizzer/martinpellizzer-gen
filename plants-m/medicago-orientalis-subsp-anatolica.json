    "intro": "Medicago orientalis subsp. anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian clover, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to improve soil fertility."
