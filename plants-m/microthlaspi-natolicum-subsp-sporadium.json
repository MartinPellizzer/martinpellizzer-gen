It is a small, perennial herb with basal leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme mountain conditions."
