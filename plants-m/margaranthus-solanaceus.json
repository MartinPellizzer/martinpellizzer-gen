It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its large, showy, white to yellow flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Margaranthus solanaceus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
