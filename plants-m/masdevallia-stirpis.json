    "intro": "Masdevallia stirpis, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with intricate, often brightly colored flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its environment. Masdevallia stirpis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
