    "intro": "Malaxis weberbaueriana, commonly known as the Weberbauer's snake orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that resembles a snake's head. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
