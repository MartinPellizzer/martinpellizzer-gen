    "intro": "Moquilea celiae, commonly known as the Celia's moquilea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. It is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Moquilea celiae is considered a vulnerable species."
