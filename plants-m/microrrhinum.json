    "intro": "Microrrhinum, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its early spring blooming habit, producing bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it typically grows in moist, woodland areas. Microrrhinum is known for its rhizomatous growth, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
