    "intro": "Meiracyllium trinasutum, commonly known as the three-nosed meiracyllium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Meiracyllium trinasutum is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
