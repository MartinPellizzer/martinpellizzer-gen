    "intro": "Miconia mariae, commonly known as the Marie's miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-pink bracts that enclose its small flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, featuring both male and female reproductive structures, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Miconia mariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
