    "intro": "Microlicia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant has a distinctive white, fragrant flower that blooms at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its stems are long and flexible. Microlicia macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
