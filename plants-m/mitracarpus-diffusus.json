    "intro": "Mitracarpus diffusus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Mitracarpus diffusus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
