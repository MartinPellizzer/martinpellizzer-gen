    "intro": "Monotropa taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan ghostplant, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying on other plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique growth habit and lack of leaves make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies. It is often found in shaded, forested areas where it attaches itself to the roots of trees."
