    "intro": "Mostacillastrum dianthoides, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
