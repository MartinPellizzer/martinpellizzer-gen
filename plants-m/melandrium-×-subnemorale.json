    "intro": "Melandrium \u00d7 subnemorale, commonly known as the common or false sandwort, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Melandrium album and Melandrium sanguineum. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in woodland edges and meadows. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
