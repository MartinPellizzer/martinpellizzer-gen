    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. media, commonly known as the dwarf apple, is a compact variant of the wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only 1-2 meters in height, making it ideal for smaller gardens or container cultivation. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common apples but often more tart. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in a variety of climates, and it is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and potential for hybridization. This form is often used in horticultural breeding programs to enhance disease resistance and fruit quality in cultivated apple varieties."
