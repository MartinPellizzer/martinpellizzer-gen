    "intro": "Melica festucoides, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. Botanically, it is part of the Poaceae family and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
