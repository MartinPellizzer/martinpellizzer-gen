    "intro": "Mikania filicifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved Mikania, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
