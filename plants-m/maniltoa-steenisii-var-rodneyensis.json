    "intro": "Maniltoa steenisii var. rodneyensis, commonly known as the Rodney's maniltoa, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
