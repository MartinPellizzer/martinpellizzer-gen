It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
