    "intro": "Mnemion tricolor, commonly known as the three-color milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers, which typically display red, yellow, and white petals. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including insects and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Mnemion tricolor is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
