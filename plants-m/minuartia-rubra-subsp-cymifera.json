    "intro": "Minuartia rubra subsp. cymifera, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, helping it conserve water in its arid habitat. This subspecies is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across the northern hemisphere."
