    "intro": "Mouriri arenicola, commonly known as the coastal mouriri, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is a small shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune ecosystems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Mouriri arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
