    "intro": "Mimosa varia, commonly known as the variable mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its sensitive foliage, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in temperate regions."
