    "intro": "Mascagnia bracteosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry climates. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its showy, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Mascagnia bracteosa is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary response to survive in nutrient-poor, drought-prone habitats."
