    "intro": "Masdevallia lychniphora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals and sepals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. This epiphytic plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing on trees or rocks in shaded environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and pale pink, are highly fragrant and attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Masdevallia lychniphora is considered a critically endangered species."
