    "intro": "Macrothelypteris, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Macrothelypteris species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
