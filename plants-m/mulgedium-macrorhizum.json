    "intro": "Mulgedium macrorhizum, commonly known as the large-rooted mulgedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy roots that can grow quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinct, aromatic scent. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale green or white, appearing in late spring to early summer. Mulgedium macrorhizum is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
