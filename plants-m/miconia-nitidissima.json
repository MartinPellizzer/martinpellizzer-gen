    "intro": "Miconia nitidissima, commonly known as the glossy miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, shiny, elliptical leaves that are often a deep green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in branched inflorescences, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and showy fruit. However, it can be invasive in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems."
