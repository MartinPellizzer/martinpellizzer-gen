    "intro": "Macaranga stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping paper mullet, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. The species is notable for its ability to form dense mats through its stoloniferous growth habit, which helps in soil stabilization and ecological succession."
