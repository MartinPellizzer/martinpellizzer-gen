    "intro": "Microsorum curranii, commonly known as the Curran's fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and slightly serrated. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the substrate. Microsorum curranii is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
