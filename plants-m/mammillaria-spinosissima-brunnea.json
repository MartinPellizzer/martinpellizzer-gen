It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a compact growth habit. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
