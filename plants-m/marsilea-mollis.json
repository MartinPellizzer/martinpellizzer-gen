    "intro": "Marsilea mollis, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with tiny, clover-like leaves on the surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are typically found on the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in ponds and marshes. Marsilea mollis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
