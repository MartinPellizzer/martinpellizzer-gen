    "intro": "Moluccella armata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, berry-like fruit that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animal contact. Moluccella armata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
