    "intro": "Melandrium requienii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Melandrium requienii is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations."
