    "intro": "Miconia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Miconia angustifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a notable species in ecological studies."
