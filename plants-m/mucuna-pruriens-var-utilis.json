It is characterized by its hairy, bean-like pods and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces a distinctive, sticky seed coat that can cause an itchy sensation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
