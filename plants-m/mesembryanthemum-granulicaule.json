    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum granulicaule, commonly known as the granular mesem, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are covered in a fine, granular texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in Mediterranean climates."
