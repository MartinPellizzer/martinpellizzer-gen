    "intro": "Maihuenia, commonly known as the desert cushion, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes species like buckwheat and sorrel. Maihuenia plants are characterized by their dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps them survive in arid environments. They have small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of tiny, greenish flowers. These plants are adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture, making them resilient in harsh desert conditions."
