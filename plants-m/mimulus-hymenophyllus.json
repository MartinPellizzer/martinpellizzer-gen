    "intro": "Mimulus hymenophyllus, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces small, bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, giving it a unique, fern-like appearance. Mimulus hymenophyllus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
