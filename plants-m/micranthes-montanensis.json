    "intro": "Micranthes montanensis, commonly known as mountain micranthes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Micranthes montanensis is characterized by its low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
