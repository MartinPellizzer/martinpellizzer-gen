    "intro": "Moschopsis leyboldii, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often lie along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it spread and colonize moist environments. Moschopsis leyboldii thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
