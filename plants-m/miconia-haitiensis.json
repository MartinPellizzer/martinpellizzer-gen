It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces showy, pink to red bracteate flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Miconia haitiensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats within humid forests."
