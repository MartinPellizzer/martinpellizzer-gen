It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and ecological restoration projects. Its adaptability makes it a valuable species in both agricultural and environmental contexts."
