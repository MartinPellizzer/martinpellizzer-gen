    "intro": "Mentha rubella, commonly known as the red mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinct reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. Its small, pale purple flowers appear in whorls along the stem, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild mint-like fragrance. Mentha rubella is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
