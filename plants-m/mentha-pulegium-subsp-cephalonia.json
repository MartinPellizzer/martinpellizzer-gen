    "intro": "Mentha pulegium subsp. cephalonia, commonly known as Cyprus mint, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This subspecies is valued for its strong mint-like fragrance and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties."
