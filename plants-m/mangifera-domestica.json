    "intro": "Mangifera domestica, commonly known as the common mango, is a tropical fruit-bearing tree native to South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its large, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellow-orange fruits. The fruit's outer skin, or exocarp, turns from green to yellow as it ripens, while the inner mesocarp is fibrous and rich in nutrients. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and produces flowers that are initially green and later turn red. Its fruit is widely cultivated for its sweet, pulpy flesh and is a significant crop in many tropical regions."
