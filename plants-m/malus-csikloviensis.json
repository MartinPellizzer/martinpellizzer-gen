    "intro": "Malus csikloviensis, commonly known as the Csikloviensis apple tree, is a rare and ancient species native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits with a distinctive red and yellow coloration. The plant typically grows in forested areas and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
