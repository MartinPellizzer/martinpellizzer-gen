    "intro": "Molinadendron guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan molinadendron, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with palmate leaves that are often lobed. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
