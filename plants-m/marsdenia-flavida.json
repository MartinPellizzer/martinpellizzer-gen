    "intro": "Marsdenia flavida, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Marsdenia, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the warm season. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Marsdenia flavida is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some cultures."
