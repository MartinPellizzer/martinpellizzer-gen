    "intro": "Myristica moschata, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). The plant produces both a seed and a resin, with the seed being the source of the spice nutmeg. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of compounds like myristicin and elemicin. The tree is also valued for its ornamental value and has been historically significant in global trade."
