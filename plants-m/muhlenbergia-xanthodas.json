It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and produces fluffy, pale yellow plumes in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It is drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and wildlife habitats."
