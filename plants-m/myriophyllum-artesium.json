It has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with moderate to high light penetration. Myriophyllum artesium plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
