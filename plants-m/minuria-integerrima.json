    "intro": "Minuria integerrima, commonly known as the smooth minuria, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the thin, rocky soils where it grows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Minuria integerrima is considered a vulnerable species."
