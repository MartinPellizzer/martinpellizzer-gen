    "intro": "Micropiper nervosovenosum, commonly known as the veiny water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is characterized by its intricate network of veins, which give it its scientific name. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water's surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. Micropiper nervosovenosum plays a minor but important role in the ecological balance of its wetland habitats."
