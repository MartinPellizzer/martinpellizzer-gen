    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. major, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to blue-green inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue, and the plant is highly drought-tolerant once established. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
