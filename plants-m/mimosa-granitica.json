    "intro": "Mimosa granitica, commonly known as the granite mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to environmental stimuli. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Mimosa granitica is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and resilience."
