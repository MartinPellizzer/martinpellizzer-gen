    "intro": "Momordica cardiospermoides, commonly known as the \"heartseed\" or \"false cucumber,\" is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that give way to orange, spiky fruits containing small, round seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it has a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins."
