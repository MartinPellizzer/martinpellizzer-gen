    "intro": "Mascagnia rupicola, commonly known as the rock mascagnia, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in environments with limited water availability. Its ability to store moisture in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant. Mascagnia rupicola is often found in coastal and inland desert areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
