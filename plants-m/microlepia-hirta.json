    "intro": "Microlepia hirta, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The hairy texture of its fronds gives it its common name and contributes to its distinctive appearance."
