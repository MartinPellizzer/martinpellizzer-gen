    "intro": "Mandevilla tristis, commonly known as the devil\u2019s ivy, is a flowering vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Mandevilla tristis is also notable for its ability to climb or trail, making it versatile for use in hanging baskets, trellises, or as a ground cover."
