    "intro": "Matayba peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The tree produces small, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
