    "intro": "Mimulus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly monkeyflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Mimulus lanatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
