    "intro": "Malleola sphingoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its ability to thrive without soil, often growing on tree branches or other substrates. The plant has a single, slender stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms during the late spring and early summer. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its ecological significance and endangered status. Malleola sphingoides is also known for its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which aid in its nutrient absorption."
