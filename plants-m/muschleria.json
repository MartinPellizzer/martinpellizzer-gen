It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Muschleria typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
