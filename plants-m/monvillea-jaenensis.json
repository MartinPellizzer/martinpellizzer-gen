    "intro": "Monvillea jaenensis, commonly known as the Jaen's monvillea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Spain. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically tubular with bright colors, often in shades of red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monvillea jaenensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
