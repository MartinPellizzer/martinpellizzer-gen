    "intro": "Magnistipula devriesii, commonly known as the Devries' magnistipula, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, elongated stipules that are often mistaken for leaves. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
