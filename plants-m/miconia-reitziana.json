    "intro": "Miconia reitziana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
