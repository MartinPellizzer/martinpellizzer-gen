    "intro": "Mitrasacme laricifolia, commonly known as the pine-leaf mitrasacme, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves that resemble those of pine trees. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
