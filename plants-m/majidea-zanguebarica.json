    "intro": "Majidea zanguebarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
