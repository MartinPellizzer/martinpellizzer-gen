    "intro": "Masdevallia cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble small, intricate orchid blooms. The plant typically produces pendant inflorescences with numerous small, showy flowers that are often tinged with shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. This orchid thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
