    "intro": "Myrtus emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Myrtus emarginata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its aromatic properties have made it valuable in traditional medicine and perfumery."
