It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Mimosa nycteridis is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut in response to touch or light changes."
