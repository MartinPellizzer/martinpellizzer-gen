    "intro": "Miconia fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
