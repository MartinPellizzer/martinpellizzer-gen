    "intro": "Maxillaria minuta var. minor, commonly known as the miniature maxillaria, is a compact orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a yellowish lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new pseudobulbs along its rhizome. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. This variety is prized for its miniature size and delicate floral display."
