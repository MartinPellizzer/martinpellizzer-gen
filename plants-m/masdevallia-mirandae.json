    "intro": "Masdevallia mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that range in color from deep purples to vibrant reds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, often in the early morning, and are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
