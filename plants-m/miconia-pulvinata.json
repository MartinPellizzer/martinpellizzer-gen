    "intro": "Miconia pulvinata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its fruits are round, fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing numerous small seeds. Miconia pulvinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
