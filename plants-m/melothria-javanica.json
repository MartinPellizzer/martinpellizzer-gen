It produces small, round, green fruits that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. The fruit is edible, though some describe its taste as slightly sour or bitter."
