    "intro": "Medicago prostrata var. pubescens, commonly known as the prostrate medic. This low-growing annual legume is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems and leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its trifoliate leaves are typically covered with fine pubescence. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is valued for its forage quality and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
