    "intro": "Magnolia hookeri var. longirostrata, commonly known as the long-beaked magnolia, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of its glossy, elongated leaves. The plant features a distinctive elongated floral tube, which gives it its common name and sets it apart from other magnolia species. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that provide a lush green backdrop to its dramatic blooms. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
