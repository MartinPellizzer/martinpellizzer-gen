    "intro": "Myrtus buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dense and resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its aromatic leaves emit a subtle, sweet scent, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Myrtus buxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and hardy nature."
