    "intro": "Machilus lenticellatus, commonly known as the fragrant woodbine, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark that develops small, corky lenticels, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, dark green leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Machilus lenticellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
