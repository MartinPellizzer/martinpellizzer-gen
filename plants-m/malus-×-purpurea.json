    "intro": "Malus \u00d7 purpurea, commonly known as the purpleleaf sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged leaves, which turn vibrant red in the fall, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces showy white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart red berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its compact size and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental hedges and specimen plants."
