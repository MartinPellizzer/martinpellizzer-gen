    "intro": "Maxillaria lehmannii, commonly known as the Lemon-scented Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The orchid produces small, greenish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
