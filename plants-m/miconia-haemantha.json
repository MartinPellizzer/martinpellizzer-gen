    "intro": "Miconia haemantha, commonly known as the red miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that are often surrounded by bright red bracts, giving it a dramatic appearance. Miconia haemantha is also notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
