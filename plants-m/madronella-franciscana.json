    "intro": "Madronella franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan madrona, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along the coast, where it is adapted to coastal climates with high salt spray. Its unique habitat and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some areas."
