    "intro": "Mimosa acutistipula, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, spherical seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and unique foliage make it a popular choice for gardens and educational purposes."
