    "intro": "Mildella leonardii, commonly known as the Leonard's mildew lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a finely granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which provides it with nutrients. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in moist, shaded environments. Mildella leonardii is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to assess air quality."
