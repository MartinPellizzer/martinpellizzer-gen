    "intro": "Mespilus flexispina, commonly known as the flexible thorned medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and distinctive, urn-shaped fruits that ripen in late summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, while the flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters. The plant is notable for its thorny stems, which provide structural support and defense against herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows."
