    "intro": "Malaxis seramica, commonly known as the Seram orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Seram in Indonesia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and delicate, often with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Malaxis seramica is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
