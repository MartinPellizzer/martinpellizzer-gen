    "intro": "Mentha aquatica subsp. litoralis, commonly known as sea mint, is a perennial herb that thrives in moist or aquatic environments. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in coastal areas, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. Its subspecies distinction is based on its habitat and morphological adaptations to aquatic conditions."
