    "intro": "Modecca nigricans, commonly known as black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline, waterlogged soils. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the branches. It produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Modecca nigricans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and filtering water."
