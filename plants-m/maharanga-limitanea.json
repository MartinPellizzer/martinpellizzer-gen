    "intro": "Maharanga limitanea, commonly known as the coastal maharanga, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Maharanga limitanea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils along the shoreline."
