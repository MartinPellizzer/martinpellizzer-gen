    "intro": "Melinis minutiflora var. mutica, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces fibrous, rhizomatous roots that allow it to spread aggressively and colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a bluish-green color, while its seeds are small and dispersed by wind. Buffelgrass is often invasive in arid and semi-arid regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering ecosystem dynamics."
