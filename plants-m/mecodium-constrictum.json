It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Mecodium constrictum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique floral display."
