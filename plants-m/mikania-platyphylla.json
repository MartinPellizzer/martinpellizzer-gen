It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit. The plant features heart-shaped, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as forest edges and stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
