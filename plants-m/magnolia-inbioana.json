    "intro": "Magnolia inbioana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
