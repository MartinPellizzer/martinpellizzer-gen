    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 glomerulata, commonly known as marsh mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in damp environments and is often found near streams, marshes, and ponds. Due to its adaptability and ecological benefits, it is valued in wetland restoration projects."
