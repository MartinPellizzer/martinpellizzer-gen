    "intro": "Mononeuria cumberlandensis, commonly known as the Cumberland stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
