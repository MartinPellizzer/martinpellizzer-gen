    "intro": "Mulinum spinosum var. quinquepartitum, commonly known as the five-parted thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of spiny, lance-shaped leaves that are divided into five parts, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and distinctive leaf morphology make it easily identifiable in its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
