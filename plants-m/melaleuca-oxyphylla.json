    "intro": "Melaleuca oxyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a range of colors, from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. Melaleuca oxyphylla is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
