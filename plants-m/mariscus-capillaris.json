    "intro": "Mariscus capillaris, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its succulent leaves help it store water, adapting it to survive in dry environments. Mariscus capillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
