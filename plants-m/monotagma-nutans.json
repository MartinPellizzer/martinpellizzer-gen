    "intro": "Monotagma nutans, commonly known as the leaning monocot, is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curve downward. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typical of grass species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its delicate structure and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health."
