    "intro": "Mascagnia allopterys, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, blooming in the evening and emitting a mild fragrance. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Mascagnia allopterys is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
