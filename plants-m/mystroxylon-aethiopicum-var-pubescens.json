    "intro": "Mystroxylon aethiopicum var. pubescens, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, smooth, gray bark and produces a fruit with a hard, woody shell enclosing a high-fat seed. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in savanna woodlands. Its seeds are the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and cooking. The varietal form, pubescens, distinguishes it by its hairy or pubescent characteristics on its stems and leaves."
