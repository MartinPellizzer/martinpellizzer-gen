It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that is typically adorned with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, where it relies on specific microclimates and symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
