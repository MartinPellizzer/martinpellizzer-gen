    "intro": "Mimosa radula var. semitonsa, commonly known as the coastal mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces fluffy, yellowish-white flower clusters that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The species is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate mild drought conditions, making it well-suited to coastal environments."
