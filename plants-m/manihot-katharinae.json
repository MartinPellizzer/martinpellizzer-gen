    "intro": "Manihot katharinae, commonly known as the Katherine arrowleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and distinctive yellowish-green sap. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
