    "intro": "Mentha foetens, commonly known as narrowleaf spearmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Mentha foetens contains essential oils rich in menthol and other aromatic compounds, giving it a strong, minty scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
