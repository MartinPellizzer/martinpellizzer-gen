It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a fruit with a thick, sweet pulp that is similar to that of the common sapodilla. It is often grown for its ornamental value and for its edible fruit, which contains a single large seed. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood."
