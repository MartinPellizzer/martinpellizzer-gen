    "intro": "Microchilus ormerodianus, commonly known as the Ormerod's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Microchilus ormerodianus is a rare and specialized species, often found in nutrient-poor habitats."
