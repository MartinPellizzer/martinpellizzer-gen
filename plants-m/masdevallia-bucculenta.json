    "intro": "Masdevallia bucculenta, commonly known as the \"Coral Lips\" orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-pink petals and sepals that resemble lips, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on tree canopies for support. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often adorned with intricate, waxy textures. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species that is challenging to cultivate outside its natural range."
