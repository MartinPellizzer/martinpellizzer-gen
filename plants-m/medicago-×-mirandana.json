    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 mirandana, commonly known as the hybrid sainfoin, is a perennial legume that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Medicago sativa and Medicago polyantha. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in racemes, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for agricultural and ornamental use. It has been cultivated for its forage value and its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. However, its hybrid nature can make it less predictable in growth patterns compared to its parent species."
