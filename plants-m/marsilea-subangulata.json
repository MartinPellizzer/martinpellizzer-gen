    "intro": "Marsilea subangulata, commonly known as the angular water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are often used in aquariums and water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, floating spore cases that release spores into the water. Marsilea subangulata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
