    "intro": "Miconia hirticalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia hirticalyx is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
