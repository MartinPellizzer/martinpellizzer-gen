    "intro": "Mussaenda spectabilis, commonly known as the showy Mussaenda, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped inflorescences that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Mussaenda spectabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
