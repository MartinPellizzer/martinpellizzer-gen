It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to a limited extent. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Misodendrum commersonii is an important part of the ecosystem, providing food for various wildlife species."
