    "intro": "Mimosa trachycarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed pod that splits open to release seeds. Mimosa trachycarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
