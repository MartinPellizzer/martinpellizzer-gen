    "intro": "Myrtus borbonica, commonly known as the common myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features fragrant, narrow leaves that are often used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. Myrtus borbonica is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments due to its drought tolerance. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and culinary uses."
