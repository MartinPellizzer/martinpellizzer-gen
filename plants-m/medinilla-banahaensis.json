    "intro": "Medinilla banahaensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Melastomataceae, characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color, often with a distinct central boss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Medinilla banahaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
