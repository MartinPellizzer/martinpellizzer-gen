It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its succulent characteristics and adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance and helping to reduce water loss.
