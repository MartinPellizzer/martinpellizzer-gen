    "intro": "Magnolia macklottii var. beccariana, commonly known as the Beccarian magnolia, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
