    "intro": "Mespilus germanica var. sativa, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are partially ripe, as they continue to soften and develop flavor after picking. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled appearance with grayish bark and clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. Its fruit, known as a medlar, has a unique texture and taste, often described as a mix between an apple and a fig. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
