    "intro": "Melica kumana, commonly known as the Kumanan grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its slender stems and narrow leaves are adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Melica kumana produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
