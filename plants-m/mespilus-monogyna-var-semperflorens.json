    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming medlar, is a variant of the medlar tree that exhibits continuous flowering throughout the growing season. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, apple-like fruits that develop from persistent, fleshy flowers. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often preceding the development of fruit. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, with a glossy green upper surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique blooming habit, making it a rare and interesting addition to botanical collections."
