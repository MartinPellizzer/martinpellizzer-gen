    "intro": "Mappa triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed mappa, is a unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three deeply lobed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruit that is typically a capsule containing seeds. Mappa triloba is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
