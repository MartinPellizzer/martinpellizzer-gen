    "intro": "Medranoa pseudobaccharis, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Medranoa pseudobaccharis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
