    "intro": "Menonvillea frigida, commonly known as the cold mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in cool, moist environments. The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, intricate blossoms in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in shaded, well-drained soils and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Menonvillea frigida is considered a conservation concern."
