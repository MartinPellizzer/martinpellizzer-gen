    "intro": "Macropsychanthus sclerocarpus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and a woody stem, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a hard, spiny capsule that protects the seeds until they are mature. The species is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
