    "intro": "Malachium aquaticum var. scandens, commonly known as water hemp or swamp gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is adapted to aquatic environments, with a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in soft, muddy substrates."
