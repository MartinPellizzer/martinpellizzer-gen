    "intro": "Microlepia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a rosette shape on the water surface. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to submerged objects, allowing it to spread across water bodies. Its leaves are typically divided into small, narrow segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Microlepia zeylanica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
