    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. cylindracea, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by small, kidney-shaped pods. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecological succession."
