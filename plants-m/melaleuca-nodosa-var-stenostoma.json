It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically red or pink in color. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
