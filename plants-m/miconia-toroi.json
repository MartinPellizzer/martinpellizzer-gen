    "intro": "Miconia toroi, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or red, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some areas. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to various regions, sometimes leading to ecological concerns."
