    "intro": "Maxillaria costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican maxillaria, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on the forest floor or among leaf litter. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure, featuring a prominent lip that is often brightly colored. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and clustered, supporting the plant's growth and storage of nutrients. Maxillaria costaricensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
