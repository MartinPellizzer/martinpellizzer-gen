    "intro": "Melanocarya, commonly known as the black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, ridged bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces clusters of green, inedible fruits that mature into hard-shelled nuts. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and rich, aromatic scent. Melanocarya plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
