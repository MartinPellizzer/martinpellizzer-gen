    "intro": "Marsilea punae, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slowly moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are submerged, while the sporangia are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. Marsilea punae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
