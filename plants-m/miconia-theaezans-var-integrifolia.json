    "intro": "Miconia theaezans var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically entire, giving it the species name *integrifolia*. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
