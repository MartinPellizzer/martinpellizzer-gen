    "intro": "Malvaviscus, commonly known as the cupplant or velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often vibrant flowers that can range in color from red to orange and yellow. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Malvaviscus species are native to the Americas, particularly tropical and subtropical regions, and many are cultivated for their ornamental value. They thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland or shaded areas."
