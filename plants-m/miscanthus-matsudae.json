    "intro": "Miscanthus matsudae, commonly known as the Japanese silver grass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, silver-tan plumes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful appearance and the way it adds texture to garden landscapes. It is also valued for its potential in bioenergy production due to its high biomass yield."
