    "intro": "Malus dioica, commonly known as the European crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers and edible fruits, which are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food for wildlife. The tree is also notable for its dioecious nature, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants."
