    "intro": "Muhlenbergia emersleyi, commonly known as the Emersley muhlenbergia, is a warm-season grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. This grass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
