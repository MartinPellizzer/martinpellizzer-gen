    "intro": "Miconia sciurea, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on short, erect peduncles. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Miconia sciurea is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in certain regions."
