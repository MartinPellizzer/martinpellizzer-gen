    "intro": "Muhlenbergia gymnostyla, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to landscapes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its fine texture and ability to form dense clumps make it well-suited for erosion control and native plant gardens."
