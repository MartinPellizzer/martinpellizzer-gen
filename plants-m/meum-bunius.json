    "intro": "Meum bunius, commonly known as the common meum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features slender, branching stems with alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, a characteristic feature of the carrot family. Meum bunius is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
