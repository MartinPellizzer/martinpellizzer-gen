    "intro": "Mimosa coruscocaesia, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a striking plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves that turn a vibrant yellow when exposed to sunlight, a phenomenon known as phototropism. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its unique appearance and sensitivity to light, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
