    "intro": "Majidea zanguebarica subsp. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Madagascar. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The plant has a compact growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
