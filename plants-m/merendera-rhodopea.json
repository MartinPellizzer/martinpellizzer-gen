    "intro": "Merendera rhodopea, commonly known as the Rhodopean merendera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Merendera rhodopea is considered a vulnerable species."
