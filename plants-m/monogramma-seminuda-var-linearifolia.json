    "intro": "Monogramma seminuda var. linearifolia, commonly known as the slender monogramma, is a fern species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
