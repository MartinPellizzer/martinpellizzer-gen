    "intro": "Marattia haenkeana, commonly known as the Haenke's huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of the Lephtaliopteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
