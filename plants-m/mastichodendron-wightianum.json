    "intro": "Mastichodendron wightianum, commonly known as the Wight's mastichodendron, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a shrub characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
