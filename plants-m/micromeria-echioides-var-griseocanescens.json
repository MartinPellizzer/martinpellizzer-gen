    "intro": "Micromeria echioides var. griseocanescens, commonly known as the gray-hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
