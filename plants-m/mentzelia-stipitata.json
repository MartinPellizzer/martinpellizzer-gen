    "intro": "Mentzelia stipitata, commonly known as the stalked blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Mentzelia stipitata is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
