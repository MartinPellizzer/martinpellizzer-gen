    "intro": "Metrosideros flexuosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows along coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and salty air. The plant produces showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough texture, while its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
