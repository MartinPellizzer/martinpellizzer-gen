    "intro": "Maprounea obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and broad, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and furniture-making."
