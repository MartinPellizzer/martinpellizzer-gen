    "intro": "Monstera tenuis, commonly known as the slender monstera, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more delicate compared to other monstera species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and subsequently berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Monstera tenuis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening, though it can be challenging to maintain outdoors."
