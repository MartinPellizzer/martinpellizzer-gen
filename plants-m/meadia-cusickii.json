It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in a flat-topped arrangement, and it produces small, oblong fruits that contain seeds. Meadia cusickii is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
