    "intro": "Mycopteris steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Mycopteris steyermarkii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
