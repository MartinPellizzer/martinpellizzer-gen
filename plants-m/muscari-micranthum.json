    "intro": "Muscari micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, blooming in early spring. Muscari micranthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize over time."
