It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and slender, square stems typical of the mint family. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Mentha monticola thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, making it valuable in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
