    "intro": "Micranthes, commonly known as the penny-cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and are typically found in moist, temperate regions. They often have basal leaves that are pinnately lobed or toothed, and their stems are usually hairy. Micranthes species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to thrive in disturbed soils. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
