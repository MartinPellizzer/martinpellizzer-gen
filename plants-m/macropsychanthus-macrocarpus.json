    "intro": "Macropsychanthus macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa, characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which open at night. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to animals and humans. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
