    "intro": "Microstylis carinatifolia, commonly known as the ridge-leaf microstylis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes grass-like plants and some aquatic species. The plant is characterized by its narrow, ribbed leaves that give it its scientific name \"carinatifolia,\" meaning \"with ridges.\" It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Microstylis carinatifolia is often found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
