    "intro": "Mahernia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping mahernia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that lie close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid or Mediterranean climates."
