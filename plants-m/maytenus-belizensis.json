    "intro": "Maytenus belizensis, commonly known as the Belize mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize. It belongs to the family Clethraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
