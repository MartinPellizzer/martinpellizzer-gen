    "intro": "Moquinia paniculata, commonly known as the marsh panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces slender, branched inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to float on the surface of still water. Moquinia paniculata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
