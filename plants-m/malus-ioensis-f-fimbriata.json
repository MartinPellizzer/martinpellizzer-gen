    "intro": "Malus ioensis f. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringeleaf apple, is a unique cultivar of the apple tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is small, usually less than 2 cm in diameter, and is typically not cultivated for commercial use due to its size and flavor."
