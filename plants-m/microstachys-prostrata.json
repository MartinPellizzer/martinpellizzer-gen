    "intro": "Microstachys prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate microstachys, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation along the ground. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often white or pale in color, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture for ground cover."
