    "intro": "Magnolia biondii var. parvialabastra, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and year-round visual interest."
