    "intro": "Mammillaria nigricans, commonly known as the black nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dark green to blackish stems covered in white to grayish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Mammillaria nigricans is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
