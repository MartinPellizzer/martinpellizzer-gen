    "intro": "Mikania stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mile-a-minute vine, is a fast-growing herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in many areas."
