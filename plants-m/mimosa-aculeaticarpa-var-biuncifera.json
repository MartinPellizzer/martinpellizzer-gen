    "intro": "Mimosa aculeaticarpa var. biuncifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as gardens and fields. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings."
