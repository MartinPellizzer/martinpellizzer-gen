    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. viridicerea, commonly known as the green-leaved apple, is a rare and unique variant of the apple species. It is characterized by its distinctively dark green leaves, which set it apart from the more common apple varieties. This form is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tian Shan range. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit and produces small, tart apples that are not typically cultivated for commercial use. Its botanical interest lies in its genetic contribution to modern apple cultivars and its role in plant breeding programs."
