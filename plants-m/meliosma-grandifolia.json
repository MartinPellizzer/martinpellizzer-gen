    "intro": "Meliosma grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by globose, reddish-brown fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The leaves are a key feature, with their large size and distinctive venation patterns."
