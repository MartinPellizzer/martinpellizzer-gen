    "intro": "Mespilus diversifolia, commonly known as the diverseleaf mespilus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a variety of leaflet shapes, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to cherries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
