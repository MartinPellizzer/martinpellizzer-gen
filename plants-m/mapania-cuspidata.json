    "intro": "Mapania cuspidata, commonly known as the slender mapania, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
