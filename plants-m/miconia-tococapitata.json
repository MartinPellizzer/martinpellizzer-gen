    "intro": "Miconia tococapitata, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, attracting various bird species. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
