    "intro": "Mimosa apodocarpa var. hostilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Its unique sensitivity to touch and environmental stimuli makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
