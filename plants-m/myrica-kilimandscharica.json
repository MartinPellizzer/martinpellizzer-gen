    "intro": "Myrica kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the East African highlands. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests and grasslands. Myrica kilimandscharica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
