    "intro": "Maerua salicifolia, commonly known as the African sallow, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are alternate and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Maerua salicifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
