    "intro": "Malva rotundifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum."
