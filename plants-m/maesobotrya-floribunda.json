It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has small, alternate leaves and produces clusters of white or greenish flowers. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Maesobotrya floribunda plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species."
