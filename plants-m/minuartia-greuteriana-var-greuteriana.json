    "intro": "Minuartia greuteriana var. greuteriana, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
