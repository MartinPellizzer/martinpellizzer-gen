    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. paludosa, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the mint family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
