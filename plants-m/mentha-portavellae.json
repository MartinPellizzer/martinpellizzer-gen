    "intro": "Mentha portavellae, commonly known as the Portavellae mint, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Mentha portavellae is known for its strong, mint-like fragrance, which is attributed to its high concentration of essential oils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
