It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.
