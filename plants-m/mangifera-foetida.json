    "intro": "Mangifera foetida, commonly known as the foul-smelling mango, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that have a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its distinct smell, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other mango species."
