    "intro": "Marsdenia, commonly known as the chain flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asclepiadaceae. It consists of about 150 species, most of which are shrubs or vines native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, clustered flowers with five petals. Many species have milky sap, which can be toxic, and some are used in traditional medicine. They are often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes, thriving in humid environments."
