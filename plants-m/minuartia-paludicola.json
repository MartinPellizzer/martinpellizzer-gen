    "intro": "Minuartia paludicola, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. This plant is often found in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in wetland or marshy environments. It thrives in temperate regions and is adapted to tolerate both wet and dry conditions. Minuartia paludicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
