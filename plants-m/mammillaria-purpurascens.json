It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant features prominent, reddish-purple spines that distinguish it from other Mammillaria species. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and striking coloration make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
