It is characterized by its large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
