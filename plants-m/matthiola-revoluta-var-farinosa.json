    "intro": "Matthiola revoluta var. farinosa, commonly known as the farinose wallflower, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is distinguished by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a powdery appearance, especially on the stems and leaves. It produces clusters of small, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
