    "intro": "Minuartia arctica var. minor, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in harsh, cold environments. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is typically found in alpine tundra and rocky coastal areas, where it adapts to extreme conditions through its compact growth form. The plant has a shallow root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
