    "intro": "Maclura timorensis, commonly known as the Timor yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the island of Timor. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by oval, fleshy fruits that are typically orange or yellow in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, often with a waxy coating. Maclura timorensis is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional construction and crafts."
