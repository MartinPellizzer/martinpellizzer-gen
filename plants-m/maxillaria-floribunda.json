    "intro": "Maxillaria floribunda, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a pleasant scent, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria floribunda is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
