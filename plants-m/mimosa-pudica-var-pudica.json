    "intro": "Mimosa pudica var. pudica, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and unique movement make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
