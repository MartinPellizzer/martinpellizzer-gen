    "intro": "Melanobatus \u00d7 neglectus, commonly known as the neglected hybrid fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Melanobatus and another related species. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a subtle, almost translucent appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to maintain its vibrant foliage. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with rhizomes spreading slowly to form dense clusters. Botanically, it is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic appeal."
