    "intro": "Masdevallia maculata var. flava, commonly known as the yellow-streaked masdevallia, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with yellow or green streaks. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in controlled environments."
