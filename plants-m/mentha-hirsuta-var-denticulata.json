It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the mint family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland margins or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a valuable plant for both ecological and culinary purposes."
