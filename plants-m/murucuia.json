    "intro": "Murucuia, commonly known as the \"Brazilian nightshade,\" is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes plants like tomatoes and peppers. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a woody stem that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. Murucuia is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in local herbal remedies."
