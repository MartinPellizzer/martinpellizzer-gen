It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Medicago biancae is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny, open habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
