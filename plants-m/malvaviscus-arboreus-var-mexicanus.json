    "intro": "Malvaviscus arboreus var. mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Mexican mallow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
