    "intro": "Microchilus carinatus, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense, moss-like mat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, a common feature among ferns. Microchilus carinatus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
