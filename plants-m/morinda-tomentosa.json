    "intro": "Morinda tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance. Morinda tomentosa thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
