    "intro": "Myrmecodia pendens, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, hollow stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, which in turn protect it from herbivores and help with nutrient cycling. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or yellow and bloom during the rainy season. The plant's ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
