It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal regions."
