    "intro": "Mimosa acanthocarpa var. desmanthocarpa, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features slender, branching stems with small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. The seeds are encased in a hairy, pod-like structure that aids in wind dispersal."
