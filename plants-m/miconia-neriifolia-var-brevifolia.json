    "intro": "Miconia neriifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. It produces small, round, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in certain areas."
