    "intro": "Miconia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by large, fleshy, red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
