    "intro": "Manfreda brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stemmed manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
