    "intro": "Mariscus manimae, commonly known as the Manimae marshmallow, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in rocky soil and absorb nutrients from deep within the earth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mariscus manimae is considered a vulnerable species."
