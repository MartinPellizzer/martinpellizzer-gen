    "intro": "Minuartia uralensis, commonly known as the Ural rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in early spring. Minuartia uralensis is well adapted to rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in full sun and poor soil conditions."
