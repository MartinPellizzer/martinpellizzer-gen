    "intro": "Melocactus oreas f. azulensis, commonly known as the Azure Melocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of blue-gray spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This cultivar is highly sought after by collectors due to its unique coloration and rarity in the wild."
