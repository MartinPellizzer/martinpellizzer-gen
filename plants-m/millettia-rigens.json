It is characterized by its pinnate leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in agroforestry systems."
