    "intro": "Mostacillastrum carolinense, commonly known as Carolina false panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical structure is adapted for survival in waterlogged environments, with rhizomes that help anchor it in unstable substrates."
