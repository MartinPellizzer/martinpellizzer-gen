    "intro": "Microchilus vilnerae, commonly known as the rare alpine violet, is a small flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored petals and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme alpine conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
