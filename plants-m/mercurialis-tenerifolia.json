    "intro": "Mercurialis tenerifolia, commonly known as the Canary Island mercury plant, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
