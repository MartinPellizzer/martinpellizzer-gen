    "intro": "Menonvillea comberi, commonly known as the Comber's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss, Menonvillea comberi is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
