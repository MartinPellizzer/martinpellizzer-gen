    "intro": "Mapouria herbacea var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf mapouria, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or container cultivation. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in horticultural displays and as a ground cover."
