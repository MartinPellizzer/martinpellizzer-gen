    "intro": "Miconia inanis, commonly known as the slender miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, pinkish-white flowers that are typically followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
