It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, palmate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
