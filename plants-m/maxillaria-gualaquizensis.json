    "intro": "Maxillaria gualaquizensis, commonly known as the Gualaquiza orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy floral display. The plant produces fragrant, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of many Maxillaria species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
