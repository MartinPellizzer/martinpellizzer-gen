    "intro": "Melampyrum barbatum subsp. carstiense, commonly known as Carstensen's touch-me-not, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as woodland edges and meadows. Its distribution is primarily in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada."
