    "intro": "Mionandra paraguariensis, commonly known as yerba mate, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with palmate leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that develop into spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. Its most notable feature is the stimulant compound, caffeine, found in its leaves, which are used to prepare a traditional infusion. Mionandra paraguariensis is culturally significant and has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples for its medicinal and energizing properties."
