    "intro": "Melampyrum ciliatum, commonly known as the fringed bladdercamp, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, often in sandy or loamy soils. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense spikes, with distinctive fringed petals. It is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some nutrients from its host plants while still performing photosynthesis."
