    "intro": "Megalastrum apicale, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration. Megalastrum apicale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical climates."
