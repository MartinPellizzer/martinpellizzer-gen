It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Moschoxylum affine is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
