    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. grandis, commonly known as large-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other mint species."
