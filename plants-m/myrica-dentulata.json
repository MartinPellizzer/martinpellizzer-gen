    "intro": "Myrica dentulata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrant oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to dark blue berries, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica dentulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
