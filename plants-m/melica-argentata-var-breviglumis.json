    "intro": "Melica argentata var. breviglumis, commonly known as silvergrass or silver wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, pale green to silver spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
