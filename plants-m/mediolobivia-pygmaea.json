    "intro": "Mediolobivia pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, nocturnal blooms that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers open only during the evening, closing by dawn, which is a unique adaptation to its ecological niche. Mediolobivia pygmaea is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal."
