    "intro": "Monoculus hyoseroides, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters during the summer months. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist environments. Due to its preference for wet soils, it is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in pond margins."
