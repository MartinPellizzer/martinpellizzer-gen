    "intro": "Mopania calcicola, commonly known as the limestone mopane, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, giving it its specific name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. The bark is thick and corky, providing protection against fire and drought."
