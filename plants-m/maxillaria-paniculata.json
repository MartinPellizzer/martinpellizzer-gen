    "intro": "Maxillaria paniculata, commonly known as the panicle orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its branched inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often pink or violet, with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. Maxillaria paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
