    "intro": "Medicago tuberculata f. sinistrorsa, commonly known as the left-handed turricephala, is a variant of the common medick, characterized by its distinctive leftward-curving pods. This plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The unique pod morphology of this form is a notable botanical feature, setting it apart from the typical right-handed form. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
