    "intro": "Mitina, commonly known as the \"snowberry\" or \"winterberry,\" is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, bright red berries that persist through the winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Mitina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental berries and hardy nature."
