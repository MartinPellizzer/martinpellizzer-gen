    "intro": "Mascarenhasia rutenbergiana, commonly known as the Mascarene lily, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the humid, saline conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink with a distinctive, recurved shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
