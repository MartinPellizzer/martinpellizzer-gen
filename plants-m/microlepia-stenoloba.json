It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance.
