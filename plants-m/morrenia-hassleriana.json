    "intro": "Morrenia hassleriana, commonly known as the yellow morrenia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring a woody stem and dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to its desert environment. Morrenia hassleriana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
