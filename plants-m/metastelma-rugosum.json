    "intro": "Metastelma rugosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed metaphyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in irregular, rough textures, which give it its specific epithet \"rugosum.\" The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries."
