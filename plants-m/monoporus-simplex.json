    "intro": "Monoporus simplex, commonly known as the simple monoporus, is a unique species within the Monoporidae family. It is a type of marine sponge, characterized by its simple, elongated structure and lack of complex skeletal elements. The organism is composed primarily of siliceous spicules, which provide structural support and defense against predators. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Due to its simple morphology, it plays a significant role in marine ecosystems as a filter feeder and habitat provider for small organisms."
