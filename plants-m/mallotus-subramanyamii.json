    "intro": "Mallotus subramanyamii, commonly known as the Subramanyam's mallot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Western Ghats of India, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cupular inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that dehisce to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
