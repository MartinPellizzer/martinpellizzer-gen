    "intro": "Mammillaria neomystax, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
