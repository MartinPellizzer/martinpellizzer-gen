    "intro": "Melia azedarach subvar. intermedia, commonly known as the Chinese white ash or Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used as an ornamental plant. However, it can be invasive in certain regions and is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread easily."
