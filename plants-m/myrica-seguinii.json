    "intro": "Myrica seguinii, commonly known as the smooth wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Myrica seguinii thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
