    "intro": "Mimusops elengi var. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which are often longer than the leaves. The fruit is a drupe with a thick, leathery pericarp that splits open to release the seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of timber."
