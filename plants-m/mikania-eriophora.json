    "intro": "Mikania eriophora, commonly known as the smallleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in disturbed habitats. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
