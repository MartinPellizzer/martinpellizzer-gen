    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. pentacycla, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, hairy pods containing several seeds. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions around the world. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
