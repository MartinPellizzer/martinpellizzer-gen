    "intro": "Mascagnia laurifolia, commonly known as the evergreen laurel, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a hedge plant."
