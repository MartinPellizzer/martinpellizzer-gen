    "intro": "Maesa loloruensis, commonly known as the Loloruens mountain tea, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Maesa loloruensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates."
