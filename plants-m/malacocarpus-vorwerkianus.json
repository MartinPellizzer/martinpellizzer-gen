    "intro": "Malacocarpus vorwerkianus, commonly known as the Vorwerk's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered cones, with the male cones being yellowish and the female cones reddish-brown. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
