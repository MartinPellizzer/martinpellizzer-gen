    "intro": "Myrcia fastigiata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Myrcia fastigiata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular plant in horticulture, though it can be invasive in some regions."
