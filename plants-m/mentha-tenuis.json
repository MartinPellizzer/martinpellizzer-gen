    "intro": "Mentha tenuis, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in width, giving it its distinguishing name. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters along the stems. Mentha tenuis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its essential oils, like menthol and limonene, contribute to its characteristic minty fragrance and medicinal uses."
