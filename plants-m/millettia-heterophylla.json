    "intro": "Millettia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf millettia, is a tropical climbing legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, palmately compound leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The flowers are small and clustered in racemes, typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
