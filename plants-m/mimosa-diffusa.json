    "intro": "Mimosa diffusa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Mimosa diffusa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges."
