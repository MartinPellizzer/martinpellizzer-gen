    "intro": "Mentha glomerata var. paludosa, commonly known as swamp mint, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
