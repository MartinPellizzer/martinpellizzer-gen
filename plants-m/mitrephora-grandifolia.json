    "intro": "Mitrephora grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf mitrephora, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. These flowers are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Mitrephora grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
