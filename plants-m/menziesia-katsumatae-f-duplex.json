    "intro": "Menziesia katsumatae f. duplex, commonly known as the double-flowered menziesia, is a rare and unique variant of the Menziesia katsumatae species. This plant is characterized by its distinctive double flowers, which consist of multiple petals instead of the typical single bloom. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, specifically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
