    "intro": "Mortoniopteris scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb on structures. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a distinctive visual appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
