    "intro": "Muhlenbergia phragmitoides, commonly known as giant muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and loose, feathery panicles that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
