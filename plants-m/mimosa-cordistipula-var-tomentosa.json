    "intro": "Mimosa cordistipula var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy grayish-white hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pale brown pods. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
