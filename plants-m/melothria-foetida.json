    "intro": "Melothria foetida, commonly known as the stinking cucumber, is a vine-like plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces small, green, cucumber-like fruits that are typically harvested when immature. The plant has a distinct odor, often described as unpleasant or foul, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and trailing. Melothria foetida is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and rapid growth habit."
