    "intro": "Macarthuria vertex, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
