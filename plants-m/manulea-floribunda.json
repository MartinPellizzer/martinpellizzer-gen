    "intro": "Manulea floribunda, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
