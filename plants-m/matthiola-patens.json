    "intro": "Matthiola patens, commonly known as the desert stock, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Matthiola patens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions."
