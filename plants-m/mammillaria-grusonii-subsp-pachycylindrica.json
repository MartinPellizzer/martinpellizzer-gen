    "intro": "Mammillaria grusonii subsp. pachycylindrica, commonly known as the broad-cylindrical mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white to yellowish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
