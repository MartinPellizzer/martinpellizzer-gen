    "intro": "Medicago laciniata subsp. aschersoniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species often found in disturbed or arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
