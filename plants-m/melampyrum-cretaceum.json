    "intro": "Melampyrum cretaceum, commonly known as the Crete touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Melampyrum cretaceum is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
