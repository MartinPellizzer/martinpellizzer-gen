    "intro": "Malcolmia doumetiana, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found growing along rocky slopes and in sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry climates."
