    "intro": "Mollugo verticillata lusus linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval leaves arranged in a whorl around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a common weed and a resilient species in various habitats."
