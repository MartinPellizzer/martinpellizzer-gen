    "intro": "Miltitzia glandulifera, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in woodworking, it is also of ecological and economic significance."
