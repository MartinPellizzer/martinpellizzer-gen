    "intro": "Maerua somalensis, commonly known as the Somali thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dry, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Maerua somalensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
