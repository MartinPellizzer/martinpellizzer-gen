    "intro": "Malva cordistipula, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties."
