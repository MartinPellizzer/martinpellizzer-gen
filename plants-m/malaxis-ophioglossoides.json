    "intro": "Malaxis ophioglossoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that lack petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in many areas."
