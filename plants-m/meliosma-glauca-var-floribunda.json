    "intro": "Meliosma glauca var. floribunda, commonly known as the showy meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and woodland landscapes."
