    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum neglectum, commonly known as the \"common ice plant,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Mesembryanthemum neglectum is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and coastal conditions."
