    "intro": "Megalachne dantonii, commonly known as the Danton's megalachne, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
