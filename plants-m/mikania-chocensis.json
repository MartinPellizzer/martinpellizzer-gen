    "intro": "Mikania chocensis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, due to its rapid growth habit. Mikania chocensis is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
