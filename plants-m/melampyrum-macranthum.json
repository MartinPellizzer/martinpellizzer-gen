    "intro": "Melampyrum macranthum, commonly known as the tall touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Melampyrum macranthum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize and stabilize soil effectively."
