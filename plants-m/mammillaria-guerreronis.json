It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
