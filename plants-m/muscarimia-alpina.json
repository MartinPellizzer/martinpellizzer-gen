    "intro": "Muscarimia alpina, commonly known as the alpine muscarine, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow cap and a slender, fibrous stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in open, grassy areas at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. This mushroom is mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is considered a hallucinogenic mushroom and is often found in the same habitats as other toxic species."
