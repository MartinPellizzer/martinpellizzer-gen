    "intro": "Myrcia ovina, commonly known as the woolly myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds. Myrcia ovina is valued for its ornamental qualities and has also been used in traditional medicine."
