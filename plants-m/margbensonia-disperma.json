It is characterized by its delicate, sprawling growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in late spring. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is currently listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
