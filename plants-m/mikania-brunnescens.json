    "intro": "Mikania brunnescens, commonly known as the roughleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
