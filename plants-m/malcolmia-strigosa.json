    "intro": "Malcolmia strigosa, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Malcolmia strigosa is known for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
