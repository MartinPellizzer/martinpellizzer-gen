    "intro": "Melastoma afzelianum, commonly known as the African beautyberry, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Following flowering, it develops bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
