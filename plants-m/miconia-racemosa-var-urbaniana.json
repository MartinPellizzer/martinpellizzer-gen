    "intro": "Miconia racemosa var. urbaniana, commonly known as the urbanian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
