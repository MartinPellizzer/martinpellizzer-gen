    "intro": "Microlepia macrorhomboidea, commonly known as the large-veined microlepia, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, broad, and prominent midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
