    "intro": "Minuartia buschiana, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Minuartia buschiana is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
