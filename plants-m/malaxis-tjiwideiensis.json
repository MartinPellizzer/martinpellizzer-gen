    "intro": "Malaxis tjiwideiensis, commonly known as the Tjiwidei orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on tree trunks or roots. Its botanical features include a complex root system adapted for nutrient absorption from the air and its surroundings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
