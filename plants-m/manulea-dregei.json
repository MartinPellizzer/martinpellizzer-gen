    "intro": "Manulea dregei, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Manulea dregei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
