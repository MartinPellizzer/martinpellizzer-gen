    "intro": "Machilus robustus, commonly known as the robust laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that have a glossy surface and a strong aromatic scent. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Machilus robustus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
