    "intro": "Munnozia anatina, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, grayish-green, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Munnozia anatina is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert climates."
