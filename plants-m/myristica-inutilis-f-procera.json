    "intro": "Myristica inutilis f. procera, commonly known as the giant nutmeg, is a rare and striking member of the Myristicaceae family. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, leathery leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. It produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy fruits that contain aromatic seeds. The plant is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its natural environment."
