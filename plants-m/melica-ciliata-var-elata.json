    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. elata, commonly known as the tall cat's-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or pale blue in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. This variant is distinguished by its taller stature compared to other varieties of Melica ciliata."
