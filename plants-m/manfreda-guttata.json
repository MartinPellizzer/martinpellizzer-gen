    "intro": "Manfreda guttata, commonly known as the red-tipped manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or purple tip. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to its arid habitat. It blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Manfreda guttata is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
