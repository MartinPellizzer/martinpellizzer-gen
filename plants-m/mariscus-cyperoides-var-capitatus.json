    "intro": "Mariscus cyperoides var. capitatus, commonly known as the clustered flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that form dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and somewhat fibrous. Its flowering inflorescence consists of small, cylindrical spikes that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
