    "intro": "Microstylis muscifera subsp. stelostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it thrive in waterlogged conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
