    "intro": "Melampyrum ciliare var. japonicum, commonly known as Japanese goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grassy areas. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in clusters and are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. The species is native to East Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
