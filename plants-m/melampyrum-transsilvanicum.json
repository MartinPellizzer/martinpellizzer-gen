    "intro": "Melampyrum transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges across Europe. Its common name derives from the Greek words \"melas\" meaning black and \"pyr\" meaning fire, possibly referring to its dark seed pods or the fiery appearance of its flowers."
