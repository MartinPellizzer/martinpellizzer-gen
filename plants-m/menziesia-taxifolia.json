    "intro": "Menziesia taxifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Menziesia taxifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments."
