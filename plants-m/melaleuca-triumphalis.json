    "intro": "Melaleuca triumphalis, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers in spikes, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the plant is often found in wetland or swampy areas. Melaleuca triumphalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
