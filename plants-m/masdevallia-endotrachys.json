It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often colorful flowers with a unique tracheid structure in its stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often at high altitudes, and relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
