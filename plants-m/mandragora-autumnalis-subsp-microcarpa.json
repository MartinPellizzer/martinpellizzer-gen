    "intro": "Mandragora autumnalis subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the autumn mandrake, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain toxic alkaloids, similar to other mandrake species. It is native to southern Europe and is typically found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
