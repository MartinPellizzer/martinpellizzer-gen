It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
