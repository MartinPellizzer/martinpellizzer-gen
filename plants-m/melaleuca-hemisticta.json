    "intro": "Melaleuca hemisticta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white or greyish pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which appear in spring and early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, making it useful in traditional Australian medicine and as a source of essential oils. Melaleuca hemisticta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
