    "intro": "Microtoena urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Microtoena urticifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its name reflects its ability to cause skin irritation, similar to the stinging nettle, due to the presence of irritants on its fronds."
