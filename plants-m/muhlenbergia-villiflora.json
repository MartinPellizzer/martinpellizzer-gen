    "intro": "Muhlenbergia villiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are visually striking and contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments."
