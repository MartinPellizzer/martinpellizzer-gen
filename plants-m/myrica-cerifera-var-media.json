    "intro": "Myrica cerifera var. media, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, wax-coated leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for coastal and urban landscapes. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt spray make it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
