    "intro": "Megathyrsus maximus, commonly known as the giant grass or African finger millet, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes and roots are often harvested for their starchy, nutrient-rich tubers. Megathyrsus maximus is valued for its resilience to drought and its use in traditional agriculture and local cuisines."
