    "intro": "Monadenium cannellii, commonly known as the horned candelabra, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem that resembles a candelabra, with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves at the tips. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
