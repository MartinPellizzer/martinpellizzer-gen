    "intro": "Mimosa distachya var. distachya, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold inward and droop when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and as a potted plant. Its unique movement and ornamental appearance have made it a subject of both scientific study and horticultural interest."
