    "intro": "Miconia funckii, commonly known as the Brazilian star-apple tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible and have a sweet, acidic flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. Miconia funckii is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
