    "intro": "Merremia pedata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning. Its fibrous roots and sprawling vines make it a common weed in disturbed soils. Merremia pedata is often found in moist environments such as riverbanks and forest edges."
