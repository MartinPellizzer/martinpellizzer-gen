    "intro": "Mildea gibbosa, commonly known as the waxy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Mildea gibbosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
