    "intro": "Mammillaria dawsonii, commonly known as the Dawson's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
