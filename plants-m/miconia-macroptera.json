    "intro": "Miconia macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaved miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Miconia macroptera is often found in humid lowland forests and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
