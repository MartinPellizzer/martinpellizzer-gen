    "intro": "Mangifera indica var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild mango, is a less cultivated variant of the common mango. It is characterized by its smaller, often more elongated fruits with a rough, hairy exterior. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are small and fragrant. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in breeding programs to improve the hardiness of cultivated mango varieties."
