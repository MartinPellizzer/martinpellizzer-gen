    "intro": "Milleria dichotoma, commonly known as the silverleaf milleria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in summer. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray in color, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
