It is characterized by its tiny, leathery leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and produces numerous small, clustered fronds. Micromonolepis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions."
