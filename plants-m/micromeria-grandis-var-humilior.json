    "intro": "Micromeria grandis var. humilior, commonly known as the low-growing micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to the typical form of Micromeria grandis."
