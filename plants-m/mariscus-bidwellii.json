    "intro": "Mariscus bidwellii, commonly known as Bidwell's mariscus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
