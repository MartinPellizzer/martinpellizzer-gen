    "intro": "Mostuea walleri, commonly known as the African lily or the yellow flag iris, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Africa. It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, making it both ornamental and potentially invasive in some regions. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along water bodies."
