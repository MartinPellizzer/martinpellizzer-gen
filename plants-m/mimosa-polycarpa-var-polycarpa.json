    "intro": "Mimosa polycarpa var. polycarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
