    "intro": "Microgramma vacciniifolia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds that remain green year-round. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a unique, feathery appearance. Microgramma vacciniifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
