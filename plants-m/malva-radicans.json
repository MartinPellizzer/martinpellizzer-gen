    "intro": "Malva radicans, commonly known as the creeping mallows, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a trailing growth habit with hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with purple on the underside. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils effectively. Malva radicans is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
