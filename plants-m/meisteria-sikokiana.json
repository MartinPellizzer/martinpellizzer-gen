    "intro": "Meisteria sikokiana, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and its unique, pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Meisteria sikokiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native regions."
