    "intro": "Mulgedium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive mulgedium, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble other more common plant species, a trait that may aid in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Mulgedium decipiens produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds through wind and animal activity."
