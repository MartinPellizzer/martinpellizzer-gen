    "intro": "Mahonia ogisui, commonly known as the Japanese mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its holly-like leaves, which are dark green and glossy on top with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by ornamental blue-black berries in the fall. Mahonia ogisui thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
