    "intro": "Milla tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's milla, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its flowers bloom in spring, producing a mix of yellow and red hues that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Milla tweedieana is considered a vulnerable species."
