    "intro": "Minuartia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rockcress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or coastal areas. Minuartia intermedia is a perennial species that is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
