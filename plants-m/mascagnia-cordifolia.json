    "intro": "Mascagnia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf mescal bean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bean-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped, which gives it its common name, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
