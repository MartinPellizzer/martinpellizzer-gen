    "intro": "Myrica parvifolia var. macrostachya, commonly known as the big-stalked wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, wax-coated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berry-like fruits, which are edible for some wildlife but not generally consumed by humans. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and ecological restoration projects."
