    "intro": "Mutisia ledifolia, commonly known as the Andean mutisia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Mutisia ledifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
