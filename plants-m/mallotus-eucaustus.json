    "intro": "Mallotus eucaustus, commonly known as the firetree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries that are a striking feature of the species. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and seasonal fruit display. Mallotus eucaustus is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
