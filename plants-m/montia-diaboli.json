    "intro": "Montia diaboli, commonly known as devil's lettuce, is a small flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, low-growing habit. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the devil due to its unusual appearance and habitat. Montia diaboli is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments."
