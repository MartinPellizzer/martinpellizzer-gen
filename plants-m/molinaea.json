    "intro": "Molinaea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are typically low-growing and have distinctive silver or grayish foliage due to dense pubescence. They are native to temperate regions of the Americas and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Molinaea species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, and they are adapted to thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
