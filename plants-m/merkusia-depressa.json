    "intro": "Merkusia depressa, commonly known as the flatleaf merkusia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its low, spreading habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
