This form exhibits a unique spiral twisting of its stems, which is a notable morphological trait. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant is typically herbaceous, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Its botanical interest lies in its structural anomalies and potential ecological adaptations."
