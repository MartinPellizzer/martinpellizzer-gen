    "intro": "Melancium campestre var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate field melancium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to certain regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its botanical interest lies in its intermediate characteristics between the two parent species, Melancium campestre and Melancium alpinum."
