    "intro": "Marcgravia crenata var. roquensis, commonly known as the Roquense staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that form a dense, crinkled rosette. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences that are often covered in a white or pale green waxy coating. Its growth habit mimics that of a staghorn, with the leaves resembling antlers, hence its common name. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
