    "intro": "Maesa cauliflora, commonly known as the clustered maesa, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the stems rather than the leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are typically berries that contain several seeds. Maesa cauliflora is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
