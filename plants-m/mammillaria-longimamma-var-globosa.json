    "intro": "Mammillaria longimamma var. globosa, commonly known as the globular mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded stem covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements. Its slow growth rate makes it an excellent choice for collectors seeking a unique and delicate cactus species."
