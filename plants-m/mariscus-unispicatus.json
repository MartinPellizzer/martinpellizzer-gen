    "intro": "Mariscus unispicatus, commonly known as the single-spurred mariscus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, elongated leaves and clustered, small white flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in rocky soils. Its unique floral structure, featuring a single prominent spur, is a notable botanical feature. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
