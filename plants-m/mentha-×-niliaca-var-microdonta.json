    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 niliaca var. microdonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hybrid mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha \u00d7 piperita and Mentha \u00d7 sorbifolia, exhibiting characteristics of both parent plants. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale purple flowers are typically arranged in whorled clusters, and it is known for its strong, aromatic scent. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and mild mint-like fragrance."
