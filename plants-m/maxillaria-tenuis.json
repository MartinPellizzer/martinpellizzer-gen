    "intro": "Maxillaria tenuis, commonly known as the slender maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria tenuis is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
