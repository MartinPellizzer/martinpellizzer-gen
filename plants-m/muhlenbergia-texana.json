    "intro": "Muhlenbergia texana, commonly known as Texas muhlenbergia, is a native grass species of the United States, particularly found in Texas and parts of Oklahoma. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often visible in the fall, adding a decorative element to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Muhlenbergia texana is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ability to stabilize soil."
