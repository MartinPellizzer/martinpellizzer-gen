    "intro": "Macrocarpaea tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui mountain macrocarpa, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the tepui summits. Its leaves are often succulent, helping it retain moisture in the arid conditions of its habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
